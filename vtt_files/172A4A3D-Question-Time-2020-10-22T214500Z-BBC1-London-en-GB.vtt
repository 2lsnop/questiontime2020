1
00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:03.272
Not on your nelly!

2
00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:14.564
Is this the start of the second wave?

3
00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:15.647
Only time will tell.

4
00:00:15.647 --> 00:00:17.856
The main lab,
it’s at capacity, currently.

5
00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:20.856
We have patients who have been
waiting out the Covid crisis

6
00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:23.439
to be able to feel safe
coming back to the hospital.

7
00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.856
The great thing about the NHS
is we always tend to find a way.

8
00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:28.314
Whatever it takes.

9
00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:36.606
Are you ready? Yes. Yeah. Ready.

10
00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:37.647
Action!

11
00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:41.356
Hello!

12
00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:42.856
# I’m on the big stage

13
00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.439
# I got my crew... #

14
00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.647
Welcome back to our kitchen.

15
00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:47.356
# I’ll get you moving... #
I like it.

16
00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.356
# It’s what I do... #

17
00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:49.439
Really smooth.

18
00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.897
# Let me show you
what it’s all about... #

19
00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:53.689
Shall we liven this gaff up
a little bit?

20
00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:55.106
# I’m gonna light it up

21
00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:57.022
# Yeah, I’m gonna light it up

22
00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:59.981
# Let me show you
what it’s all about... #

23
00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:01.147
Here we go.

24
00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.231

00:02:35.647 --> 00:02:39.064
Good evening.

41
00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.439
Welcome to my guest here
in the studio and to

ProfessorJoseph Stiglitz who joins
us down the line from New York.

43
00:02:52.897 --> 00:02:55.272
Our live audience is with us
again via video link,

44
00:02:55.272 --> 00:02:57.689
this evening from Sedgefield,
which of course is every bit

45
00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.522
as exciting as New York,
very good to have you with us

46
00:03:00.522 --> 00:03:03.689
and for all of you watching at home,
do join in the conversation.

47
00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.522
You know how to do it by now,
on social media, @bbcquestiontime,

48
00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:09.689
it is good to have your company,
let us know what you think.

49
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.522
Right, let’s take our first question
tonight, which is from Steven Way.

50
00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:13.606
Thank you, Fiona.

51
00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:14.647
Good evening everyone.

52
00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:18.022
Why did Rishi Sunak wait so long
to come up with today’s new plan

53
00:03:18.022 --> 00:03:20.647
when so much of the uk has been
struggling for weeks?

54
00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.564
So, why did you wait so long, Nicky?

55
00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:25.731
Well, actually, what has happened,
this is the third time in a month

56
00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:28.106
that Rishi has responded
to the developing situation and that

57
00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:31.189
obviously comes on the back of over
£200 billion of economic support

58
00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.106
that the Chancellor
and the government have

59
00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:39.147
given to businesses,
to those who are self—employed

60
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.981
and to individuals, in this
completely unprecedented year.

61
00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:46.314
But why has he waited until now,
given the huge row there was over

62
00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:48.231
Greater Manchester just on Tuesday?

63
00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:49.897
This must have been in the pipeline?

64
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.147
Why not announce it then?

65
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.522
Well, because I think obviously
it takes time to work

66
00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:58.522
through the ramifications
of the package and don’t forget,

67
00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.314
of course, the furlough scheme,
originally set up in Spring,

68
00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:04.897
only expires at the end
of this month, so actually

69
00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:06.897
it is about looking
at what is the situation,

70
00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:09.772
what is the support that is needed
and listening to what people

71
00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:12.189
are saying and, of course,
Greater Manchester, as the other

72
00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.522
areas who have gone into Tier 3 have
had that additional support as well.

73
00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:17.689
Money that local authorities
will also be able to

74
00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.522
hand out to businesses.

75
00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:22.397
I think this has been unprecedented
and just look at the impact

76
00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:25.397
on our public finances.

77
00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:28.022
The right thing to do,
but at some point that Bill

78
00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:29.939
is obviously going to have
to be paid.

79
00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:34.897
Bridget.

80
00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:40.689
It is incredible that it has taken
so long and we, you know,

81
00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.314
I just do not accept that things
have changed so much

82
00:04:43.314 --> 00:04:45.231
that it is required,
that level of adjustment.

83
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:47.897
They promised us a winter economy
plan, not very long ago

84
00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:51.064
at all and we are not even
into the winter, the situation has

85
00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:54.606
not changed so much that he needs
to revise that and itjust does not

86
00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.064
represent a long—term plan for how
we get through this.

87
00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:00.314
We have seen lots ofjobs lost,
while this in action has been there.

88
00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.897
You know, businesses are going bust,
people losing theirjobs,

89
00:05:02.897 --> 00:05:05.856
it is a matter of days
until what we have got in place

90
00:05:05.856 --> 00:05:08.689
expires and all of that worry
and anxiety that is being caused,

91
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.106
he has had to undo problems
of his own making and that is not

92
00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:14.231
good enough, when you are dealing
with the situation

93
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.731
that is unprecedented.

94
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.022
But people’s livelihoods
are on the line here and, you know,

95
00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:21.939
the health response and economic
response is going to have to be

96
00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.272
betterjoined together,
because we are in this position,

97
00:05:25.272 --> 00:05:30.231
where the test trace and isolate
isn’t working as it should,

98
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:35.481
the government spent a considerable
amount of money on it,

99
00:05:39.064 --> 00:05:41.939
but actually the figure out today
show that fewer contacts than ever

100
00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:42.981
are being tracked down.

101
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:45.356
People are waiting too long
to get test results back

102
00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:48.022
and until the government gets a grip
on the health crisis,

103
00:05:48.022 --> 00:05:49.439
the economyjust will not recover.

104
00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.814
Stephen, do you think Rishi Sunak
has waited too long and do you think

105
00:05:52.814 --> 00:05:54.231
what he is offering is enough?

106
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:57.147
So, I can remember starting OVO
Energy in 2009 and I remember,

107
00:05:57.147 --> 00:06:02.189
in the early days, I knew the names
of all my employees,

108
00:06:02.647 --> 00:06:04.814
I knew them personally,
moving quickly was really easy.

109
00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:07.272
We could make decisions,
we could react to competitors,

110
00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:10.522
we could react to customers really
quickly and something I have learned

111
00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:13.189
over the last ten years
is that the bigger the organisation

112
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.106
that you are running,
the longer it takes to make change

113
00:06:16.106 --> 00:06:20.439
and what we have seen in the last
couple of weeks, we have seen

114
00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.147
a very dynamic landscape,
the rate of infection has been

115
00:06:23.147 --> 00:06:28.189
unpredictable, it has been rising,
in many parts of the country,

116
00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:34.481
and I have a lot of sympathy
for civil servants and politicians

117
00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:37.897
who are having to react in real—time
to this and if you think

118
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:42.689
about something as complicated
as this employment scheme,

119
00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.856
and the furlough scheme
and everything, I look at this

120
00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:49.272
and I say, I have been very
impressed at how the machinery

121
00:06:49.272 --> 00:06:51.439
of government and I’m notjust
saying the government,

122
00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.022
but the machinery, has been able
to move so quickly,

123
00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:57.272
because the thing that we really
have to avoid is the kind

124
00:06:57.272 --> 00:07:02.272
of confusion that has come
from badly executed communication

125
00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:06.356
or inconsistent policy execution
and I think if it takes

126
00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:10.106
a little bit longer,
of course everyone wants it done

127
00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:12.189
yesterday, but if it takes
a little bit longer,

128
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:15.522
it takes a little bit longer,
and the problem is that we are going

129
00:07:15.522 --> 00:07:18.606
to face, they are going to last
for years and years and years.

130
00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:21.522
So, it feels very urgent
at the moment, but getting it right

131
00:07:21.522 --> 00:07:23.897
and making sure it is clearly
communicated, I think it’s

132
00:07:23.897 --> 00:07:28.356
going to be the most important thing
in making this successful.

133
00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:31.647
Joseph Stiglitz, do you think the UK
is getting it right when it comes

134
00:07:31.647 --> 00:07:33.814
to how the UK is handling
the economy and

135
00:07:33.814 --> 00:07:37.897
supporting businesses?

136
00:07:37.897 --> 00:07:41.189
Well, first let me say
that the delay in the UK has

137
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:46.147
been unconscionable,
the deficiencies in the programme

138
00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:52.147
were known for a while,
the course of the disease is not

139
00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:55.897
perfectly predictable,
but it was very clear

140
00:07:55.897 --> 00:07:59.397
that it was not under control,
so there was very clear

141
00:07:59.397 --> 00:08:04.356
that there was a need
for additional assistance.

142
00:08:05.897 --> 00:08:09.397
One does not get it perfect,
at any moment of time,

143
00:08:09.397 --> 00:08:14.439
so I agree with what has just been
said, this is a complicated issue,

144
00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:20.272
but the delay causes irreversible
damage and enormous anxiety.

145
00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:25.981
The one thing I can say about the UK
is that it is a model

146
00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:27.897
of good behaviour compared
to the United States.

147
00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:30.397
In what way in particular?

148
00:08:30.397 --> 00:08:34.939
If that is the basis of your
comparison, you’ve done well.

149
00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:38.231
And in what way in
particular do you mean?

150
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:43.272
Well, the United States
programmes ended inJune,

151
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:49.272
July and the Trump administration
has been unable to even come up

152
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:55.272
with an adequate programme,
the particular scheme that we had,

153
00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:02.022
was not as well—designed
as your initial furlough scheme,

154
00:09:02.022 --> 00:09:07.022
which was not the optimal design.

155
00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:10.481
One of the reasons that unemployment
in the United States has

156
00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:14.814
skyrocketed, is that we had
a deficient scheme in keeping

157
00:09:14.814 --> 00:09:17.981
workers affiliated with their firms.

158
00:09:17.981 --> 00:09:22.647
Our unemployment insurance scheme
was incapable of responding

159
00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:27.647
to the millions of people joining
the unemployment role

160
00:09:27.647 --> 00:09:31.272
and in the United States it is even
much more important than in the UK,

161
00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:35.772
because most Americans depend
on employers for their health

162
00:09:35.772 --> 00:09:39.106
insurance and the last thing
you want in the middle of a pandemic

163
00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:42.522
is to have no health insurance!

164
00:09:42.522 --> 00:09:45.522
So, you should appreciate
the National Health Service,

165
00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:49.647
even if you lose yourjob,
you still have the health insurance,

166
00:09:49.647 --> 00:09:52.439
in the United States these
people losing theirjobs,

167
00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:56.314
many of them do not
have health insurance.

168
00:09:56.314 --> 00:09:58.689
So, it was all the more
imperative to keep workers

169
00:09:58.689 --> 00:10:03.731
linked with their firms
and we failed miserably.

170
00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:08.981
I can go into all the reasons why it
failed, but it was a badly designed

171
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:12.106
programme, badly administered,
having the banks administer

172
00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:16.147
a small business programme,
you knew, it was predictable

173
00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:18.522
what they would do.

174
00:10:18.522 --> 00:10:21.772
They gave the money to those that
were better connected,

175
00:10:21.772 --> 00:10:24.439
which was not the most vulnerable
firms or them smallest firms

176
00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:29.439
or the firms most in need,
they gave it to those

177
00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.897
who had better connections.

178
00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:36.481
So, you know, as you look
around the world, I guess

179
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:39.397
I would say the UK has not done
as well as countries

180
00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:41.272
like New Zealand and many
other countries, but,

181
00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:44.647
on the other hand, you have done
a lot better than the United States.

182
00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:46.106
Anne.

183
00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:48.856
Well, it does feel very
kind of last minute,

184
00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:53.022
I think this evening there will be
people who will be much more

185
00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:56.856
confident about where they stand
than yesterday, but that also means

186
00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:59.231
that there are people and families
especially that had been

187
00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:03.564
through an awful lot over recent
weeks, not knowing what will come.

188
00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:06.564
Everyone who has been
on the furlough scheme has known it

189
00:11:06.564 --> 00:11:10.189
has come to an end at a certain
point and I think that has been

190
00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:13.272
a huge stress for people and also
a lot of people have gone

191
00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:18.231
on to the Universal Credit already,
we know 450,000 families have

192
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:20.397
and many also thought
that was where they

193
00:11:20.397 --> 00:11:25.356
were ending up, too.

194
00:11:25.356 --> 00:11:28.272
So, I think, clearly there has been
a lot happening at pace,

195
00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:31.189
but this is the long term,
we need to start now seeing

196
00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.647
what recovery plan do
we need to have in place,

197
00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:38.647
how can we support families to make
the best decisions for themselves?

198
00:11:38.814 --> 00:11:41.397
Obviously, I would say as well,
the growing number of children

199
00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:44.731
who are being put into poverty,
how do we get them out of poverty

200
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:49.772
and make sure no more extra come in?

201
00:11:50.314 --> 00:11:53.689
Well, quite a few hands have gone up
as we have been talking, Sarah.

202
00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:56.064
It really doesn’t help
with this sense of the North—

203
00:11:56.064 --> 00:11:58.439
south divide and real resentment,
I think, in the north,

204
00:11:58.439 --> 00:12:01.314
that this has just magically
happened in the wake that London has

205
00:12:01.314 --> 00:12:04.272
gone into Tier 2.

206
00:12:04.272 --> 00:12:06.231
David Owens.

207
00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:09.481
I can’t be the only person sitting
here wondering where on earth

208
00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:14.522
all this money has come from and how
inert it is going to be paid back.

209
00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:16.314
Yes.

210
00:12:16.314 --> 00:12:19.481
Eileen.

211
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:24.522
Compared to Spain, friends of mine
in Spain, and their businesses,

212
00:12:27.856 --> 00:12:29.981
they have just gone totally bust,
very lucrative business,

213
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:33.106
they got 20%, So in comparison,
we have done very well.

214
00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:35.272
Martin.

215
00:12:35.272 --> 00:12:38.397
Yeah, I just wonder if there
is a lack of insight in government

216
00:12:38.397 --> 00:12:39.606
into actually what is happening.

217
00:12:39.606 --> 00:12:42.272
For example, I am a schoolteacher
and I am obviously back

218
00:12:42.272 --> 00:12:45.856
at school, working full—time,
which is where I want to be,

219
00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:48.064
but for example, the source
of exceptional funding costs

220
00:12:48.064 --> 00:12:53.022
for helping schools with Covid ended
inJuly at now we have nothing,

221
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:57.272
we have no additionalfunds to pay
for cleaning or PPE.

222
00:12:57.272 --> 00:12:59.522
Do governments actually
have an insight into what is

223
00:12:59.522 --> 00:13:03.772
actually happening at a sort
of local level?

224
00:13:03.772 --> 00:13:05.356
Allen.

225
00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:09.897
I think they announced the changes
to the system nine days before

226
00:13:09.897 --> 00:13:13.064
the furlough system ends and that
has caused excess anxiety

227
00:13:13.064 --> 00:13:16.564
amongst everyone, really,
because no one could plan anything.

228
00:13:16.564 --> 00:13:20.564
All money is greatly appreciated,
don’t get me wrong, it’s just

229
00:13:20.564 --> 00:13:23.439
to actually announce that nine days
before the furlough system ends does

230
00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:25.647
not give people time
to adjust to make changes

231
00:13:25.647 --> 00:13:28.356
to their own finances.

232
00:13:28.356 --> 00:13:30.564
I mean, what you’re hearing,
Eileen makes the point

233
00:13:30.564 --> 00:13:33.439
that we are doing better than Spain,
for example, and Joseph says

234
00:13:33.439 --> 00:13:36.272
we are not as good as some
countries, but considerably worse

235
00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:39.356
than others, but you have got Sarah
talking about the north—south divide

236
00:13:39.356 --> 00:13:42.397
and Alan talking about very little
time to prepare and it comes back

237
00:13:42.397 --> 00:13:47.439
to Stephen’s question, could this
not have been done sooner?

238
00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:51.522
Well, I go back to the changes and
schemes which had been put in place.

239
00:13:51.522 --> 00:13:53.897
There was obviously
the announcement in September

240
00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:56.522
about the winter economy plan,
there were announcements inJuly

241
00:13:56.522 --> 00:14:00.814
about support forjobs
and encouraging employers to keep

242
00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:03.022
employees on and getting
an extra bonus inJanuary

243
00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:07.981
if that is what they have done.

244
00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:11.647
As I say, as Stephen said,
this is a fast—moving situation

245
00:14:11.647 --> 00:14:14.564
and actually it only becomes clear
and even then it is not

246
00:14:14.564 --> 00:14:15.897
completely clear...

247
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:19.022
What do you say to someone
like Sarah who says she finds it

248
00:14:19.022 --> 00:14:24.022
interesting that it is happening
just as London is about two

249
00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:27.814
or London is now in Tier 2
whereas in Sedgefield,

250
00:14:27.814 --> 00:14:29.731
for example, they have had
restrictions since mid—September!

251
00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:32.231
And yet the Chancellor has just
spoken about it today.

252
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:34.189
There have been restrictions
in Leicester and other

253
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:35.814
places as well and I...

254
00:14:35.814 --> 00:14:39.189
Look, I understand, I completely
understand the frustrations

255
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:41.564
and to answer the question
of the gentleman who said,

256
00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:44.689
do ministers and government
no, the answer is yes,

257
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:49.189
because all ministers are all pretty
much constituency MPs

258
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:52.356
and so they absolutely will be
looking at their inboxes,

259
00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:55.814
looking at their social media feeds,
going to constituencies,

260
00:14:55.814 --> 00:15:00.064
hearing what is happening
in people’s lives, but government

261
00:15:00.064 --> 00:15:04.481
of course has to have a balance
between all the different elements

262
00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:09.231
of the responses and listening
and trying to get that balance right

263
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:12.481
is obviously a huge task
and it continues to be so,

264
00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:15.397
because the situation continues
to develop all of the time

265
00:15:15.397 --> 00:15:18.564
and we see, for example,
which businesses, obviously have

266
00:15:18.564 --> 00:15:23.606
to remain closed and which are able
to open gradually and there is even

267
00:15:24.814 --> 00:15:29.814
a distinction between hospitality
and which can open and which can’t.

268
00:15:31.272 --> 00:15:34.147
I just really think that the whole
way this looks is one

269
00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:37.064
that is last—minute and it makes
people feel like they are living

270
00:15:37.064 --> 00:15:40.647
in a pinball machine, you know,
one week it is this way and one week

271
00:15:40.647 --> 00:15:41.689
it is that.

272
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:45.022
I don’t think it is deliberate
at all, Ijust think it is that

273
00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:47.439
difference between the fast pace
of change for people’s lives

274
00:15:47.439 --> 00:15:50.731
at the moment and then the machinery
of government and the speed it takes

275
00:15:50.731 --> 00:15:55.106
or lack of speed it
takes to make decisions.

276
00:15:55.106 --> 00:15:57.231
I think, really, what people
need here is mature,

277
00:15:57.231 --> 00:16:00.647
calm discussion, information,
ability to be able to plan

278
00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:04.106
themselves and also that feeling
of trust and what I am hearing here,

279
00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:08.731
actually, is whether it is
the north—south divide

280
00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:12.272
or whether it is looking at reasons
for late announcements,

281
00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:15.439
there is a need to build that trust
and I think that transparency

282
00:16:15.439 --> 00:16:16.939
is the way that is
going to be achieved.

283
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:22.981
I am going to move onto another
question, but before I do, Ijust

284
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:26.147
want to say that we are looking
for people to join our virtual

285
00:16:26.147 --> 00:16:27.189
audience next week.

286
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:32.189
We are going to be in Lincoln
and the week after that we will be

287
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:37.856
in Lewisham, in south—east London,
so if you live there or around that

288
00:16:37.856 --> 00:16:42.814
area, do get in touch,
go to the Question Time website

289
00:16:46.064 --> 00:16:49.356
and fill in the form there
and we will get in touch with you.

290
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:52.481
We would love to hear from you,
the audience is what makes this

291
00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:55.106
programme, so do get in touch
with us at the Question

292
00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:56.189
Time website.

293
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:58.856
Let’s take another question, talking
about our audience, from Susan Lowe.

294
00:16:58.856 --> 00:16:59.856
Hello.

295
00:16:59.856 --> 00:17:01.564
Andy Burnham’s stand
in Greater Manchester —

296
00:17:01.564 --> 00:17:04.189
is this a master class in how public
servants should exercise

297
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:05.231
representative democracy?

298
00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:06.647
And what do you think,
Susan?

299
00:17:06.647 --> 00:17:10.189
Well, I think he was clearly
listening to his population

300
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:15.231
in Greater Manchester,
which I am not sure is something

301
00:17:19.064 --> 00:17:22.606
that I feel the government is doing,
because I for one write to my MP

302
00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:25.272
on a regular basis and I am
constantly told various responses

303
00:17:25.272 --> 00:17:27.772
that the government is wanting
to put forward.

304
00:17:27.772 --> 00:17:31.231
What I don’t get is that human
feeling of what the person

305
00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:36.231
representing my constituency thinks.

306
00:17:42.522 --> 00:17:45.356
And also, when I think that
the government is using the whip

307
00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:48.022
all the time for votes
in Parliament, it is not achieving

308
00:17:48.022 --> 00:17:49.939
what we should be achieving,
in representing people

309
00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:50.981
of this country.

310
00:17:50.981 --> 00:17:53.189
Stephen, what did you make
of Andy Burnham’s stand

311
00:17:53.189 --> 00:17:55.314
in Greater Manchester,
standing up for his people or,

312
00:17:55.314 --> 00:18:00.022
as others have seen it,
dividing the country?

313
00:18:00.022 --> 00:18:04.689
So, I think, the situation
in Manchester was again changing

314
00:18:04.689 --> 00:18:09.231
very quickly and I think
Andy Burnham was absolutely right

315
00:18:09.231 --> 00:18:12.064
to try to drive for the best
possible deal for the people

316
00:18:12.064 --> 00:18:16.147
of Manchester, and represent
local population.

317
00:18:16.147 --> 00:18:20.731
I think that we look at the country
the size of the UK, it is made up,

318
00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:24.397
it is a very diverse nation
and I think there are lots of parts

319
00:18:24.397 --> 00:18:27.522
of our society that I feel are not
being represented or been listened

320
00:18:27.522 --> 00:18:31.314
to and when I think back
to the discussion we might have

321
00:18:31.314 --> 00:18:34.272
about the presidential debate
in the US and we look at politics

322
00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:37.856
in the US and look even in the UK
and see the Brexit debate

323
00:18:37.856 --> 00:18:42.814
that we had and how absolutely
tribal it became, it is really

324
00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:45.481
clear that we have fallen
into a situation where

325
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:48.814
we are simply not good at listening
to people that we do not agree

326
00:18:48.814 --> 00:18:51.981
with and come from a different tribe
and as someone who grew up

327
00:18:51.981 --> 00:18:54.564
in Northern Ireland in the 19805
and 19905, I have seen

328
00:18:54.564 --> 00:18:58.064
what happens when this really
deteriorates to the worst,

329
00:18:58.064 --> 00:19:00.981
it brings out the worst
in people and I think

330
00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:05.981
whether it is a north—south divide
or richer versus poorer,

331
00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.356
we have communities like the arts
feeling unrepresented,

332
00:19:10.356 --> 00:19:13.606
people who work in hospitality
feeling underrepresented and I look

333
00:19:13.606 --> 00:19:16.522
at where we have come from,
from March, when I remember really

334
00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:20.564
feeling a strong sense of national
unity and solidarity

335
00:19:20.564 --> 00:19:24.647
and that we were all in it together
and I look at how far we have come

336
00:19:24.647 --> 00:19:27.814
from that in just six months
and I think, it is really quite

337
00:19:27.814 --> 00:19:32.856
an important moment and I think
if we cannot figure out a way

338
00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:36.856
to come together, and be more
united, then it makes me very

339
00:19:36.856 --> 00:19:38.564
nervous for the future
of the country.

340
00:19:38.564 --> 00:19:41.939
I think, it is not impossible
that we start to get some good news

341
00:19:41.939 --> 00:19:46.647
and people start to feel more
connected, but I think more

342
00:19:46.647 --> 00:19:49.272
than anything, we need to see this
in our political leadership

343
00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:52.231
and when I think about the way
in which politics has become

344
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:56.689
so toxic and only looking
at the debate yesterday

345
00:19:56.689 --> 00:19:59.356
in the Houses of Parliament,
if we cannot get some grown—up,

346
00:19:59.356 --> 00:20:02.981
collegiate partnership
from our political leaders,

347
00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:06.356
it is no wonder that the country
feels like it is being torn apart.

348
00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:10.814
And so I for one would love
to see Borisjohnson,

349
00:20:10.814 --> 00:20:14.272
Andy Burnham, Nicola Sturgeon,
all of them working together in our

350
00:20:14.272 --> 00:20:19.272
interests and I say, coming again,
I am from Northern Ireland,

351
00:20:19.606 --> 00:20:22.231
if Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness
could figure out a way

352
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:24.397
to put their differences aside
and work together, then

353
00:20:24.397 --> 00:20:25.606
surely our leaders today can.

354
00:20:25.606 --> 00:20:30.522
And of course that is
what the Prime Minister has wanted

355
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:32.939
Keir Starmer to do repeatedly,
is to work with him

356
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:34.022
and work together.

357
00:20:34.022 --> 00:20:36.189
And throughout this,
we have sought to be constructive,

358
00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:39.522
but of course we have to give voice,
when we have got real concerns

359
00:20:39.522 --> 00:20:41.939
around how the government
are handling this and I think

360
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:45.064
Andy Burnham has done an amazing job
in standing up for the people

361
00:20:45.064 --> 00:20:47.689
he represents and the same is true
for local government leaders

362
00:20:47.689 --> 00:20:48.731
right across our country.

363
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.647
I think the disrespectful,
contemptuous way the government

364
00:20:50.647 --> 00:20:53.272
has treated, notjust
Greater Manchester, but large parts

365
00:20:53.272 --> 00:20:57.356
of the north of England, Ifind it
worrying and really serious.

366
00:20:57.356 --> 00:20:59.981
In the north—east, we have had
additional restrictions now

367
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.647
for well over a month,
even longer in other

368
00:21:02.647 --> 00:21:03.897
parts of the North.

369
00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:06.731
Hang on, because Labour are calling
for a national lockdown,

370
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:09.231
so presumably you’re not objecting
to the restrictions,

371
00:21:09.231 --> 00:21:12.689
I know you want more funding
for those restrictions,

372
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:16.064
but since we are talking about that,
how long would you like a national

373
00:21:16.064 --> 00:21:17.189
lockdown to go on for?

374
00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:20.272
We supported the introduction
of local restrictions,

375
00:21:20.272 --> 00:21:23.231
but what has not come alongside
that is any consistency or clarity

376
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:26.064
around the funding that goes
with it, so we have had meetings

377
00:21:26.064 --> 00:21:29.939
with ministers, as have council
leaders, we cannot get any answers

378
00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:32.814
around what we can expect for this
formula they apparently used to

379
00:21:32.814 --> 00:21:34.231
determine the funding for each area.

380
00:21:34.231 --> 00:21:36.939
Just be clear, if you did get
the funding required,

381
00:21:36.939 --> 00:21:39.981
how long do you think
the lockdown should continue?

382
00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:42.856
Or how long do you think it should
be, because it obviously

383
00:21:42.856 --> 00:21:43.939
has not started yet?

384
00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:47.064
As we have set out, we think
there should be a circuit break

385
00:21:47.064 --> 00:21:50.231
to reset where we are,
this is the right time to do this,

386
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:51.189
going into half term...

387
00:21:51.189 --> 00:21:52.231
For how long?

388
00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:54.606
For two to three weeks,
so the government have got

389
00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:57.022
a chance to sort out test,
trace and isolate, it

390
00:21:57.022 --> 00:21:58.064
just is not working.

391
00:21:58.064 --> 00:22:00.689
We were promised a world heating
system and we have got

392
00:22:00.689 --> 00:22:02.897
a barely functional system.

393
00:22:02.897 --> 00:22:07.939
Until that gets sorted out,
we are going to be in a situation

394
00:22:08.481 --> 00:22:10.647
where we will face rolling
lockdowns in regions right

395
00:22:10.647 --> 00:22:13.981
across the country and I know,
from many of the people that I speak

396
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:15.897
to in my constituency,
workers and businesses alike,

397
00:22:15.897 --> 00:22:18.564
they just want to know
that there will be an end

398
00:22:18.564 --> 00:22:19.981
in sight to all of this.

399
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:22.647
They have made enormous sacrifices
to get us to this point,

400
00:22:22.647 --> 00:22:25.481
but this sense, I think
it is a growing sense of anger

401
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:28.856
and alarm about how the government
is handling this and can we ever get

402
00:22:28.856 --> 00:22:32.231
to the point where we start to
emerge and come out the other side?

403
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:33.897
Louis, you have got your hand up.

404
00:22:33.897 --> 00:22:34.939
Yeah.

405
00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:36.022
Thank you, Fiona.

406
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:38.189
You talk about a two
to three—week circuit breaker,

407
00:22:38.189 --> 00:22:40.522
a circuit breaker is just a fancy
language for lockdown.

408
00:22:40.522 --> 00:22:43.397
We had a three—week circuit breaker
in March, we are now seven

409
00:22:43.397 --> 00:22:46.272
or eight months into it,
so what on earth are we going

410
00:22:46.272 --> 00:22:49.397
to achieve in two to three weeks
that we haven’t achieved in seven

411
00:22:49.397 --> 00:22:52.106
to eight months, there is no
guarantee that it will end

412
00:22:52.106 --> 00:22:54.939
in two to three weeks,
we could be in exactly the same

413
00:22:54.939 --> 00:22:56.356
position, just at a later date.

414
00:22:56.356 --> 00:22:59.231
We aren’t dealing with the problem,
we are just pushing it further

415
00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:00.439
and further down the line.

416
00:23:00.439 --> 00:23:02.356
Do you want to quickly
respond to that?

417
00:23:02.356 --> 00:23:04.356
The government has lost
control of the virus,

418
00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:05.772
we are not in a position...

419
00:23:05.772 --> 00:23:06.856
Respond to his question.

420
00:23:06.856 --> 00:23:08.022
Never mind about the government.

421
00:23:08.022 --> 00:23:09.814
What about the point
that Louis made?

422
00:23:09.814 --> 00:23:12.397
That is why we are calling
for a national circuit breaker,

423
00:23:12.397 --> 00:23:15.064
until we get into a position
where the government has got

424
00:23:15.064 --> 00:23:16.147
control of the virus.

425
00:23:16.147 --> 00:23:18.731
He is asking what difference do
you think it would make?

426
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:21.606
It would allow the government,
it would allow us to dampen down

427
00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:23.272
the infection rates,
which are rising right

428
00:23:23.272 --> 00:23:26.231
across the country, notjust
in areas that are subject to local

429
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:28.606
restrictions, it would allow
the government to get a grip

430
00:23:28.606 --> 00:23:29.772
on test, trace and isolate.

431
00:23:29.772 --> 00:23:30.981
In two to three weeks?

432
00:23:30.981 --> 00:23:34.356
Do you think they would actually get
test, trace and isolate to be world

433
00:23:34.356 --> 00:23:35.772
beating in two to three weeks?

434
00:23:35.772 --> 00:23:37.939
There are immediate changes
that the government could make

435
00:23:37.939 --> 00:23:40.356
to get the system working better,
to give greater powers

436
00:23:40.356 --> 00:23:42.522
to local councils, to run
some of that system,

437
00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:45.606
who are much better connected
to what is going on than the current

438
00:23:45.606 --> 00:23:48.272
kind of privatised model
that we have got at the moment,

439
00:23:48.272 --> 00:23:51.189
that involves giving a very large
sums of money to private consultants

440
00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:54.272
at a point where actually
we could do that much better if that

441
00:23:54.272 --> 00:23:55.439
were devolved to local communities.

442
00:23:55.439 --> 00:23:59.064
Jack, you have had your hand up
for a while, let us hearfrom you.

443
00:23:59.064 --> 00:24:01.689
I have, because my husband
is volunteering on Test and Trace

444
00:24:01.689 --> 00:24:04.856
and I would just like to point out
that although I do feel

445
00:24:04.856 --> 00:24:07.856
that the government could build
a better system to manage that,

446
00:24:07.856 --> 00:24:12.856
it will not mitigate for people not
picking up the phone and it will not

447
00:24:14.689 --> 00:24:19.064
mitigate against people
who are unprepared to share details

448
00:24:19.064 --> 00:24:23.022
to help trace people.

449
00:24:23.022 --> 00:24:25.647
Eileen, you have had
your hand up as well.

450
00:24:25.647 --> 00:24:28.397
I think that the opposition
arejust basically going

451
00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:33.272
against the government all the time,
regardless of what it is,

452
00:24:33.272 --> 00:24:36.147
it doesn’t matter what it was,
they will always go the opposite

453
00:24:36.147 --> 00:24:38.522
and they have never,
ever come up with a solution,

454
00:24:38.522 --> 00:24:41.731
a viable solution, to prove
anything at all.

455
00:24:41.731 --> 00:24:46.689
So, Ijust think Boris has
done marvellous myself.

456
00:24:46.981 --> 00:24:51.314
And my family...

457
00:24:51.314 --> 00:24:53.064
You are cheering up Nicky
enormously, Eileen!

458
00:24:53.064 --> 00:24:54.772
Nikki is looking veryjolly at that.

459
00:24:54.772 --> 00:24:56.231
I love that.

460
00:24:56.231 --> 00:24:59.772
I do, I think he has done
a marvellousjob, I really do.

461
00:24:59.772 --> 00:25:04.689
I despair if Labour were in charge,
for all of us, I think.

462
00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:09.106
You have got your work
cut out there, I think,

463
00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:11.981
Bridget, to persuade Eileen.

464
00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:17.022
Joseph, I mean the question
is about Andy Vernon has Michael

465
00:25:20.981 --> 00:25:22.189
—— Burnham standing
Greater Manchester,

466
00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:23.897
I don’t know how closely
you have

467
00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:26.064
been following that over
in the States, but obviously

468
00:25:26.064 --> 00:25:28.397
it is in part about local
politicians taking a stand

469
00:25:28.397 --> 00:25:29.439
against the national government.

470
00:25:29.439 --> 00:25:34.481
Well, I think there is a lot
of truth in the circumstances

471
00:25:39.397 --> 00:25:41.397
in different locations
are markedly different,

472
00:25:41.397 --> 00:25:44.481
but there is a need for national
leadership and it is clear that

473
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:49.522
in the initial phases of Covid—19,
in both the UK and the US,

474
00:25:50.647 --> 00:25:53.064
the national leadership was not
doing what it should —

475
00:25:53.064 --> 00:25:55.231
the idea of herd immunity,
which was pushed, was

476
00:25:55.231 --> 00:25:58.522
an absurd idea.

477
00:25:58.522 --> 00:26:01.606
The good thing is that
you have done a lot better

478
00:26:01.606 --> 00:26:04.231
than the United States subsequently.

479
00:26:04.231 --> 00:26:09.231
Our national leadership still has
not come to terms with the problem,

480
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:16.939
but the notion, at the core
of the problem, is developing

481
00:26:19.314 --> 00:26:23.106
social solidarity,
that was what was pointed out

482
00:26:23.106 --> 00:26:27.772
before, and when you have leadership
that is not developing that kind

483
00:26:27.772 --> 00:26:32.731
of trust and social solidarity,
you’re going to have a much poorer

484
00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:37.106
response to the pandemic
and that is why countries

485
00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:42.022
where there is a lot
of social solidarity,

486
00:26:42.022 --> 00:26:44.564
leadership that exhibits that social
solidarity, countries

487
00:26:44.564 --> 00:26:47.481
like New Zealand and South Korea,
have done a lot better.

488
00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:50.397
Both in terms of the pandemic
and in terms of the economic

489
00:26:50.397 --> 00:26:55.356
response, so it seems to me that,
as I look across the Atlantic,

490
00:26:57.856 --> 00:27:02.897
I see a big failure in the national
leadership in the UK and a better

491
00:27:10.022 --> 00:27:12.939
national leadership would try
to enhance that solidarity

492
00:27:12.939 --> 00:27:15.522
and recognise that there is both
a need for national leadership,

493
00:27:15.522 --> 00:27:18.231
but also for local and
regional leadership.

494
00:27:18.231 --> 00:27:19.814
Lesley.

495
00:27:19.814 --> 00:27:24.647
Hello, Ifeel there is a real
disconnect between national

496
00:27:24.647 --> 00:27:29.647
leadership and the local leadership
and when there is research coming

497
00:27:30.189 --> 00:27:35.231
out that says that children in large
numbers in the north—east and towns

498
00:27:36.897 --> 00:27:41.272
are living in poverty,
so 33% in Sedgefield,

499
00:27:41.272 --> 00:27:45.397
A1% in Middlesbrough,
for instance, you know,

500
00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:50.231
we need somebody at local level
to take the issue to the leadership

501
00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:55.231
and I think after yesterday’s
debate, I did not see that

502
00:27:55.897 --> 00:27:59.522
leadership at a national level.

503
00:27:59.522 --> 00:28:02.689
Does that concern you, Nicky?

504
00:28:02.689 --> 00:28:07.689
What, this issue...

505
00:28:08.022 --> 00:28:09.647
Not seeing leadership
at a national level,

506
00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:11.314
hearing whatJoseph was saying.

507
00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:14.189
I don’t agree with that
and of course we have also heard

508
00:28:14.189 --> 00:28:17.397
from Eileen about her enthusiasm
for the leadership of Boris,

509
00:28:17.397 --> 00:28:22.397
so I think, I am sitting on a House
of Lords committee at the moment,

510
00:28:23.897 --> 00:28:26.522
called Life Beyond Covid and imagine
there is such a thing,

511
00:28:26.522 --> 00:28:29.397
we are going to get there eventually
and we will get there,

512
00:28:29.397 --> 00:28:31.314
we absolutely will,
because that is the history

513
00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:36.314
of pandemics through the years,
but we obviously do not know how

514
00:28:37.814 --> 00:28:40.439
and when and actually people’s
experiences of this year are very

515
00:28:40.439 --> 00:28:42.606
much conditioned or peoples views
are very much conditioned

516
00:28:42.606 --> 00:28:44.981
by their own experiences and Steve
was right to mention,

517
00:28:44.981 --> 00:28:47.397
people are now not divided
by Brexit, they are divided

518
00:28:47.397 --> 00:28:48.606
about their view on lockdown.

519
00:28:48.606 --> 00:28:50.772
Some people feel very strongly that
another national lockdown

520
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:53.397
is the right thing to do,
I totally disagree with that

521
00:28:53.397 --> 00:28:57.606
and other people feel it has to be
very much regional and to the point

522
00:28:57.606 --> 00:29:00.731
that Lesley has just made and I am
sure that Anne will have

523
00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:03.356
something to say about that,
given her role, the great sadness

524
00:29:03.356 --> 00:29:06.272
is that we have spent three years
talking about Brexit and just

525
00:29:06.272 --> 00:29:09.147
at the time that the country
was hopefully going to be able

526
00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:11.272
to move forward and tackle
children’s outcomes, social care,

527
00:29:11.272 --> 00:29:14.397
we are now obviously all of us
having to deal with this virus,

528
00:29:14.397 --> 00:29:16.356
I think there is far
more social solidarity

529
00:29:16.356 --> 00:29:17.897
than actually people realise.

530
00:29:17.897 --> 00:29:20.564
You know, I obviously live
in the Midlands and communities

531
00:29:20.564 --> 00:29:23.064
are still very much helping
each other out.

532
00:29:23.064 --> 00:29:25.731
There was a headline today
in the Times saying that actually

533
00:29:25.731 --> 00:29:27.856
young people are taking
the responsibility of social

534
00:29:27.856 --> 00:29:30.314
distancing seriously
and that it is beginning to bring

535
00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:33.606
the numbers down and that is
what we are going to see,

536
00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:38.606
throughout this period obviously
of the virus, and in terms of where

537
00:29:38.856 --> 00:29:42.564
we started on this question,
which was about regional leadership,

538
00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:45.272
for disclosure, lam married
to a local authority leader,

539
00:29:45.272 --> 00:29:50.272
I am watching him and his colleagues
obviously debating with ministers

540
00:29:50.481 --> 00:29:53.106
and others about restrictions
on what is going to happen

541
00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:57.064
and everything else and I think that
what is right is that regional local

542
00:29:57.064 --> 00:29:58.689
authority leaders and national
leadership obviously

543
00:29:58.689 --> 00:30:00.564
have to work together.

544
00:30:00.564 --> 00:30:02.522
It is very difficult,
because national leadership

545
00:30:02.522 --> 00:30:06.522
will often be able to see things
that pitch up across the country

546
00:30:06.522 --> 00:30:10.272
in a way that inevitably regional
and local authorityjust cannot

547
00:30:10.272 --> 00:30:13.189
and will not and they shouldn’t,
because they are there to stand

548
00:30:13.189 --> 00:30:15.564
up for a local area,
but where we started with

549
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:20.314
the question about Andy Burnham,
my worry about the way that he has

550
00:30:20.314 --> 00:30:23.481
conducted things is that somehow
to say that is right is to say

551
00:30:23.481 --> 00:30:26.314
that those people like DanJarvis
and Joe Anderson and Steve Rotherham

552
00:30:26.314 --> 00:30:30.147
in Merseyside, who have
not behaved like that,

553
00:30:30.147 --> 00:30:32.522
have not done right
by their communities and I don’t

554
00:30:32.522 --> 00:30:33.981
think that is right at all.

555
00:30:33.981 --> 00:30:36.856
I think everyone has to approach
this differently and it is quite

556
00:30:36.856 --> 00:30:41.522
right that we are going to see
and I think we should see

557
00:30:41.522 --> 00:30:43.689
rolling, regional lockdowns
if that is what is needed,

558
00:30:43.689 --> 00:30:46.356
because it would not be right,
the Prime Minister was absolutely

559
00:30:46.356 --> 00:30:49.439
right, we have to keep the economy
moving, as much as we can,

560
00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:51.606
in certain areas of the country,
whilst accepting that,

561
00:30:51.606 --> 00:30:54.981
sadly, until we are through this,
the way we want to live our lives

562
00:30:54.981 --> 00:30:58.397
is going to be curtailed.

563
00:30:58.397 --> 00:31:00.897
Anne, question —
was what Andy Burnham did

564
00:31:00.897 --> 00:31:02.564
this week a masterclass
in local democracy?

565
00:31:02.564 --> 00:31:04.981
So, what I think is happening
is that actually local

566
00:31:04.981 --> 00:31:07.897
and national leaders,
and I am a fan of the new mayors

567
00:31:07.897 --> 00:31:10.981
are having to find out a new way
to work together that actually

568
00:31:10.981 --> 00:31:12.064
can be constructive.

569
00:31:12.064 --> 00:31:15.606
It is new, people are not used to it
and actually it is working more

570
00:31:15.606 --> 00:31:18.272
or less and Andy was absolutely
right to represent the real

571
00:31:18.272 --> 00:31:23.231
need of those people
in Manchester and the like,

572
00:31:26.147 --> 00:31:31.147
but clearly it fell into a place
where actually all the airways

573
00:31:33.231 --> 00:31:38.231
were full of the unpleasant
and seemingly unsympathetic way

574
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:42.647
that the talks came to an end,
now what I would say

575
00:31:42.647 --> 00:31:44.564
about that was actually,
the more the airwaves

576
00:31:44.564 --> 00:31:47.231
are filled with that,
the less time there is to look

577
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:49.897
at the real problems,
which I am hearing from the people

578
00:31:49.897 --> 00:31:52.064
asking the questions here,
which is actually child poverty

579
00:31:52.064 --> 00:31:53.939
is rising, especially
in the north—east, how actually

580
00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:57.272
families are going to find their way
forward, what comes next and how can

581
00:31:57.272 --> 00:31:59.481
people feel that level
of trust in their leaders,

582
00:31:59.481 --> 00:32:02.231
both nationally and locally?

583
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:05.272
I think, again, we need to have that
real confidence in our leaders,

584
00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:08.231
be they nationally or locally,
having that grown—up debate.

585
00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:13.064
And if it does fall into
point—scoring at all, really, and

586
00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:15.856
not saying that anyone is at this
point, then that is absolutely

587
00:32:15.856 --> 00:32:16.939
missing the point.

588
00:32:16.939 --> 00:32:20.022
Matthew.

589
00:32:20.022 --> 00:32:22.147
I honestlyjust wish
that the north—east had

590
00:32:22.147 --> 00:32:25.106
someone like Andy Burnham,
because we have been facing

591
00:32:25.106 --> 00:32:29.106
these similar Tier 2 restrictions
for so long now and we have not

592
00:32:29.106 --> 00:32:32.397
really had anyone to step up
to the plate and fight our corner

593
00:32:32.397 --> 00:32:35.481
for us and we have watched
many of our

594
00:32:35.481 --> 00:32:39.356
local businesses just go unheard,
close shop and the announcement

595
00:32:39.356 --> 00:32:44.397
today from the Chancellor has just
come too late for our region and it

596
00:32:44.814 --> 00:32:47.231
is really disappointing,
to be honest.

597
00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:50.481
Let us take another
question from Sarah.

598
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:53.981
Is it now the case that Premiership
footballers care more about children

599
00:32:53.981 --> 00:32:57.439
going hungry than most MPs?

600
00:32:57.439 --> 00:33:00.564
So this, of course, is a reference
to Marcus Rashford and his campaign

601
00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:04.939
to get free school meals throughout
the holidays and Labour have

602
00:33:04.939 --> 00:33:08.231
supported the idea throughout
the holidays until Easter.

603
00:33:08.231 --> 00:33:11.522
I mean, Anne, obviously I am going
to come to you first as children’s

604
00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.564
Commissioner for England.

605
00:33:12.564 --> 00:33:16.689
Well, certainly Marcus Rashford,
young guy, 22, really talented

606
00:33:16.689 --> 00:33:19.314
individual and footballer,
has rocketed this

607
00:33:19.314 --> 00:33:22.231
issue centre stage.

608
00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:25.147
It is something that people have
campaigned forfor a long time,

609
00:33:25.147 --> 00:33:27.272
but he brings that personal
experience and, you know,

610
00:33:27.272 --> 00:33:30.231
what he is able to do is say,
look, for these kids,

611
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:32.814
life is limited in every way.

612
00:33:32.814 --> 00:33:37.856
You know, I cannot forget the first
time I went into a secondary school

613
00:33:41.814 --> 00:33:44.231
and saw food banks and saw washing
machines, actually there

614
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:45.564
to watch the kids clothes.

615
00:33:45.564 --> 00:33:48.689
That is the reality for a growing
number of children and one which,

616
00:33:48.689 --> 00:33:51.814
you know, the accusation last night
was that it was a sticking plaster,

617
00:33:51.814 --> 00:33:54.897
it may not be the full answer,
but actually we need a long—term

618
00:33:54.897 --> 00:33:58.064
plan and until we have it,
the bottom line surely has to be

619
00:33:58.064 --> 00:34:03.106
that children get the help they need
to not go hungry.

620
00:34:03.522 --> 00:34:06.314
I remain absolutely astonished
that we are still having

621
00:34:06.314 --> 00:34:11.314
this debate, it is 2020,
you know, a wealthy country,

622
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:15.897
it has the air of Dickensian
about it and I actually think that

623
00:34:15.897 --> 00:34:20.814
people do want to do their best
for kids and we have done that,

624
00:34:20.814 --> 00:34:23.231
the government has been bold
and generous in providing free

625
00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:26.106
school meals over recent months
and to continue that,

626
00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:28.772
while we are in the midst
of a crisis and pandemic,

627
00:34:28.772 --> 00:34:30.481
to me sounds basic.

628
00:34:30.481 --> 00:34:33.147
What do you make of comments,
for example, from one Tory

629
00:34:33.147 --> 00:34:36.439
MP during the debate,
where is the slick PR campaigning

630
00:34:36.439 --> 00:34:38.147
encouraging absent parents
to take some responsibility

631
00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:40.106
for their children?

632
00:34:40.106 --> 00:34:45.064
I don’t believe in
nationalising children.

633
00:34:45.439 --> 00:34:47.772
There is always the debate that
if you have children,

634
00:34:47.772 --> 00:34:50.939
you should look after them,
kind of a bit like pets, but again,

635
00:34:50.939 --> 00:34:52.647
I thought we had moved beyond that.

636
00:34:52.647 --> 00:34:55.314
Of course families want to look
after their kids, of course

637
00:34:55.314 --> 00:34:58.397
they want to provide for them,
but we know that reality is that

638
00:34:58.397 --> 00:35:01.814
kids often do not have
food in the cupboards.

639
00:35:01.814 --> 00:35:04.647
I had a group of Newsround kids
come round to see me,

640
00:35:04.647 --> 00:35:06.814
really bright individuals,
but they told me they will

641
00:35:06.814 --> 00:35:09.814
go home and not know
what was in the cupboards

642
00:35:09.814 --> 00:35:12.439
and for a lot of us,
that is difficult to imagine

643
00:35:12.439 --> 00:35:14.856
what that means, but it takes away
all your confidence,

644
00:35:14.856 --> 00:35:18.272
all your self—belief
and all your ability,

645
00:35:18.272 --> 00:35:21.481
actually, that the future is going
to have any promise for you.

646
00:35:21.481 --> 00:35:23.689
Ithink, you know,
we are in the middle

647
00:35:23.689 --> 00:35:26.439
of the pandemic, still,
we are at crisis point,

648
00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:30.814
there is a growing number
of children who are in poverty,

649
00:35:30.814 --> 00:35:34.272
that is not going away,
it needs a serious plan,

650
00:35:34.272 --> 00:35:36.481
and I want government
and I would say this,

651
00:35:36.481 --> 00:35:39.939
whatever government was there,
actually to see it as their mission

652
00:35:39.939 --> 00:35:44.939
that they reduce poverty and food
poverty, it is something

653
00:35:47.439 --> 00:35:52.481
that governments can do,
we had seen pensioner

654
00:35:56.397 --> 00:35:57.647
poverty reduced
drastically over recent

655
00:35:57.647 --> 00:36:00.731
years, but really the focus has
to be, because if we are going

656
00:36:00.731 --> 00:36:03.356
to level up and if anyone
in the north—east, everyone wants

657
00:36:03.356 --> 00:36:06.022
the north—east to succeed,
but actually people have to be able

658
00:36:06.022 --> 00:36:09.564
to know that they are going to be
able to be financially viable to do

659
00:36:09.564 --> 00:36:12.731
that and kids need to know
that they are going to be able

660
00:36:12.731 --> 00:36:13.772
to succeed and thrive.

661
00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:16.356
Martin, you are a teacher of course,
what is your perspective?

662
00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:19.272
One of the basic rights of a child,
according to the UN,

663
00:36:19.272 --> 00:36:21.939
is the right to nutritious food,
and I think the comments

664
00:36:21.939 --> 00:36:24.272
in Parliament, for example,
it is really important to remember

665
00:36:24.272 --> 00:36:27.231
that poverty is not a choice,
it is not a lifestyle choice,

666
00:36:27.231 --> 00:36:31.564
and children have the right
to nutritious food and I think,

667
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:36.522
really, the government need
to understand that and actually,

668
00:36:44.606 --> 00:36:47.231
if they can fund eat out
to help out, then surely

669
00:36:47.231 --> 00:36:48.314
they can fund something

670
00:36:48.314 --> 00:36:49.981
that would prevent children
from going hungry.

671
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:51.064
David.

672
00:36:51.064 --> 00:36:53.397
Ijust find it hypocritical
that they voted against extending

673
00:36:53.397 --> 00:36:55.689
the free school meals and yet
they voted themselves

674
00:36:55.689 --> 00:36:58.606
a £3000 plus pay rise.

675
00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:01.022
Well, they didn’t vote
for themselves, it is an independent

676
00:37:01.022 --> 00:37:03.189
committee, I have got that right,
haven’t I, Nicky?

677
00:37:03.189 --> 00:37:04.231
That’s right.

678
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:05.231
That does that.

679
00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:06.439
But, I hear your point.

680
00:37:06.439 --> 00:37:07.481
Stephen.

681
00:37:07.481 --> 00:37:10.606
What did you make of the debate
and the campaign of Marcus Rashford?

682
00:37:10.606 --> 00:37:13.022
First of all, I think
Marcus Rashford, what an inspiring

683
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:17.189
young man and I have to say,
it is really impressive,

684
00:37:17.189 --> 00:37:20.981
we were used to other kinds
of headlines about footballers,

685
00:37:20.981 --> 00:37:25.231
but to see this young man be such
a role model and really inspiring

686
00:37:25.231 --> 00:37:29.564
in his courage and bravery to stand
up for something he really

687
00:37:29.564 --> 00:37:33.481
believes in and I think...

688
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:38.481
Do you think the government
was right to oppose the motion?

689
00:37:38.564 --> 00:37:41.231
We had a brief discussion,
it came up in the previous

690
00:37:41.231 --> 00:37:43.606
question, about trust
and it was about the social cohesion

691
00:37:43.606 --> 00:37:46.231
and trust in the government
and we have seen countries around

692
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:48.189
the world that have done
well with coronavirus,

693
00:37:48.189 --> 00:37:51.856
the Covid—19 response,
that have both trusted in the people

694
00:37:51.856 --> 00:37:56.814
and have the trust of the people
and if you look at Jacinda Ardern’s

695
00:37:56.814 --> 00:37:59.814
election win in New Zealand,
it has been described as an example

696
00:37:59.814 --> 00:38:02.897
of compassionate competence,
in different kind

697
00:38:02.897 --> 00:38:05.356
of democratic area.

698
00:38:05.356 --> 00:38:07.522
I still don’t know whether you
think the government

699
00:38:07.522 --> 00:38:08.564
should have done this?

700
00:38:08.564 --> 00:38:10.022
It is an absolute own goal.

701
00:38:10.022 --> 00:38:11.064
So, they should have.

702
00:38:11.064 --> 00:38:14.064
Ijust don’t understand how it is,
even if they don’t believe

703
00:38:14.064 --> 00:38:16.689
the detail of this thing,
that they can vote against money

704
00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:19.522
for children, and I think one
of the things we are seen

705
00:38:19.522 --> 00:38:22.231
with Covid—19 is that it is
exacerbating and making worse social

706
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:26.231
divides that we already have
in this country.

707
00:38:26.231 --> 00:38:31.231
We have a huge problem
with inequality, OVO Energy,

708
00:38:31.689 --> 00:38:33.981
has a foundation, one
of our investment themes

709
00:38:33.981 --> 00:38:36.481
early years education,
and there is such a dramatic

710
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:41.481
problem with the fact that
in the 21st century,

711
00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:45.481
children that grow up in Britain,
their economic success

712
00:38:45.481 --> 00:38:46.689
in life is already mostly

713
00:38:46.689 --> 00:38:49.564
predictable by the age of five
and we just need dramatically more

714
00:38:49.564 --> 00:38:53.231
investment in children,
in education and free school meals

715
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:55.731
for children on school holidays
is just so obviously

716
00:38:55.731 --> 00:38:59.772
an opportunity for the government
to show some compassion.

717
00:38:59.772 --> 00:39:02.481
Bridget.

718
00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:05.564
I mean, it is just inexplicable that
in the middle of this terrible

719
00:39:05.564 --> 00:39:08.231
pandemic, as we come into a really
difficult winterfor lots

720
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:10.356
of families, that the government
will not support this.

721
00:39:10.356 --> 00:39:13.189
I think Marcus Rashford has
done an incrediblejob,

722
00:39:13.189 --> 00:39:15.856
as someone who himself was once poor
and hungry, speaking up

723
00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:19.189
for vulnerable children who do not
have a voice and to make sure that

724
00:39:19.189 --> 00:39:21.564
no child goes hungry this Christmas.

725
00:39:21.564 --> 00:39:24.064
We are such a wealthy country
with a great opportunity

726
00:39:24.064 --> 00:39:27.564
and it is a scar on our country that
so many children grow up

727
00:39:27.564 --> 00:39:31.606
in poverty, avoidable poverty.

728
00:39:31.606 --> 00:39:33.981
The government could step in,
notjust in this area,

729
00:39:33.981 --> 00:39:38.481
but I think this is one aspect
of what we have seen is a growing

730
00:39:38.481 --> 00:39:43.439
trend in recent years,
where more and more children,

731
00:39:46.981 --> 00:39:48.856
including those in families
where there is work,

732
00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:51.981
are finding that the money just
is not there and it does not

733
00:39:51.981 --> 00:39:54.356
stretch, and that is putting
families in an impossible situation.

734
00:39:54.356 --> 00:39:57.981
When I grew up, as someone who spent
part of my childhood on free school

735
00:39:57.981 --> 00:40:01.147
meals in a single—parent family,
I was lucky, lots of the other kids

736
00:40:01.147 --> 00:40:04.439
that I grew up with, were not
so lucky and were not so fortunate.

737
00:40:04.439 --> 00:40:07.147
I thought this country,
we could put those days behind us,

738
00:40:07.147 --> 00:40:10.231
but we are going backwards and it
breaks my heart to see kids

739
00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:12.856
in my communityjust going hungry
in the midst of this

740
00:40:12.856 --> 00:40:13.939
terrible, terrible crisis.

741
00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:14.981
Joseph.

742
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:17.064
Well, I find this debate
actually amazing.

743
00:40:17.064 --> 00:40:20.897
I do find what the government
did unconscionable.

744
00:40:20.897 --> 00:40:25.939
In New York City, when we close
the schools in the lockdown,

745
00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:31.106
one thing we kept was the school
lunch programmes, people could go

746
00:40:31.106 --> 00:40:34.564
to the schools and get
the lunches that they would

747
00:40:34.564 --> 00:40:36.856
have otherwise gotten.

748
00:40:36.856 --> 00:40:41.314
A lot of careful social
distancing and all that,

749
00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:46.356
but the fact that a child who does
not get food can be scarred for life

750
00:40:46.689 --> 00:40:51.731
and obviously cannot learn
in the way that they should.

751
00:40:54.606 --> 00:40:58.647
So, as everyone has been saying,
as a basic human right,

752
00:40:58.647 --> 00:41:03.606
they are a child, the child
is a person, you are talking

753
00:41:03.606 --> 00:41:08.564
about the future of the UK
and the fact that you’re not

754
00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:15.606
in the era of Charles Dickens now,
you are in the 21st century,

755
00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:20.564
that you would be having this debate
about whether children should have

756
00:41:21.272 --> 00:41:25.147
adequate nutrition, Ifind
that quite unbelievable.

757
00:41:25.147 --> 00:41:28.272
I mean Nicky, you supported
legislation that will give

758
00:41:28.272 --> 00:41:30.647
the poorest children free school
meals over the holidays back

759
00:41:30.647 --> 00:41:35.231
in 2017, is this a good
look for the government?

760
00:41:35.231 --> 00:41:38.647
Well, I think the Labour Party might
have found it would have got more

761
00:41:38.647 --> 00:41:43.647
supporters yesterday if the deputy
Labour leader had not called one

762
00:41:46.939 --> 00:41:50.189
of the Conservative MPs scum
in the course of the debate.

763
00:41:50.189 --> 00:41:51.564
I have to say yesterday’s debate...

764
00:41:51.564 --> 00:41:54.231
I don’t think anyone is defending
that, but that is not

765
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:55.397
exactly the point, is it?

766
00:41:55.397 --> 00:41:58.814
The point is, if you want to build
a Coalition, we have heard comments

767
00:41:58.814 --> 00:42:00.981
saying it is unconscionable
that the government did not

768
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:02.397
support this, well,

769
00:42:02.397 --> 00:42:03.814
1.
II

770
00:42:03.814 --> 00:42:05.439
If the Labour Party had wanted an

771
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:05.897
If the labour Party had wanted an
Marcus

772
00:42:05.897 --> 00:42:06.814
If the Labour Party had wanted an
Marcus Rashford complaint about

773
00:42:06.814 --> 00:42:07.856
Marcus Rashford complaint about
becoming politicised and if the

774
00:42:07.856 --> 00:42:08.981
becoming politicised and if the
Labour Party have wanted support

775
00:42:08.981 --> 00:42:09.314
labour Party have wanted support
they would

776
00:42:09.314 --> 00:42:10.314
Labour Party have wanted support
they would not have had an

777
00:42:10.314 --> 00:42:11.439
they would not have had an
opposition debate, they would have

778
00:42:11.439 --> 00:42:13.314
opposition debate, they would have
been other ways to build a Coalition

779
00:42:13.314 --> 00:42:16.231
been other ways to build a Coalition
in Parliament and I should just

780
00:42:16.231 --> 00:42:17.772
in Parliament and I should just
challenge the fact that as Education

781
00:42:17.772 --> 00:42:18.272
challenge the fact that as Education
Secretary. . .

782
00:42:18.272 --> 00:42:19.606
challenge the fact that as Education
Secretary... Was it a political

783
00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:20.897
Secretary... Was it a political
reason that the government did not

784
00:42:20.897 --> 00:42:22.856
reason that the government did not
support it or did the government not

785
00:42:22.856 --> 00:42:24.397
support it or did the government not
supported because it did not believe

786
00:42:24.397 --> 00:42:26.981
supported because it did not believe
in it? The government has put in

787
00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:29.106
in it? The government has put in
money dramatically to expand free

788
00:42:29.106 --> 00:42:33.022
money dramatically to expand free
school meals anyway. Did they not

789
00:42:33.022 --> 00:42:34.939
school meals anyway. Did they not
like the way Labour put the motion

790
00:42:34.939 --> 00:42:35.272
like the way labour put the motion
or

791
00:42:35.272 --> 00:42:36.856
like the way Labour put the motion
or because the government does not

792
00:42:36.856 --> 00:42:38.439
or because the government does not
believe in it on principle? The

793
00:42:38.439 --> 00:42:40.356
believe in it on principle? The
government has spent over £300

794
00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:42.356
government has spent over £300
million making sure that school meal

795
00:42:42.356 --> 00:42:43.606
million making sure that school meal
vouchers can be redeemed and to

796
00:42:43.606 --> 00:42:43.814
vouchers ran be redeemed and to
answer

797
00:42:43.814 --> 00:42:45.189
vouchers can be redeemed and to
answer the point made by

798
00:42:45.189 --> 00:42:45.356
vouchers can be redeemed and to
answer the point made byJoseph,

799
00:42:45.356 --> 00:42:45.522
answer the point made byjoseph,
when

800
00:42:45.522 --> 00:42:47.314
answer the point made byJoseph,
when schools were not open in the

801
00:42:47.314 --> 00:42:49.356
when schools were not open in the
spring and summer of this year, that

802
00:42:49.356 --> 00:42:51.147
spring and summer of this year, that
is exactly when the government did

803
00:42:51.147 --> 00:42:52.356
is exactly when the government did
put those hundreds of millions of

804
00:42:52.356 --> 00:42:54.731
put those hundreds of millions of
pounds in to make sure that meals

805
00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:56.731
pounds in to make sure that meals
were available to those children who

806
00:42:56.731 --> 00:42:59.439
were available to those children who
would otherwise be on free school

807
00:42:59.439 --> 00:43:00.981
would otherwise be on free school
meals. I personally think there are

808
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:05.439
meals. I personally think there are
other ways, and made a good point

809
00:43:05.439 --> 00:43:06.772
other ways, and made a good point
about needing an overall strategy

810
00:43:06.772 --> 00:43:09.939
about needing an overall strategy
but making sure we work with their

811
00:43:09.939 --> 00:43:11.606
but making sure we work with their
authorities, for example, the clue

812
00:43:11.606 --> 00:43:13.231
authorities, for example, the clue
is free school meals, we give

813
00:43:13.231 --> 00:43:16.772
is free school meals, we give
support to children at school,

814
00:43:16.772 --> 00:43:16.939
support to children at school,
pre—breakfast

815
00:43:16.939 --> 00:43:17.106
support to children at school,
pre—brea kfast clubs

816
00:43:17.106 --> 00:43:17.814
support to children at school,
pre—breakfast clubs and after—school

817
00:43:17.814 --> 00:43:17.981
pre-breakfast clubs and after-school
dubs

818
00:43:17.981 --> 00:43:18.147
pre-breakfast clubs and after-school
clubs and

819
00:43:18.147 --> 00:43:19.564
pre—breakfast clubs and after—school
clubs and everything else, but at

820
00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:22.022
clubs and everything else, but at
other times, when the schools have

821
00:43:22.022 --> 00:43:23.314
other times, when the schools have
been open, there are other ways in

822
00:43:23.314 --> 00:43:24.731
been open, there are other ways in
which to get money and the

823
00:43:24.731 --> 00:43:26.022
which to get money and the
government is putting money into

824
00:43:26.022 --> 00:43:26.189
government is putting money into
[oral

825
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:27.397
government is putting money into
local authorities and I am sure we

826
00:43:27.397 --> 00:43:27.772
[oral authorities and I am sure we
could do

827
00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:30.772
local authorities and I am sure we
could do more to put money via local

828
00:43:30.772 --> 00:43:30.897
could do more to put money via [oral
authorities

829
00:43:30.897 --> 00:43:32.606
could do more to put money via local
authorities to support families in

830
00:43:32.606 --> 00:43:35.231
authorities to support families in
need, but yesterday’s handling of

831
00:43:35.231 --> 00:43:35.356
need, but yesterdays handling of
the

832
00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:37.189
need, but yesterday’s handling of
the debate, watching that toxic

833
00:43:37.189 --> 00:43:38.564
the debate, watching that toxic
debate in Parliament, watching the

834
00:43:38.564 --> 00:43:39.522
debate in Partiament, watching the
“Y

835
00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:40.231
debate in Partiament, watching the
way that it

836
00:43:40.231 --> 00:43:41.022
debate in Parliament, watching the
way that it was handled, Bridget

837
00:43:41.022 --> 00:43:43.231
way that it was handled, Bridget
knows, if you want an issue really

838
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:45.189
knows, if you want an issue really
tackled, do not put it down as an

839
00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.231
tackled, do not put it down as an
Opposition Day motion if you want to

840
00:43:47.231 --> 00:43:50.064
Opposition Day motion if you want to
build a Coalition in Parliament.

841
00:43:50.064 --> 00:43:50.981
build a Coalition in Parliament.
People are going hungry over

842
00:43:50.981 --> 00:43:53.522
People are going hungry over
Christmas because you do not like

843
00:43:53.522 --> 00:43:54.481
Christmas because you do not like
the Parliamentary process. If you

844
00:43:54.481 --> 00:43:55.564
the Partiamentary process. If you
really want to

845
00:43:55.564 --> 00:43:56.231
the Parliamentary process. If you
really want to get people supporting

846
00:43:56.231 --> 00:43:59.106
really want to get peopla supporting
this

847
00:43:59.106 --> 00:43:59.814
really want to get people supporting
this debate, labelling Conservative

848
00:43:59.814 --> 00:44:03.606
this debate, labelling Conservative
MPs unconscionable and using

849
00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:05.439
MPs unconscionable and using
unparliamentary language and the way

850
00:44:05.439 --> 00:44:05.897
unpartiamentary language and the way
it was

851
00:44:05.897 --> 00:44:06.939
unparliamentary language and the way
it was dealt with, absolutely not.

852
00:44:06.939 --> 00:44:08.314
it was dealt with, absolutely not.
The government is putting their

853
00:44:08.314 --> 00:44:10.231
The government is putting their
money in and it would be better to

854
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:12.064
money in and it would be better to
work together to make sure that

855
00:44:12.064 --> 00:44:12.189
work together to make sure that
[oral

856
00:44:12.189 --> 00:44:13.022
work together to make sure that
local authorities and schools are

857
00:44:13.022 --> 00:44:13.564
[oral authorities and schools are
able to get

858
00:44:13.564 --> 00:44:14.772
local authorities and schools are
able to get that money and help to

859
00:44:14.772 --> 00:44:18.314
able to get that money and help to
support those children who are

860
00:44:18.314 --> 00:44:19.481
support those children who are
obviously otherwise not getting the

861
00:44:19.481 --> 00:44:21.064
obviously otherwise not getting the
sport at home. Very briefly, what do

862
00:44:21.064 --> 00:44:21.439
sport at home. Very brieﬂy, what do
you make of

863
00:44:21.439 --> 00:44:26.147
sport at home. Very briefly, what do
you make of that? I think the whole

864
00:44:26.147 --> 00:44:27.939
you make of that? I think the whole
issue of feeding children which is

865
00:44:27.939 --> 00:44:29.356
issue of feeding children which is
aptly fundamental has got caught up

866
00:44:29.356 --> 00:44:32.606
aptly fundamental has got caught up
in the political headlight here. It

867
00:44:32.606 --> 00:44:34.731
in the political headlight here. It
is something that failed yesterday,

868
00:44:34.731 --> 00:44:37.606
is something that failed yesterday,
I think, because it ended up as a

869
00:44:37.606 --> 00:44:38.981
I think, because it ended up as a
secondary issue here. It is too

870
00:44:38.981 --> 00:44:40.522
secondary issue here. It is too
important for that and I do think

871
00:44:40.522 --> 00:44:40.814
important for that and I do think
peopla have

872
00:44:40.814 --> 00:44:42.397
important for that and I do think
people have to work together to put

873
00:44:42.397 --> 00:44:42.564
peopla have to work together to put
this

874
00:44:42.564 --> 00:44:44.522
people have to work together to put
this aside. There has been a lot put

875
00:44:44.522 --> 00:44:46.439
this aside. There has been a lot put
in over recent months which means it

876
00:44:46.439 --> 00:44:48.314
in over recent months which means it
is even stranger to not put that

877
00:44:48.314 --> 00:44:48.689
is even stranger to not put that
extra 40

878
00:44:48.689 --> 00:44:50.064
is even stranger to not put that
extra A0 million and over the next

879
00:44:50.064 --> 00:44:50.314
extra 40 million and over the next
few

880
00:44:50.314 --> 00:44:52.189
extra A0 million and over the next
few weeks. That is what Wales and

881
00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:54.897
few weeks. That is what Wales and
Scotland are doing. At the end of

882
00:44:54.897 --> 00:44:56.022
Scotland are doing. At the end of
the day, all those long—term plans

883
00:44:56.022 --> 00:44:56.481
the day, all those long-term plans
need to

884
00:44:56.481 --> 00:44:57.981
the day, all those long—term plans
need to be there and all of the

885
00:44:57.981 --> 00:44:59.606
need to be there and all of the
different ways of supporting

886
00:44:59.606 --> 00:45:00.897
different ways of supporting
children is really important, but

887
00:45:00.897 --> 00:45:04.147
children is really important, but
free school meals, be they in school

888
00:45:04.147 --> 00:45:06.397
free school meals, be they in school
or not, it gets straight to skills

889
00:45:06.397 --> 00:45:07.731
or not, it gets straight to skills

kids and parents want. I want to
take a quick question from David

I want to take a quick question from

I want to take a quick question from
David Owens now. David. Thank you.

897
00:45:19.647 --> 00:45:21.772
Given how long this
has going on and there

898
00:45:21.772 --> 00:45:24.022
is no clear way out,
are we all going

899
00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:26.481
to follow the rules?

900
00:45:26.481 --> 00:45:36.314
Are you? Well, bearing in mind that
certain police officers don’t seem

901
00:45:36.314 --> 00:45:39.356
certain police officers don’t seem
to know the rules, it is very

902
00:45:39.356 --> 00:45:39.564
to know the mles, it is very
difficult,

903
00:45:39.564 --> 00:45:40.272
to know the rules, it is very
difficult, because they seem to

904
00:45:40.272 --> 00:45:42.022
difficult, because they seem to
change every couple of minutes. You

905
00:45:42.022 --> 00:45:43.481
change every couple of minutes. You
ran go into a pub

906
00:45:43.481 --> 00:45:44.272
change every couple of minutes. You
can go into a pub for a meal, but

907
00:45:44.272 --> 00:45:45.564
ran go into a pub for a meal, but
you cannot go in

908
00:45:45.564 --> 00:45:45.731
can go into a pub for a meal, but
you cannot go injust

909
00:45:45.731 --> 00:45:46.147
can go into a pub for a meal, but
you cannot go in just for a

910
00:45:46.147 --> 00:45:46.981
can go into a pub for a meal, but
you cannot go injust for a beer! We

911
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:47.897
you cannot go in just for a beer! We
need to

912
00:45:47.897 --> 00:45:49.689
you cannot go injust for a beer! We
need to see the science, we need to

913
00:45:49.689 --> 00:45:53.022
need to see the science, we need to
see the evidence of all these rules.

914
00:45:53.022 --> 00:45:53.439
see the evidence of all these mles.
Rita, I

915
00:45:53.439 --> 00:45:53.772
see the evidence of all these mles.
Rita, Ispoke

916
00:45:53.772 --> 00:45:54.022
see the evidence of all these mles.
Rita, I spoke to

917
00:45:54.022 --> 00:45:54.606
see the evidence of all these rules.
Rita, I spoke to you earlier before

918
00:45:54.606 --> 00:45:55.397
Rita, I spoke to you eartier before
we fame

919
00:45:55.397 --> 00:45:57.439
Rita, I spoke to you earlier before
we came on the programme and you had

920
00:45:57.439 --> 00:45:58.981
we came on the programme and you had
something rather interesting to say

921
00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:02.481
something rather interesting to say
about following the rules. Yes, I

922
00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:02.772
about following the mles. Yes, I
was just

923
00:46:02.772 --> 00:46:06.606
about following the rules. Yes, I
was just saying that people need

924
00:46:06.606 --> 00:46:07.231
was just saying that peopla need
peopla and

925
00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.439
was just saying that people need
people and my friend went through a

926
00:46:08.439 --> 00:46:10.189
people and my friend went through a
terrible experience last year that

927
00:46:10.189 --> 00:46:12.189
terrible experience last year that
nobody should ever have to go

928
00:46:12.189 --> 00:46:15.397
nobody should ever have to go
through, no parent, and she lives

929
00:46:15.397 --> 00:46:18.564
through, no parent, and she lives
alone and although I am not in her

930
00:46:18.564 --> 00:46:19.606
alone and although I am not in her
bubble, I would

931
00:46:19.606 --> 00:46:19.814
alone and although I am not in her
bubble, Iwould not

932
00:46:19.814 --> 00:46:20.064
alone and although I am not in her
bubble, I would not hesitate,

933
00:46:20.064 --> 00:46:20.231
alone and although I am not in her
bubble, Iwould not hesitate, if

934
00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:20.439
alone and although I am not in her
bubble, I would not hesitate, if she

935
00:46:20.439 --> 00:46:21.897
bubble, Iwould not hesitate, if she
needed me,

936
00:46:21.897 --> 00:46:23.439
bubble, I would not hesitate, if she
needed me, ever, to go and see her,

937
00:46:23.439 --> 00:46:25.814
needed me, ever, to go and see her,
he

938
00:46:25.814 --> 00:46:26.772
needed me, ever, to go and see her,
be with her, because people need

939
00:46:26.772 --> 00:46:29.814
be with her, because people need
people. A lot of people are not

940
00:46:29.814 --> 00:46:30.189
peopla. A lot of peopla are not
going to

941
00:46:30.189 --> 00:46:31.397
people. A lot of people are not
going to stick to the rules, not

942
00:46:31.397 --> 00:46:33.814
going to stick to the mles, not
just because

943
00:46:33.814 --> 00:46:34.647
going to stick to the rules, not
just because there are so many

944
00:46:34.647 --> 00:46:35.856
just because there are so many
people in this position.

945
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:48.564
It’s very situational. I am in
lockdown at the moment. I’ve got

946
00:46:48.564 --> 00:46:51.939
lockdown at the moment. I’ve got
five days to go before I come out of

947
00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:57.022
five days to go before I come out of
isolation. I have got family in

948
00:46:57.022 --> 00:46:58.772
isolation. I have got family in
Scotland under one set of rules,

949
00:46:58.772 --> 00:47:03.064
Scotland under one set of mles,
family in

950
00:47:03.064 --> 00:47:03.856
Scotland under one set of rules,
family in West Yorkshire, in

951
00:47:03.856 --> 00:47:05.064
family in West Yorkshire, in
Sedgefield and Durham it’s a

952
00:47:05.064 --> 00:47:06.189
Sedgefield and Durham it’s a
different rule, and I’ve got a

953
00:47:06.189 --> 00:47:06.647
different mle, and I’ve got a
daughter in

954
00:47:06.647 --> 00:47:07.689
different rule, and I’ve got a
daughter in Wales and we are all

955
00:47:07.689 --> 00:47:07.981
daughter in Walas and we are all
living in

956
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:09.106
daughter in Wales and we are all
living in different variations and

957
00:47:09.106 --> 00:47:10.439
living in different variations and
going into different types of

958
00:47:10.439 --> 00:47:15.856
going into different types of
lockdown, and it’s hard to keep to

959
00:47:15.856 --> 00:47:16.231
lockdown, and it’s hard to keep to
the mles.

960
00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:17.689
lockdown, and it’s hard to keep to
the rules. Personally, I do keep to

961
00:47:17.689 --> 00:47:18.064
the mles. Personally, I do keep to
the mles

962
00:47:18.064 --> 00:47:18.897
the rules. Personally, I do keep to
the rules because of my background

963
00:47:18.897 --> 00:47:20.314
the mles because of my background
working in the

964
00:47:20.314 --> 00:47:24.564
the rules because of my background
working in the NHS and social

965
00:47:24.564 --> 00:47:25.689
working in the NHS and social
responsibility, but I can also

966
00:47:25.689 --> 00:47:26.689
responsibility, but I can also
self—isolated. I’m in that lucky

967
00:47:26.689 --> 00:47:29.897
self-isolated. I’m in that lucky
position.

968
00:47:29.897 --> 00:47:31.189
position.
I’m interested, considering we are

969
00:47:31.189 --> 00:47:33.772
I’m interested, considering we are
in a national lockdown, but it eased

970
00:47:33.772 --> 00:47:35.814
in a national lockdown, but it eased
off over the summer and we are now

971
00:47:35.814 --> 00:47:37.231
off over the summer and we are now
heading back into who knows how long

972
00:47:37.231 --> 00:47:37.981
heading back into who knows how long
of restrictions, whether attitudes

973
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:43.064
of restrictions, whether attitudes
have changed. Eileen. I am 7A and

974
00:47:43.064 --> 00:47:43.231
have changed. Eilaen. I am 74 and
live

975
00:47:43.231 --> 00:47:43.397
have changed. Eileen. I am 74 and
live alone

976
00:47:43.397 --> 00:47:45.981
have changed. Eileen. I am 7A and
live alone and I need family, I need

977
00:47:45.981 --> 00:47:46.981
live alone and I need family, I need
people for mental health reasons,

978
00:47:46.981 --> 00:47:47.397
people for mental health reasons,
really, so

979
00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:47.564
people for mental health reasons,
really, sol

980
00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.772
people for mental health reasons,
really, so I don’t think I will be

981
00:47:49.772 --> 00:47:53.022
really, so I don’t think I will be
totally sticking to it, whereas I am

982
00:47:53.022 --> 00:47:54.231
totally sticking to it, whereas I am
very careful, and they are very

983
00:47:54.231 --> 00:47:56.689
very careful, and they are very
careful with me, but what choices do

984
00:47:56.689 --> 00:48:01.189
careful with me, but what choices do
I have? Did you stick to it

985
00:48:01.189 --> 00:48:02.397
I have? Did you stick to it
religiously the first time, back in

986
00:48:02.397 --> 00:48:07.356
religiously the first time, back in
March?

987
00:48:07.731 --> 00:48:11.022
March? Yes. First time round, but it
was very difficult, very difficult.

988
00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:15.397
was very difficult, very difficult.
Now my grandson comes and does the

989
00:48:15.397 --> 00:48:17.022
Now my grandson comes and does the
garden. I have a big garden and he

990
00:48:17.022 --> 00:48:19.314
garden. I have a big garden and he
comes and does it for me, and I have

991
00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:21.147
comes and does it for me, and I have
a couple of friends who have come

992
00:48:21.147 --> 00:48:22.231
a couple of friends who have come
round, and obviously my daughters

993
00:48:22.231 --> 00:48:24.564
round, and obviously my daughters
and sons. I couldn’t live here on my

994
00:48:24.564 --> 00:48:29.189
and sons. I couldn’t live here on my
own. I need help with a big house.

995
00:48:29.189 --> 00:48:34.147
own. I need help with a big house.
Louis. I think we’ve seen a couple

996
00:48:34.147 --> 00:48:35.356
Louis. I think we’ve seen a couple
of recent examples in the country

997
00:48:35.356 --> 00:48:37.022
of recent examples in the country
first up we had a funeral where a

998
00:48:37.022 --> 00:48:40.356
first up we had a funeral where a
son was prevented from comforting

999
00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:41.731
son was prevented from comforting
his grieving mother because it went

1000
00:48:41.731 --> 00:48:44.439
his grieving mother because it went
against the rules, and I saw an

1001
00:48:44.439 --> 00:48:44.564
against the mles, and I saw an
interview

1002
00:48:44.564 --> 00:48:45.606
against the rules, and I saw an
interview on the BBC yesterday when

1003
00:48:45.606 --> 00:48:45.772
interview on the BBC yesterday when
84-year-old

1004
00:48:45.772 --> 00:48:48.022
interview on the BBC yesterday when
84—year—old said she had very few

1005
00:48:48.022 --> 00:48:48.647
84-year-old said she had very few
years left and

1006
00:48:48.647 --> 00:48:49.397
84—year—old said she had very few
years left and she wasn’t going to

1007
00:48:49.397 --> 00:48:51.606
years left and she wasn’t going to
spend them confide in a house. I

1008
00:48:51.606 --> 00:48:53.772
spend them confide in a house. I
have an 83 rod grandmother who lives

1009
00:48:53.772 --> 00:48:55.856
have an 83 rod grandmother who lives
alone, a widow. If I didn’t go and

1010
00:48:55.856 --> 00:48:58.397
alone, a widow. If I didn’t go and
see her, I think the effect on her

1011
00:48:58.397 --> 00:49:00.272
see her, I think the effect on her
mental health would probably equal

1012
00:49:00.272 --> 00:49:01.272
mental health would probably equal
the threat that Covid would

1013
00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:03.231
the threat that Covid would
eventually equate to, so at what

1014
00:49:03.231 --> 00:49:05.439
eventually equate to, so at what
point to the restrictions get in the

1015
00:49:05.439 --> 00:49:05.564
point to the restrictions get in the
“Y

1016
00:49:05.564 --> 00:49:06.772
point to the restrictions get in the
way of being a basic, decent human

1017
00:49:06.772 --> 00:49:10.647
way of being a basic, decent human
being? I

1018
00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:10.939
way of being a basic, decent human
being? lam

1019
00:49:10.939 --> 00:49:12.231
way of being a basic, decent human
being? I am a teacher at Sedgefield

1020
00:49:12.231 --> 00:49:13.356
being? I am a teacher at Sedgefield
community college and, over the past

1021
00:49:13.356 --> 00:49:14.939
community college and, over the past
couple of weeks, we have been told

1022
00:49:14.939 --> 00:49:16.939
couple of weeks, we have been told
we need to reduce our social

1023
00:49:16.939 --> 00:49:21.231
we need to reduce our social
contact, but I feel as a teacher,

1024
00:49:21.231 --> 00:49:22.272
contact, but I feel as a teacher,
and also other

1025
00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:22.897
contact, but I feel as a teacher,
and also otherjobs, it’s very

1026
00:49:22.897 --> 00:49:23.106
and also other jobs, it’s very
difficult

1027
00:49:23.106 --> 00:49:24.106
and also otherjobs, it’s very
difficult to reduce our social

1028
00:49:24.106 --> 00:49:27.272
difficult to reduce our social
contact, when we come into contact

1029
00:49:27.272 --> 00:49:28.314
contact, when we come into contact
with hundreds of students every

1030
00:49:28.314 --> 00:49:31.731
with hundreds of students every
single day. And Sarah, one point

1031

singla day. And Sarah, one point
from you. My

1032
00:49:35.522 --> 00:49:36.814
single day. And Sarah, one point
from you. My son is one of his

1033
00:49:36.814 --> 00:49:37.814
from you. My son is one of his
students and is currently isolating

1034
00:49:37.814 --> 00:49:39.772
students and is currently isolating
at home. I am a

1035
00:49:39.772 --> 00:49:40.356
students and is currently isolating
at home. I am areal

1036
00:49:40.356 --> 00:49:40.606
students and is currently isolating
at home. I am a real stickler

1037
00:49:40.606 --> 00:49:40.856
students and is currently isolating
at home. I am a real sticklerfor

1038
00:49:40.856 --> 00:49:41.231
at home. I am a real sticklar for
the mles

1039
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:42.022
at home. I am a real sticklerfor
the rules but I totally understand

1040
00:49:42.022 --> 00:49:42.189
the mles but I totally understand
the

1041
00:49:42.189 --> 00:49:44.772
the rules but I totally understand
the compassionate need to see

1042
00:49:44.772 --> 00:49:48.564
the compassionate need to see
people, I totally support that, but

1043
00:49:48.564 --> 00:49:49.272
peopla, I totally support that, but
it’s incredibly

1044
00:49:49.272 --> 00:49:50.606
people, I totally support that, but
it’s incredibly hard as a parent to

1045
00:49:50.606 --> 00:49:51.606
it’s incredibly hard as a parent to
be encouraging your children to

1046
00:49:51.606 --> 00:49:53.231
be encouraging your children to
follow the rules when they see

1047
00:49:53.231 --> 00:49:53.397
follow the mles when they see
peopla

1048
00:49:53.397 --> 00:49:54.314
follow the rules when they see
people breaking them left, right and

1049
00:49:54.314 --> 00:49:57.689
people breaking them left, right and
centre. I don’t want to spend too

1050
00:49:57.689 --> 00:50:01.064
centre. I don’t want to spend too
long on this, but Bridget or Nicky,

1051
00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:01.439
long on this, but Bridget or Nicky,
brieﬂy, how

1052
00:50:01.439 --> 00:50:03.564
long on this, but Bridget or Nicky,
briefly, how much a concern is this?

1053
00:50:03.564 --> 00:50:04.189
brieﬂy, how much a concern is this?
I suspect our

1054
00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:05.772
briefly, how much a concern is this?
I suspect our audience are not

1055
00:50:05.772 --> 00:50:07.856
I suspect our audience are not
alone, they are not naturally rule

1056
00:50:07.856 --> 00:50:08.064
alone, they are not naturally mle
breakers,

1057
00:50:08.064 --> 00:50:08.814
alone, they are not naturally rule
breakers, and I’m making an

1058
00:50:08.814 --> 00:50:11.064
breakers, and I’m making an
assumption about ones we have heard

1059
00:50:11.064 --> 00:50:12.022
assumption about ones we have heard
from, but they are acting

1060
00:50:12.022 --> 00:50:14.731
from, but they are acting
differently this time round,

1061
00:50:14.731 --> 00:50:16.731
differently this time round,
especially with Labour, who was a

1062
00:50:16.731 --> 00:50:16.939
especially with labour, who was a
national

1063
00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:17.897
especially with Labour, who was a
national lockdown to stop if people

1064
00:50:17.897 --> 00:50:18.522
national lockdown to stop if peopla
are not going

1065
00:50:18.522 --> 00:50:19.356
national lockdown to stop if people
are not going to obey the rules,

1066
00:50:19.356 --> 00:50:19.522
are not going to obey the mles,
what’s

1067
00:50:19.522 --> 00:50:22.356
are not going to obey the rules,
what’s the point? We are not arguing

1068
00:50:22.356 --> 00:50:24.772
what’s the point? We are not arguing
for a national lockdown. Cue you

1069
00:50:24.772 --> 00:50:27.439
for a national lockdown. Cue you
want a circuit breaker. We are not

1070
00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:29.356
want a circuit breaker. We are not
calling for an ongoing national

1071
00:50:29.356 --> 00:50:33.189
calling for an ongoing national
lockdown. However

1072
00:50:33.189 --> 00:50:33.397
calling for an ongoing national
lockdown. Howeveryou

1073
00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.022
calling for an ongoing national
lockdown. However you want to define

1074
00:50:34.022 --> 00:50:35.231
lockdown. However you want to define
it, how concerned are you that

1075
00:50:35.231 --> 00:50:35.647
it, how concerned are you that
peopla will

1076
00:50:35.647 --> 00:50:36.564
it, how concerned are you that
people will not obey the rules out

1077
00:50:36.564 --> 00:50:37.022
peopla will not obey the mles out
of sheer

1078
00:50:37.022 --> 00:50:38.856
people will not obey the rules out
of sheer fatigue?

1079
00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:39.397
people will not obey the rules out
of sheerfatigue? It’s

1080
00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:39.981
people will not obey the rules out
of sheer fatigue? It’s tough, and

1081
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:40.147
people will not obey the rules out
of sheerfatigue? It’s tough, and I

1082
00:50:40.147 --> 00:50:40.522
of sheer fatigue? It’s tough, and I
hear that.

1083
00:50:40.522 --> 00:50:40.647
of sheerfatigue? It’s tough, and I
hearthat. In

1084
00:50:40.647 --> 00:50:41.981
of sheerfatigue? It’s tough, and I
hear that. In large part of the

1085
00:50:41.981 --> 00:50:43.189
hear that. In large part of the
north—east we have had restrictions

1086
00:50:43.189 --> 00:50:43.814
north-east we have had restrictions
in place for

1087
00:50:43.814 --> 00:50:44.772
north—east we have had restrictions
in place for some time and I know

1088
00:50:44.772 --> 00:50:45.397
in place for some time and I know
that peopla are

1089
00:50:45.397 --> 00:50:46.231
in place for some time and I know
that people are fatigued by it and

1090
00:50:46.231 --> 00:50:46.522
that peopla are fatigued by it and
want to

1091
00:50:46.522 --> 00:50:48.022
that people are fatigued by it and
want to see a way through the top of

1092
00:50:48.022 --> 00:50:51.564
want to see a way through the top of
course we have to follow the rules.

1093
00:50:51.564 --> 00:50:52.022
course we have to follow the mles.
What it

1094
00:50:52.022 --> 00:50:55.522
course we have to follow the rules.
What it tells me is what we are

1095
00:50:55.522 --> 00:50:55.981
what it tells me is what we are
embarking or

1096
00:50:55.981 --> 00:50:57.689
What it tells me is what we are
embarking or is something that is

1097
00:50:57.689 --> 00:50:58.772
embarking or is something that is
much psychological as anything else,

1098
00:50:58.772 --> 00:51:00.481
much psychological as anything else,
and that means that rules have to be

1099
00:51:00.481 --> 00:51:00.689
and that means that mles have to be
designed

1100
00:51:00.689 --> 00:51:01.231
and that means that rules have to be
designed understanding how tough

1101
00:51:01.231 --> 00:51:04.564
designed understanding how tough
they are going to be for people, and

1102
00:51:04.564 --> 00:51:04.772
they are going to be for peopla, and
understanding

1103
00:51:04.772 --> 00:51:07.939
they are going to be for people, and
understanding what we are asking of

1104
00:51:07.939 --> 00:51:08.564
understanding what we are asking of
them. Obviously, I

1105
00:51:08.564 --> 00:51:08.731
understanding what we are asking of
them. Obviously, Iwould

1106
00:51:08.731 --> 00:51:09.314
understanding what we are asking of
them. Obviously, I would encourage

1107
00:51:09.314 --> 00:51:09.981
them. Obviously, Iwould encourage
people to stick

1108
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:10.772
them. Obviously, I would encourage
people to stick to the rules, but

1109
00:51:10.772 --> 00:51:11.356
peopla to stick to the mles, but
peopla have

1110
00:51:11.356 --> 00:51:12.939
people to stick to the rules, but
people have talked about the mental

1111
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.606
people have talked about the mental
health burden, and that is obviously

1112
00:51:14.606 --> 00:51:16.356
health burden, and that is obviously
massive, but I think, in the grand

1113
00:51:16.356 --> 00:51:18.564
massive, but I think, in the grand
scheme of things, there will be a

1114
00:51:18.564 --> 00:51:18.731
scheme of things, there will be a
“Y

1115
00:51:18.731 --> 00:51:20.356
scheme of things, there will be a
way out, we will get through,

1116
00:51:20.356 --> 00:51:21.439
way out, we will get through,
history tells us that, but

1117
00:51:21.439 --> 00:51:22.647
history tells us that, but
unfortunately it’s going to be a

1118
00:51:22.647 --> 00:51:24.564
unfortunately it’s going to be a
very difficult few months. And a

1119
00:51:24.564 --> 00:51:29.022
very difficult few months. And a
final question which, when I started

1120
00:51:29.022 --> 00:51:29.772
final question which, when I started
on Question Time, dominated

1121
00:51:29.772 --> 00:51:31.231
on Question Time, dominated
everything for months on end and I

1122
00:51:31.231 --> 00:51:32.397
everything for months on end and I
thought we would never talk about

1123
00:51:32.397 --> 00:51:33.689
thought we would never talk about
anything else! Let’s bring it back

1124
00:51:33.689 --> 00:51:36.481
anything else! Let’s bring it back
with Carol.

1125
00:51:36.481 --> 00:51:39.814
With global economies being
decimated by the COVID 19 pandemic,

1126
00:51:39.814 --> 00:51:43.272
is now really the best time to be
walking into a no deal

1127
00:51:43.272 --> 00:51:47.731
situation with the EU,
regardless of dressing it up

1128
00:51:47.731 --> 00:51:52.731
as a meaningless "Australia deal"?

00:52:01.272 --> 00:52:02.481
Joe said, let’s hear your as a Nobel
prize—winning economist. ——Joseph.

1133
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:03.189
prize-winning economist. -- joseph.
I think it

1134
00:52:03.189 --> 00:52:06.981
prize—winning economist. ——Joseph.
I think it was a bad thing to look

1135
00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:08.314
I think it was a bad thing to look
into, a no—deal Brexit, any time,

1136
00:52:08.314 --> 00:52:08.981
into, a no-deal Brexit, any time,
but this is

1137
00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:12.439
into, a no—deal Brexit, any time,
but this is an especially bad time.

1138
00:52:12.439 --> 00:52:15.731
but this is an especially bad time.
The global economy is going to be

1139
00:52:15.731 --> 00:52:15.897
The global economy is going to be
weak.

1140
00:52:15.897 --> 00:52:19.939
The global economy is going to be
week. There is a slowdown

1141
00:52:19.939 --> 00:52:24.731
week. There is a slowdown
everywhere, but in Europe, and that

1142
00:52:24.731 --> 00:52:30.397
everywhere, but in Europe, and that
will of itself impose constraints on

1143
00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:31.731
will of itself impose constraints on
trade. And then there is a slowdown

1144
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:36.772
trade. And then there is a slowdown
in the UK, and on top of all that,

1145
00:52:36.772 --> 00:52:39.314
in the UK, and on top of all that,
to put new trade barriers seems

1146
00:52:39.314 --> 00:52:39.814
to put new trade barriers seems
particularty

1147
00:52:39.814 --> 00:52:43.481
to put new trade barriers seems
particularly foolish. On top of

1148
00:52:43.481 --> 00:52:44.106
particularty foolish. On top of
that, to do

1149
00:52:44.106 --> 00:52:45.522
particularly foolish. On top of
that, to do it in a context where

1150
00:52:45.522 --> 00:52:48.481
that, to do it in a context where
there is no deal, where there is

1151
00:52:48.481 --> 00:52:51.314
there is no deal, where there is
uncertainty about the political, how

1152
00:52:51.314 --> 00:52:53.522
uncertainty about the political, how
is the Ireland issue going to be

1153
00:52:53.522 --> 00:52:55.689
is the Ireland issue going to be
dealt with? Where are the

1154
00:52:55.689 --> 00:53:02.314
dealt with? Where are the
boundaries? What would be the

1155
00:53:02.314 --> 00:53:04.189
boundaries? What would be the
consequences? Enormous amount of

1156
00:53:04.189 --> 00:53:05.814
consequences? Enormous amount of
uncertainty, and what we have heard

1157
00:53:05.814 --> 00:53:07.231
uncertainty, and what we have heard
in the discussion in the last hour

1158
00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:09.981
in the discussion in the last hour
is how the pandemic has brought

1159
00:53:09.981 --> 00:53:11.689
is how the pandemic has brought
uncertainty, how the government’s

1160
00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:12.106
uncertainty, how the government’s
failure to

1161
00:53:12.106 --> 00:53:12.231
uncertainty, how the government’s
hhmhyn

1162
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:12.939
uncertainty, how the government’s
failure to give the kinds of

1163
00:53:12.939 --> 00:53:16.397
failure to give the kinds of
assistance at the right time, in a

1164
00:53:16.397 --> 00:53:17.522
assistance at the right time, in a
timely way has enhanced the

1165
00:53:17.522 --> 00:53:21.314
timely way has enhanced the
uncertainty that individuals face,

1166
00:53:21.314 --> 00:53:24.939
uncertainty that individuals face,
so we have the pandemic, we have the

1167
00:53:24.939 --> 00:53:26.522
so we have the pandemic, we have the
inadequate economic response to the

1168
00:53:26.522 --> 00:53:29.272
inadequate economic response to the
pandemic, and now we have the

1169
00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:31.314
pandemic, and now we have the
uncertainty of a no—deal Brexit. It

1170
00:53:31.314 --> 00:53:33.522
uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. It
seems to me,

1171
00:53:33.522 --> 00:53:34.564
uncertainty of a no—deal Brexit. It
seems to me, if you were going to

1172
00:53:34.564 --> 00:53:35.897
seems to me, if you were going to
maximise uncertainty, you couldn’t

1173
00:53:35.897 --> 00:53:36.689
maximise uncertainty, you couldn’t
have done a better

1174
00:53:36.689 --> 00:53:40.897
maximise uncertainty, you couldn’t
have done a betterjob. I run a

1175
00:53:40.897 --> 00:53:41.147
have done a better job. I nm a
business

1176
00:53:41.147 --> 00:53:45.397
have done a betterjob. I run a
business with about 7500, 8000

1177
00:53:45.397 --> 00:53:47.147
business with about 7500, 8000
employees in the UK, and we also

1178
00:53:47.147 --> 00:53:48.564
employees in the UK, and we also
operate in France and Spain. I run

1179
00:53:48.564 --> 00:53:52.397
operate in France and Spain. I mn
an aircraft

1180
00:53:52.397 --> 00:53:53.147
operate in France and Spain. I run
an aircraft business, building

1181
00:53:53.147 --> 00:53:55.981
an aircraft business, building
electric flying taxes, with a big

1182
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:56.231
electric ﬂying taxes, with a big
European

1183
00:53:56.231 --> 00:53:57.231
electric flying taxes, with a big
European supply chain, and Brexit is

1184
00:53:57.231 --> 00:53:58.731
European supply chain, and Brexit is
not in the top ten list of things

1185
00:53:58.731 --> 00:54:00.231
not in the top ten list of things
that I spent my time thinking about

1186
00:54:00.231 --> 00:54:03.481
that I spent my time thinking about
or worrying about. Is that because

1187
00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:04.272
or worrying about. Is that because
you wouldn’t be particularly

1188
00:54:04.272 --> 00:54:06.772
you wouldn’t be particularly
affected? There are much bigger

1189
00:54:06.772 --> 00:54:11.314
affected? There are much bigger
issues. I have to say, I think,

1190
00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:11.522
affected? There are much bigger
issues. I have to say, Ithink, if

1191
00:54:11.522 --> 00:54:15.272
issues. I have to say, Ithink, if
you look at where we are right now

1192
00:54:15.272 --> 00:54:16.439
you look at where we are right now
in the negotiations, we have a

1193
00:54:16.439 --> 00:54:19.356
in the negotiations, we have a
couple of months left to go, I think

1194
00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:20.314
couple of months left to go, I think
it’s absolutely right that the

1195
00:54:20.314 --> 00:54:22.981
it’s absolutely right that the
government is saying, we need to

1196
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:24.606
government is saying, we need to
have a strong full back position. As

1197
00:54:24.606 --> 00:54:25.981
have a strong full back position. As
somebody who has been a lot of

1198
00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:28.772
somebody who has been a lot of
negotiation, in a negotiation you

1199
00:54:28.772 --> 00:54:30.439
negotiation, in a negotiation you
have to say, we are going to shake

1200
00:54:30.439 --> 00:54:32.356
have to say, we are going to shake
hands and walk away if we don’t get

1201
00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:33.897
hands and walk away if we don’t get
an agreement. You have to be in a

1202
00:54:33.897 --> 00:54:35.731
an agreement. You have to be in a
position where people are ready for

1203
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:36.606
position where peopla are ready for
that, and I

1204
00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:37.356
position where people are ready for
that, and I am optimistic, and I

1205
00:54:37.356 --> 00:54:38.231
that, and lam optimistic, and I
hope we will

1206
00:54:38.231 --> 00:54:39.064
that, and I am optimistic, and I
hope we will find the right

1207
00:54:39.064 --> 00:54:40.939
hope we will find the right
agreement but, if you look at the

1208
00:54:40.939 --> 00:54:42.022
agreement but, if you look at the
history of EU trade negotiations,

1209
00:54:42.022 --> 00:54:44.564
history of EU trade negotiations,
it’s very difficult. Can a debt

1210
00:54:44.564 --> 00:54:44.772
it’s very difficult. (“an a debt
negotiator

1211
00:54:44.772 --> 00:54:45.814
it’s very difficult. Can a debt
negotiator for seven years to get

1212
00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:47.231
negotiator for seven years to get
their free trade agreement and it

1213
00:54:47.231 --> 00:54:48.814
their free trade agreement and it
was held up by one state in Belgium

1214
00:54:48.814 --> 00:54:52.981
was held up by one state in Belgium
for a year. So God help us, is that

1215
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:56.772
for a year. So God help us, is that
what you are saying? We have to have

1216
00:54:56.772 --> 00:54:58.564
what you are saying? We have to have
a robust negotiating position but we

1217
00:54:58.564 --> 00:54:59.897
a robust negotiating position but we
also have to think about what kind

1218
00:54:59.897 --> 00:55:01.397
also have to think about what kind
of economy we are going to build,

1219
00:55:01.397 --> 00:55:02.814
of economy we are going to build,
what does independence from the you

1220
00:55:02.814 --> 00:55:06.731
what does independence from the you
you must freedom to do, more

1221
00:55:06.731 --> 00:55:09.522
you must freedom to do, more
renewable energy, carbon price and

1222
00:55:09.522 --> 00:55:11.564
renewable energy, carbon price and
taxation, we will have COP26 in the

1223
00:55:11.564 --> 00:55:12.189
taxation, we will have (20st in the
UK, and we

1224
00:55:12.189 --> 00:55:13.439
taxation, we will have COP26 in the
UK, and we have an opportunity to

1225
00:55:13.439 --> 00:55:13.731
UK, and we have an opportunity to
[ad the

1226
00:55:13.731 --> 00:55:14.772
UK, and we have an opportunity to
lead the world in the next zero

1227
00:55:14.772 --> 00:55:16.439
lead the world in the next zero
transition. That is the opportunity

1228
00:55:16.439 --> 00:55:21.814
transition. That is the opportunity
we should be talking about. I think

1229
00:55:21.814 --> 00:55:23.522
we should be talking about. I think
it’s hard to believe that this is

1230
00:55:23.522 --> 00:55:25.231
it’s hard to believe that this is
almost a PS question whereas, at one

1231
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:28.147
almost a PS question whereas, at one
point, it dominated completely. Tell

1232
00:55:28.147 --> 00:55:28.481
point, it dominated complately. Tell
me about

1233
00:55:28.481 --> 00:55:33.356
point, it dominated completely. Tell
me about it! What it did do was it

1234
00:55:33.356 --> 00:55:33.897
me about it! what it did do was it
drove out any

1235
00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:34.647
me about it! What it did do was it
drove out any discussion about

1236
00:55:34.647 --> 00:55:36.522
drove out any discussion about
domestic issues for that time, so

1237
00:55:36.522 --> 00:55:38.272
domestic issues for that time, so
that was my real worry, it wiped

1238
00:55:38.272 --> 00:55:42.564
that was my real worry, it wiped
that off the agenda. Clearly it adds

1239
00:55:42.564 --> 00:55:42.731
that off the agenda. Cleariy it adds
to

1240
00:55:42.731 --> 00:55:44.231
that off the agenda. Clearly it adds
to uncertainty. It wouldn’t be

1241
00:55:44.231 --> 00:55:46.064
to uncertainty. It wouldn’t be
ideal. But, you know, like it or

1242
00:55:46.064 --> 00:55:48.189
ideal. But, you know, like it or
not, it is going to happen, and now

1243
00:55:48.189 --> 00:55:48.814
not, it is going to happen, and now
I think peopla

1244
00:55:48.814 --> 00:55:49.897
not, it is going to happen, and now
I think people need to see what this

1245
00:55:49.897 --> 00:55:50.189
I think peopla need to see what this
does

1246
00:55:50.189 --> 00:55:51.689
I think people need to see what this
does mean for the future, in terms

1247
00:55:51.689 --> 00:55:51.981
does mean for the future, in terms
of

1248
00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:53.189
does mean for the future, in terms
ofjobs, in terms of progress, and

1249
00:55:53.189 --> 00:55:57.606
ofjobs, in terms of progress, and
how this will help our area actually

1250
00:55:57.606 --> 00:56:00.314
how this will help our area actually
not only get back on their feet but

1251
00:56:00.314 --> 00:56:03.022
not only get back on their feet but
get ahead. There is a lot at stake,

1252
00:56:03.022 --> 00:56:07.689
get ahead. There is a lot at stake,
obviously. This absolutely has to

1253
00:56:07.689 --> 00:56:09.147
obviously. This absolutely has to
work for the kind of questions we

1254
00:56:09.147 --> 00:56:12.022
work for the kind of questions we
have seen this evening. I sincerely

1255
00:56:12.022 --> 00:56:14.606
have seen this evening. I sincerely
hope that we get a deal for the

1256
00:56:14.606 --> 00:56:15.606
hope that we get a deal for the
businesses in the north—east are

1257
00:56:15.606 --> 00:56:16.231
businesses in the north-east are
facing a tough

1258
00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:19.231
businesses in the north—east are
facing a tough enough time without

1259
00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:21.606
facing a tough enough time without
this added uncertainty for the great

1260
00:56:21.606 --> 00:56:23.189
this added uncertainty for the great
manufacturing export businesses that

1261
00:56:23.189 --> 00:56:24.981
manufacturing export businesses that
depend on that trade. I sincerely

1262
00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:26.522
depend on that trade. I sincerely
hope the government do absolutely

1263
00:56:26.522 --> 00:56:28.481
hope the government do absolutely
everything to get the deal, stop the

1264
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:29.564
everything to get the deal, stop the
posturing, stop messing about and

1265
00:56:29.564 --> 00:56:34.606
posturing, stop messing about and
get it done. Dropped the posturing,

1266
00:56:34.606 --> 00:56:36.522
get it done. Dropped the posturing,
Nicky. The news today is the fact

1267
00:56:36.522 --> 00:56:37.606
Nicky. The news today is the fact
that discussions are continuing, and

1268
00:56:37.606 --> 00:56:39.314
that discussions are continuing, and
I think they will and I am hopeful

1269
00:56:39.314 --> 00:56:40.689
I think they will and I am hopeful
there will be a deal, so

1270
00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:40.939
I think they will and I am hopeful
there will be a deal, sol

1271
00:56:40.939 --> 00:56:41.189
I think they will and I am hopeful
there will be a deal, so I don’t

1272
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:42.772
there will be a deal, so I don’t
think we are heading to the outlined

1273
00:56:42.772 --> 00:56:45.939
think we are heading to the outlined
by our question of the top what we

1274
00:56:45.939 --> 00:56:46.731
by our question of the top what we
can’t do is tarry

1275
00:56:46.731 --> 00:56:47.314
by our question of the top what we
can’t do is carry on extending the

1276
00:56:47.314 --> 00:56:49.314
can’t do is carry on extending the
transition period, getting

1277
00:56:49.314 --> 00:56:54.606
transition period, getting
businesses to prepare and do not

1278
00:56:54.606 --> 00:56:55.772
businesses to prepare and do not
prepare, and Stephen said that of

1279
00:56:55.772 --> 00:56:57.106
prepare, and Stephen said that of
the top ten things to worry about

1280
00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:59.522
the top ten things to worry about
this is not on it, I don’t know if

1281
00:56:59.522 --> 00:57:04.189
this is not on it, I don’t know if
it was, but it’s not now. Hindsight

1282
00:57:04.189 --> 00:57:05.564
it was, but it’s not now. Hindsight
is a marvellous thing but, if you

1283
00:57:05.564 --> 00:57:07.189
is a marvellous thing but, if you
had been able to look into a crystal

1284
00:57:07.189 --> 00:57:09.314
had been able to look into a crystal
ball and no that we were going to be

1285
00:57:09.314 --> 00:57:12.356
ball and no that we were going to be
leaving the EU in the middle of a

1286
00:57:12.356 --> 00:57:14.231
leaving the EU in the middle of a
pandemic, with a recession forecast

1287
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:16.314
pandemic, with a recession forecast
the likes of which we have never

1288
00:57:16.314 --> 00:57:18.106
the likes of which we have never
seen, or not for hundreds of years,

1289
00:57:18.106 --> 00:57:18.856
seen, or not for hundreds of years,
would you really want

1290
00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:19.147
seen, or not for hundreds of years,
would you really wa nt to

1291
00:57:19.147 --> 00:57:19.731
seen, or not for hundreds of years,
would you really want to be doing it

1292
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:23.189
would you really want to be doing it
now? As you say, who knows? We don’t

1293
00:57:23.189 --> 00:57:25.439
now? As you say, who knows? We don’t
know what’s going to happen for the

1294
00:57:25.439 --> 00:57:26.772
know what’s going to happen for the
what you would try to have done

1295
00:57:26.772 --> 00:57:29.106
what you would try to have done
would be to have left completely in

1296
00:57:29.106 --> 00:57:30.564
would be to have left completely in
the Slst of January this year, so

1297
00:57:30.564 --> 00:57:30.689
the 31st of january this year, so
that

1298
00:57:30.689 --> 00:57:31.981
the 31st of January this year, so
that were clear by the time the

1299
00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:34.439
that were clear by the time the
government had to be dealing with

1300
00:57:34.439 --> 00:57:36.897
government had to be dealing with
the pandemic, and the lesson we

1301
00:57:36.897 --> 00:57:38.189
the pandemic, and the lesson we
learnt from the three years before

1302
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:39.564
learnt from the three years before
that is you keep kicking the can

1303
00:57:39.564 --> 00:57:39.731
that is you keep kicking the ran
down

1304
00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:41.231
that is you keep kicking the can
down the road it doesn’t get easier.

1305
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:44.231
down the road it doesn’t get easier.
People voted the way they did in

1306
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:45.522
People voted the way they did in
2016, including many people in the

1307
00:57:45.522 --> 00:57:46.106
2016, including many peopla in the
parts of the

1308
00:57:46.106 --> 00:57:46.856
2016, including many people in the
parts of the country where we have

1309
00:57:46.856 --> 00:57:51.731
parts of the country where we have
audience on tonight. They waited a

1310
00:57:51.731 --> 00:57:52.397
audience on tonight. They waited a
long time in order

1311
00:57:52.397 --> 00:57:53.064
audience on tonight. They waited a
long time in orderfor this to

1312
00:57:53.064 --> 00:57:53.939
long time in order for this to
happen. I

1313
00:57:53.939 --> 00:57:54.856
long time in orderfor this to
happen. I think it’s right that we

1314
00:57:54.856 --> 00:57:59.522
happen. I think it’s right that we
get on with it. It is possible. We

1315
00:57:59.522 --> 00:58:00.481
get on with it. It is possible. We
have ministers engaged in that,

1316
00:58:00.481 --> 00:58:02.189
have ministers engaged in that,
civil servants engaged in that, and

1317
00:58:02.189 --> 00:58:04.147
civil servants engaged in that, and
other parts of government focused on

1318
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:04.522
other parts of government focused on
the vims.

1319
00:58:04.522 --> 00:58:05.647
other parts of government focused on
the virus. It is possible to do both

1320
00:58:05.647 --> 00:58:06.147
the vims. It is possibla to do both
at the

1321
00:58:06.147 --> 00:58:08.564
the virus. It is possible to do both
at the same time. How confident are

1322
00:58:08.564 --> 00:58:12.231
at the same time. How confident are
you will get a deal? I think both

1323
00:58:12.231 --> 00:58:14.981
you will get a deal? I think both
sides want deal, and I think right

1324
00:58:14.981 --> 00:58:15.939
sides want deal, and I think right
across Europe they realise that

1325
00:58:15.939 --> 00:58:18.689
across Europe they realise that
having a deal would make everybody’s

1326
00:58:18.689 --> 00:58:19.314
having a deal would make everybodrs
life much,

1327
00:58:19.314 --> 00:58:20.897
having a deal would make everybody’s
life much, much easier. I guess you

1328
00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:23.647
life much, much easier. I guess you
ran never say,

1329
00:58:23.647 --> 00:58:24.272
life much, much easier. I guess you
can never say, because the other

1330
00:58:24.272 --> 00:58:24.814
ran never say, because the other
thing I learnt

1331
00:58:24.814 --> 00:58:25.272
can never say, because the other
thing I learnt about Boris

1332
00:58:25.272 --> 00:58:25.481
can never say, because the other
thing I learnt about BorisJohnson

1333
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:25.814
thing I learnt about Boris johnson
it is

1334
00:58:25.814 --> 00:58:27.272
thing I learnt about BorisJohnson
it is absolute prepared to walk away

1335
00:58:27.272 --> 00:58:28.772
it is absolute prepared to walk away
in a way which our previous Prime

1336
00:58:28.772 --> 00:58:30.689
in a way which our previous Prime
Minister was not, but I think we all

1337
00:58:30.689 --> 00:58:33.272
Minister was not, but I think we all
know that, of course, life would be

1338
00:58:33.272 --> 00:58:34.272
know that, of course, life would be
easier on the 1st of

1339
00:58:34.272 --> 00:58:34.564
know that, of course, life would be
easier on the 1st ofJanuary

1340
00:58:34.564 --> 00:58:34.939
know that, of course, life would be
easier on the 1st of January with a

1341
00:58:34.939 --> 00:58:38.106
easier on the 1st of january with a
deal in place.

1342
00:58:38.106 --> 00:58:38.564
easier on the 1st of January with a
deal in place. Discussions started

1343
00:58:38.564 --> 00:58:39.939
deal in place. Discussions started
again today and we will see where

1397
01:00:29.647 --> 01:00:33.189
I don’t want to even want to speak.
This music’s way too smooth.

1398
01:00:33.189 --> 01:00:35.564
But how can sound waves physically
make you move?

1399
01:00:35.564 --> 01:00:39.522
And in return, you get experiences
you like. It lifts you high.

ASTRONAUT: "Should be coming into
view.

1401
01:00:44.106 --> 01:00:46.272
Earth’s starting to look
pretty small now.

1402
01:00:46.272 --> 01:00:48.981
I guess the world really does
turn...

MUSIC PLAYS

1404

Be moved by...

1405
01:00:58.314 --> 01:01:02.647
# Now I beg to see you dance
just one more time

1406
01:01:02.647 --> 01:01:06.231
# So dance for me, dance for me,
dance for me, oh, oh

1407
01:01:06.231 --> 01:01:09.272
# And when you’re done,
I’ll make you do it all again... #

1408
01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:11.272
It’s what we’ve all been
waiting for.

1409
01:01:11.272 --> 01:01:13.147
Strictly, the brand—new series...

1410
01:01:34.814 --> 01:01:39.856
Chris, shall we kick
off our new policy of introducing

1411
01:01:42.106 --> 01:01:44.439
our special guests by dressing up
and having appropriate props.

1412
01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:46.522
I think we should, shouldn’t we?

1413
01:01:46.522 --> 01:01:49.189
And you and I have always gone
for subtlety, in this

1414
01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:51.356
particular department,
hence my current attire

1415
01:01:51.356 --> 01:01:54.231
which will be very obvious
if you are watching on the telly

1416
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:59.231
and less obvious if you are
listening on the podcast.

1417
01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:02.647
Let mejust describe,
I have a high vizjacket on.

1418
01:02:02.647 --> 01:02:04.356
A fluorescent yellow
jacket about my person.

1419
01:02:04.356 --> 01:02:06.522
That is the first clue,
second clue, you’re going

1420
01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.231
to get it after this one.

1421
01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:10.564
I have brought a battered
old red box, the sort

1422
01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:13.939
of which you would see on budget
day, with the budget inside it.

1423
01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:16.981
And, are you getting warmer?

1424
01:02:16.981 --> 01:02:20.106
And you are in possession of a final
clue as well, aren’t you?

1425
01:02:20.106 --> 01:02:25.147
A fine newspaper,
the Evening Standard.

1426
01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:33.897
And therefore, it is pretty obvious,
I think, to keen Newscasters now,

1427
01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:36.064
that our first guest this week
is George Osborne,

1428
01:02:36.064 --> 01:02:37.022
the former Chancellor.

1429
01:02:37.022 --> 01:02:38.064
Hello, George.

1430
01:02:38.064 --> 01:02:39.106
Hello.

1431
01:02:39.106 --> 01:02:40.522
Even I can get those close!

1432
01:02:40.522 --> 01:02:43.189
When was the last time
you were in a fluorescentjacket?

1433
01:02:43.189 --> 01:02:45.814
They rather went out of fashion
on the right of politics

1434
01:02:45.814 --> 01:02:49.106
after the giletsjaunes in Paris
started to use them.

1435
01:02:49.106 --> 01:02:52.522
That was a few years ago.

1436
01:02:52.522 --> 01:02:55.064
Boris has started wearing them,
which is a sure sign

1437
01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:57.856
that we are in economic trouble.

1438
01:02:57.856 --> 01:03:00.731
You had your own custom made
hard hat, didn’t you?

1439
01:03:00.731 --> 01:03:03.939
I had a few on various
building sites.

1440
01:03:03.939 --> 01:03:09.022
You know, when the economy
is in trouble, the best thing to do

1441
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:14.564
is put the hi—vis on,
but the hat on and you know,

1442
01:03:14.564 --> 01:03:16.481
you persuade people that
things are being built.

1443
01:03:16.481 --> 01:03:19.356
The more hi—vis jackets you see
on more politicians over the next

1444
01:03:19.356 --> 01:03:22.731
year, that is a good index for how
much economic trouble we are in.

1445
01:03:22.731 --> 01:03:25.356
I varied it a bit and started
wearing various restaurant outfits

1446
01:03:25.356 --> 01:03:28.231
as I went round cooking,
you know, tandooris in Wolverhampton

1447
01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:31.647
and pizzas in Brighton
and all sorts of...

1448
01:03:31.647 --> 01:03:36.231
Oh, so even the restaurant photo op,
that has been done before?

1449
01:03:36.231 --> 01:03:40.731
We did get into making things
on camera, that enables

1450
01:03:40.731 --> 01:03:45.689
the likes of you to put
a clever voice—over on.

1451
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:51.147
You made a steak
for me once, actually.

1452
01:03:51.147 --> 01:03:52.189
In Sherwood Forest.

1453
01:03:52.189 --> 01:03:53.231
Oh, yes.

1454
01:03:53.231 --> 01:03:55.647
With the person who is now
the government Chief Whip!

1455
01:03:55.647 --> 01:03:56.689
Exactly!

1456
01:03:56.689 --> 01:04:00.314
At least one of us is doing
well out of that dinner!

1457
01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:03.147
George, thank you very much
forjoining us on newscast, we have

1458
01:04:03.147 --> 01:04:04.606
got lots to talk about tonight.

1459
01:04:04.606 --> 01:04:05.647
Great to be on.

1460
01:04:05.647 --> 01:04:06.606
Newscast.

1461
01:04:06.606 --> 01:04:07.814
Newscast, from the BBC.

1462
01:04:12.314 --> 01:04:14.106
Hello, it is Adam in the studio.

1463
01:04:14.106 --> 01:04:16.189
And Laura, in the same
studio, two metres apart,

1464
01:04:16.189 --> 01:04:17.939
slightly breathless.

1465
01:04:17.939 --> 01:04:22.939
And Chris, 20 yards down
the corridor in my socially

1466
01:04:24.606 --> 01:04:26.106
distanced [air of news as usual.

1467
01:04:26.106 --> 01:04:27.272
And George Osborne is here.

1468
01:04:27.272 --> 01:04:29.939
Not wearing hi—vis or a customised
hard hat, but looking fine

1469
01:04:29.939 --> 01:04:32.439
as it is, definitely.

1470
01:04:32.439 --> 01:04:35.314
Right, there is loads of stuff
to talk about the economy today,

1471
01:04:35.314 --> 01:04:37.689
because Rishi Sunak announced
what I am going to call

1472
01:04:37.689 --> 01:04:39.189
the pre—midwinter economic
programme, having announced

1473
01:04:39.189 --> 01:04:42.397
the economic winter programme before
and now changing it to basically

1474
01:04:42.397 --> 01:04:45.689
make it more generous,
to help businesses who are in areas

1475
01:04:45.689 --> 01:04:48.314
where there is lots of coronavirus
restrictions and also

1476
01:04:48.314 --> 01:04:52.189
to make his newJob Support Scheme
3 bit more generous.

1477
01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:53.231
Yeah.

1478
01:04:53.231 --> 01:04:55.897
In other words, he has come back
again, because the first

1479
01:04:55.897 --> 01:04:57.064
one did not do enough.

1480
01:04:57.064 --> 01:04:59.481
Shall we have a listen
to how he described it?

1481
01:04:59.481 --> 01:05:01.897
We have an economic plan that
will protect the jobs

1482
01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.022
and livelihoods of the British
people, wherever they live

1483
01:05:04.022 --> 01:05:07.314
and whatever their situation.

1484
01:05:07.314 --> 01:05:11.231
And just as we have throughout this
crisis, we will listen and respond

1485
01:05:11.231 --> 01:05:16.231
to people’s concerns
as the situation demands.

1486
01:05:16.522 --> 01:05:21.522
And I make no apology for responding
to changing circumstances.
