hunted down by tax of other people

00:06:17.328 --> 00:06:17.536
-- buy packs of other peopla. They
are

are being stabbed and aside from the

164
00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:21.369
are being stabbed and aside from the
ones who are dying, there are

165
00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:22.661
ones who are dying, there are
hundreds in this city who are being

166
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:24.536
hundreds in this city who are being
stabbed and forgive me for being

167
00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:29.536
stabbed and forgive me for being
absolutely... Blunt about this,

168
00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:29.953
absolutely. . . Blunt about this,
there is

169
00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:31.578
absolutely... Blunt about this,
there is now a thing that they do.

170
00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:35.703
there is now a thing that they do.
They stab kids in the and us so they

171
00:06:35.703 --> 00:06:40.494
They stab kids in the and us so they
have to wear colostomy bags. This is

172
00:06:40.494 --> 00:06:43.286
have to wear colostomy bags. This is
vicious, a war, and it is out of

173
00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:44.703
vicious, a war, and it is out of
control, we and the authorities seem

174
00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:46.953
control, we and the authorities seem
not to be interested except to say,

175
00:06:46.953 --> 00:06:47.453
not to be interested except to say,
'Let’s

176
00:06:47.453 --> 00:06:48.494
not to be interested except to say,
"Let’s have an argument about are

177
00:06:48.494 --> 00:06:51.536
"Let’s have an argument about are
there more police or are there more

178
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.869
there more police or are there more
cut?" Actually, everyone who knows

179
00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:55.661
cut?" Actually, everyone who knows
about that these kids are doing it

180
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:57.661
about that these kids are doing it
in a way that you would have to have

181
00:06:57.661 --> 00:06:58.828
in a way that you would have to have
North Korean levels of policing to

182
00:06:58.828 --> 00:07:00.661
North Korean levels of policing to
catch them at it. I think we have to

183
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:02.036
catch them at it. I think we have to
do some different things, first and

184
00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:03.203
do some different things, first and
we’ve got to understand what is

185
00:07:03.203 --> 00:07:04.869
we’ve got to understand what is
happening here, in the first thing

186
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:06.578
happening here, in the first thing
is, who is doing the killing and who

187
00:07:06.578 --> 00:07:08.661
is, who is doing the killing and who
is doing the dying? Let me be

188
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.869
is doing the dying? Let me be
absolutely frank and it is young

189
00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:12.036
absolutely frank and it is young
black men who are dying and by the

190
00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:12.328
black men who are dying and by the
way,

191
00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:12.578
black men who are dying and by the
“Y- young

192
00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:13.619
black men who are dying and by the
way, young black men who are doing

193
00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.578
way, young black men who are doing
the killing so we need to focus on

194
00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:18.869
the killing so we need to focus on
those communities and those areas

195
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:20.203
those communities and those areas
and not pretend that this is

196
00:07:20.203 --> 00:07:24.119
and not pretend that this is
something which is just abstract.

197
00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:26.411
something which is just abstract.
Secondly, we need to help some of

198
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:27.369
Secondly, we need to help some of
the communities where the young

199
00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.828
the communities where the young
people have come straight from war

200
00:07:29.828 --> 00:07:31.453
peopla have come straight from war
zones. In

201
00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:32.244
people have come straight from war
zones. In this area, I think

202
00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:33.869
zones. In this area, I think
everybody here will know what I’m

203
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:35.453
everybody here will know what I’m
talking about. We throw them into

204
00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:37.494
talking about. We throw them into
school... Right micro for people who

205
00:07:37.494 --> 00:07:37.869
school... Right micro for peopla who
don’t live

206
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:39.494
school... Right micro for people who
don’t live locally, the audience at

207
00:07:39.494 --> 00:07:41.578
don’t live locally, the audience at
home. London is a very mixed

208
00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:43.494
home. London is a very mixed
community, it is vibrant, all the

209
00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:45.744
community, it is vibrant, all the
rest of it and we receive, rightly,

210
00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:48.578
rest of it and we receive, rightly,
people from terrible backgrounds,

211
00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:49.661
people from terrible backgrounds,
children who have seen their

212
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:50.911
children who have seen their
relatives killed in front of them,

213
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:53.494
relatives killed in front of them,
and what do we do? We put them

214
00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:55.119
and what do we do? We put them
straight into school. We don’t help

215
00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:56.744
straight into school. We don’t help
them, we don’t give them therapy.

216
00:07:56.744 --> 00:07:58.578
them, we don’t give them therapy.
That is the kind of thing we need to

217
00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:01.911
That is the kind of thing we need to
do. We need to spend, first of all,

218
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:03.078
do. We need to spend, first of all,
locate the problem properly,

219
00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:03.203
locate the problem property,
secondly,

220
00:08:03.203 --> 00:08:04.411
locate the problem properly,
secondly, we need to spend as much

221
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:05.078
secondly, we need to spend as much
as we ran

222
00:08:05.078 --> 00:08:05.203
secondly, we need to spend as much
as we can to

223
00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:05.411
secondly, we need to spend as much
as we ran to help

224
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:07.661
secondly, we need to spend as much
as we can to help these young people

225
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:08.369
as we ran to help these young people
find a way

226
00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:09.661
as we can to help these young people
find a way through. I mean, I could

227
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:11.369
find a way through. I mean, I could
talk about this all night and I know

228
00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:12.911
talk about this all night and I know
I haven’t got the time, I feel so

229
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:14.286
I haven’t got the time, I feel so
passionately about this, I’m sorry,

230
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:17.078
passionately about this, I’m sorry,
I could go on about it. But let’s

231
00:08:17.078 --> 00:08:19.161
I could go on about it. But let’s
take this seriously and not turn

232
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:20.744
take this seriously and not turn
this... Let me pre—empt, into an

233
00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:21.286
this... Let me pre-empt, into an
argument about

234
00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:23.119
this... Let me pre—empt, into an
argument about who is going to spend

235
00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:25.119
argument about who is going to spend
more on police, that is not going to

236
00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:28.411
more on police, that is not going to
be the answer. The answer here is

237
00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:30.661
be the answer. The answer here is
recognising who is killing, who is

238
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:32.661
recognising who is killing, who is
dying, and help those people, not

239
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:32.744
dying, and help those peopla, not
some

240
00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:38.161
dying, and help those people, not
some general policy. APPLAUSE

offences recorded that then result
in a suspect being charged or

248
00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:58.703
in a suspect being charged or
summonsed, that is a record low

249
00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:00.953
summonsed, that is a record low
around just 796

250
00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:01.578
summonsed, that is a record low
around just 7% of offences. Mike,

278
00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:47.161
for you. This is my fault. This is
the fault of the police, because for

279
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.953
the fault of the police, because for
39 years, now, I have done your

280
00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.494
39 years, now, I have done your
bidding. I have done it rather well,

281
00:09:51.494 --> 00:09:52.578
bidding. I have done it rather well,
actually, I’m rather proud of

282
00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:55.369
actually, I’m rather proud of
myself. I have locked up a lot of

283
00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:57.328
myself. I have locked up a lot of
dmg dealars.

284
00:09:57.328 --> 00:09:58.203
myself. I have locked up a lot of
drug dealers. When I have locked

285
00:09:58.203 --> 00:09:59.994
dmg dealars. when I have locked
them up, I put

286
00:09:59.994 --> 00:10:00.744
drug dealers. When I have locked
them up, I put them to court and

287
00:10:00.744 --> 00:10:01.328
them up, I put them to court and
therve gone to

288
00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:02.661
them up, I put them to court and
they’ve gone to prison for a long

289
00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:03.036
therve gone to prison for a long
time but

290
00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.119
they’ve gone to prison for a long
time but two hours after I have

291
00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:07.244
time but two hours after I have
locked them up, behind my back, two

292
00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:09.494
locked them up, behind my back, two
more violent drug dealers have tried

293
00:10:09.494 --> 00:10:09.911
more violent dmg dealars have tried
to take

294
00:10:09.911 --> 00:10:14.869
more violent drug dealers have tried
to take over the patch and the most

295
00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:17.578
to take over the patch and the most
violent one has won. 50 then I go

296
00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:17.911
violent one has won. So then I go
after the

297
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:18.744
violent one has won. 50 then I go
after the most violent drug dealer

298
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:19.119
after the most violent dmg dealar
that has

299
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:19.869
after the most violent drug dealer
that has taken over from the

300
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.119
that has taken over from the
previous one and this is a Darwinian

301
00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:26.911
previous one and this is a Darwinian
spiral of violence. Then we are

302
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:30.953
spiral of violence. Then we are
quite sneaky as cops. We employ

303
00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:33.578
quite sneaky as cops. We employ
undercover police and double agents.

304
00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:34.286
undercover police and double agents.
And the dmg

305
00:10:34.286 --> 00:10:35.494
undercover police and double agents.
And the drug dealers worked out that

306
00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:36.119
And the dmg dealers worked out that
we don’t

307
00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:39.203
And the drug dealers worked out that
we don’t employ people who are 13

308
00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:39.911
we don’t employ peopla who are 13
and 14 so

309
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:40.869
we don’t employ people who are 13
and 1A so that is who they recruit

310
00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:43.828
and 14 so that is who they recmit
to do their

311
00:10:43.828 --> 00:10:45.244
and 1A so that is who they recruit
to do their bidding. The people who

312
00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:49.578
to do their bidding. The people who
deliver all the drugs that I wanted

313
00:10:49.578 --> 00:10:50.328
deliver all the drugs that I wanted
in London, principally, under

314
00:10:50.328 --> 00:10:53.619
deliver all the drugs that I wanted
in London, principally, under17.

315
00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:54.078
in London, principally, under 17.
And we

316
00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:55.286
in London, principally, under17.
And we have created that. We have

317
00:10:55.286 --> 00:10:56.619
And we have created that. We have
created that because we have done

318
00:10:56.619 --> 00:11:00.536
created that because we have done
your bidding. We are never going

319
00:11:00.536 --> 00:11:00.994
your bidding. We are never going
to... I

320
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:01.328
your bidding. We are never going
to... Iagree

321
00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:02.119
your bidding. We are never going
to... I agree with Trevor, we’re

322
00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.744
to... I agree with Trevor, we’re
never going to arrest our way out

323
00:11:03.744 --> 00:11:06.828
never going to arrest our way out
this problem. Of course, the police

324
00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:09.578
this problem. Of course, the police
have got a role to play. Of course,

325
00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:10.578
have got a rola to play. Of course,
we’ve got to

326
00:11:10.578 --> 00:11:11.161
have got a role to play. Of course,
we’ve got to investigate crime, and

327
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:14.661
we’ve got to investigate crime, and
of course, it is vital that the

328
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:16.786
of course, it is vital that the
attacks on Lena and Kate’s children

329
00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:18.869
attacks on Lena and Kate’s children
are investigated to the fullest

330
00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:21.578
are investigated to the fullest
extent, but the cuts since 2010 have

331
00:11:21.578 --> 00:11:23.411
extent, but the cuts since 2010 have
had an impact. There’s got to be a

332
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:23.578
had an impact. There’s got to be a
grown-up

333
00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:26.661
had an impact. There’s got to be a
grown—up debate about drugs. 39

334
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:27.744
grown-up debate about drugs. 39
years ago,

335
00:11:27.744 --> 00:11:28.078
grown—up debate about drugs. 39
years ago, when I

336
00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:28.578
grown—up debate about drugs. 39
years ago, when Ijoined policing,

337
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:30.536
years ago, when Ijoined policing,
most of the heroine in this country

338
00:11:30.536 --> 00:11:30.911
most of the heroine in this country
name from

339
00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:32.078
most of the heroine in this country
came from Afghanistan. It still

340
00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:34.869
came from Afghanistan. It still
does. We have got the same number of

341
00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:38.661
does. We have got the same number of
police officers but 100 times more

342
00:11:38.661 --> 00:11:39.369
police officers but100 times more
heroin coming

343
00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:42.328
police officers but 100 times more
heroin coming from Afghanistan. 50

344
00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:42.869
heroin coming from Afghanistan. So
what is

345
00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.161
heroin coming from Afghanistan. 50
what is the answer? Well, the answer

346
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:49.828
what is the answer? Well, the answer
is, it has got to be, use and social

347
00:11:49.828 --> 00:11:51.536
is, it has got to be, use and social
provision. We have got to prevent

348
00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:55.703
provision. We have got to prevent
this, we’ve got to get upstream.

349
00:11:55.703 --> 00:12:00.494
this, we’ve got to get upstream.
Sadly, the cuts to policing our own

350
00:12:00.494 --> 00:12:02.536
Sadly, the cuts to policing our own
mere shadow of the cuts to local

00:12:02.536 --> 00:12:02.661
mere shadow of the cuts to [oral

psychological effect of the past

want to know, isn’t it right for the

383
00:13:12.078 --> 00:13:17.869
want to know, isn’t it right for the
government to set out some

384
00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:19.494
government to set out some
organisation that can give advice

385
00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:20.703
organisation that ran give advice
and any way

386
00:13:20.703 --> 00:13:24.411
organisation that can give advice
and any way to help the victims? And

387
00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:30.036
and any way to help the victims? And
how are you? So so. Theresa

388
00:13:30.036 --> 00:13:31.536
how are you? So so. Theresa
Villiers, you have heard the woman

389
00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:33.036
Villiers, you have heard the woman
there speak so powerfully and also

390
00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:33.328
there speak so powerfuuy and also
what

391
00:13:33.328 --> 00:13:34.661
there speak so powerfully and also
what Mike had to say in terms of

392
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:36.161
what Mike had to say in terms of
pleasing numbers, to a certain

393
00:13:36.161 --> 00:13:39.286
pleasing numbers, to a certain
extent but nonetheless, it has made

394
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:41.244
extent but nonetheless, it has made
an impact but nothing, as he was

395
00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:42.744
an impact but nothing, as he was
sane, relative to the cuts to local

396
00:13:42.744 --> 00:13:42.953
sane, relative to the cuts to [oral
authority

397
00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:44.411
sane, relative to the cuts to local
authority budgets and we have had a

398
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:45.744
authority budgets and we have had a
Conservative government to the last

399
00:13:45.744 --> 00:13:47.994
Conservative government to the last
ten years. Well, the current

400
00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:48.994
ten years. Well, the current
situation is intolerable, the

401
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:49.494
situation is intolarable, the
upsurge in

402
00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:50.661
situation is intolerable, the
upsurge in knife crime has to be

403
00:13:50.661 --> 00:13:52.411
upsurge in knife crime has to be
dealt with and we are determined to

404
00:13:52.411 --> 00:13:54.494
dealt with and we are determined to
do that. Do you feel in part

405
00:13:54.494 --> 00:13:55.578
do that. Do you feel in part
responsible when you hear someone

406
00:13:55.578 --> 00:13:57.411
responsible when you hear someone
like Mike talk about cuts to local

407
00:13:57.411 --> 00:13:58.036
like Mike talk about cuts to [oral
authority

408
00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:00.828
like Mike talk about cuts to local
authority budgets? I believe we need

409
00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:01.536
authority budgets? I believe we need
to recmit

410
00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:02.328
authority budgets? I believe we need
to recruit 20,000 more police. We

411
00:14:02.328 --> 00:14:02.494
to recmit 20,000 more police. We
are

412
00:14:02.494 --> 00:14:03.703
to recruit 20,000 more police. We
are committed to doing that. We need

413
00:14:03.703 --> 00:14:07.078
are committed to doing that. We need
a strong police response. We have

414
00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:09.661
a strong police response. We have
strength in stop and search powers

415
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:11.619
strength in stop and search powers
which are crucial. We are giving

416
00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:12.119
which are cmcial. We are giving
police the

417
00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:13.578
which are crucial. We are giving
police the tasers they have

418
00:14:13.578 --> 00:14:15.119
police the tasers they have
requested. We are also fully

419
00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:17.453
requested. We are also fully
recognising that we need to invest

420
00:14:17.453 --> 00:14:19.119
recognising that we need to invest
more in the programme is to prevent

421
00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:21.369
more in the programme is to prevent
young people from getting involved

422
00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:21.911
young peopla from getting involved
in gangs and

423
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:22.744
young people from getting involved
in gangs and crime in the first

424
00:14:22.744 --> 00:14:28.078
in gangs and crime in the first
place. So we have got £700 million

425
00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:29.369
place. So we have got £700 million
worth of programmes planned now for

426
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:33.661
worth of programmes planned now for
exactly that. We need a dual

427
00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:34.786
exactly that. We need a dual
approach, a tough policing response

428
00:14:34.786 --> 00:14:36.911
approach, a tough policing response
to bring the perpetrators to

429
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:38.869
to bring the perpetrators to
justice, but also a really

430
00:14:38.869 --> 00:14:41.286
justice, but also a really
comprehensive route to try to ensure

431
00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:44.661
comprehensive route to try to ensure
that young people do not get

432
00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:45.994
that young people do not get
involved in this kind of cycle of

433
00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:46.244
involved in this kind of cycle of
violance

434
00:14:46.244 --> 00:14:48.828
involved in this kind of cycle of
violence in the first place, and to

435
00:14:48.828 --> 00:14:50.494
violence in the first place, and to
promote that public health approach

436
00:14:50.494 --> 00:14:52.786
promote that public health approach
which has worked so well in Glasgow

437
00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:55.328
which has worked so well in Glasgow
and many cities in the US as well.

438
00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:56.994
and many cities in the US as well.
Isn’t this just making up for the

439
00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:59.578
Isn’t this just making up for the
cuts that you have already made?

440
00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:01.536
cuts that you have already made?
Know, it’s not, I mean, if you look

441
00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:02.494
Know, it’s not, I mean, ifyou look
at the last

442
00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:03.494
Know, it’s not, I mean, if you look
at the last time this upsurge in

443
00:15:03.494 --> 00:15:05.494
at the last time this upsurge in
violent crime on the streets of

444
00:15:05.494 --> 00:15:08.619
violent crime on the streets of
London happened, that was in around

445
00:15:08.619 --> 00:15:10.536
London happened, that was in around
2008 and actually, Boris, as Mayor

446
00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:11.869
2008 and actually, Boris, as Mayor
of London, brought the murder rate

447
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.369
of London, brought the murder rate
is down by 50%. And it went down

448
00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:14.619
is down by 5096. And it went down
across

449
00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:15.494
is down by 50%. And it went down
across the country, not

450
00:15:15.494 --> 00:15:15.911
is down by 50%. And it went down
across the country, notjust in

451
00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:17.661
across the country, not just in
London. It

452
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:18.661
across the country, notjust in
London. It is possible to do this

453
00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:19.036
London. It is possibla to do this
and we

454
00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:20.078
London. It is possible to do this
and we are determined to do this

455
00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:21.536
and we are determined to do this
because we have to keep the young

456
00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:22.828
because we have to keep the young
people on the streets of this city

457
00:15:22.828 --> 00:15:24.953
people on the streets of this city
and others safe. There’s a lot of

458
00:15:24.953 --> 00:15:26.453
and others safe. There’s a lot of
hands up so Trevor, if you forgive

the peopla

465
00:15:32.494 --> 00:15:34.244
through with what Trevor said about
the people who are killing are

466
00:15:34.244 --> 00:15:34.661
the peopla who are killing are
within

467
00:15:34.661 --> 00:15:36.244
the people who are killing are
within the black community, the

468
00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:36.578
within the black community, the
peopla who

469
00:15:36.578 --> 00:15:39.494
within the black community, the
people who are dying are within the

470
00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:39.661
peopla who are dying are within the
black

471
00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:40.786
people who are dying are within the
black community. So does it mean,

472
00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:43.786
black community. So does it mean,
then, that because it is... A

473
00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:46.661
then, that because it is... A
problem belonging to particular

474
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:49.244
problem belonging to particular
section society, that the government

475
00:15:49.244 --> 00:15:52.244
section society, that the government
either doesn’t understand the need

476
00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:54.661
either doesn’t understand the need
or has become desensitised about

477
00:15:54.661 --> 00:15:58.828
or has become desensitised about
this population, this group of the

478
00:15:58.828 --> 00:16:02.286
this population, this group of the
population, who, for some reason, it

479
00:16:02.286 --> 00:16:04.494
population, who, for some reason, it
may result from a vicious cycle of

480
00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:05.661
may result from a vicious cycle of
deprivation, that no one cares to

481
00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:12.661
deprivation, that no one cares to
look into? I don’t know that

482
00:16:12.661 --> 00:16:14.036
look into? I don’t know that
listening is the answer to it, I

483
00:16:14.036 --> 00:16:15.661
listening is the answer to it, I
don’t know that the political

484
00:16:15.661 --> 00:16:16.828
don’t know that the political
argument about investment is the

485
00:16:16.828 --> 00:16:18.453
argument about investment is the
right answer to this problem. We

486
00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:20.786
right answer to this problem. We
need to look further than this.

487
00:16:20.786 --> 00:16:21.661
need to look further than this.
APPLAUSE

488
00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:23.994
APPLAUSE
We will come back to that, yes, the

489
00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:25.328
We will come back to that, yes, the
woman with the blonde hair and a

490
00:16:25.328 --> 00:16:29.828
woman with the blonde hair and a
scarf. I think you are absolutely

491
00:16:29.828 --> 00:16:31.286
scarf. I think you are absolutely
right, this problem began way before

492
00:16:31.286 --> 00:16:33.661
right, this problem began way before
cuts to the Met, it began with the

493
00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:34.828
cuts to the Met, it began with the
complete abolition of youth services

494
00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.953
complete abolition of youth services
in all the areas. We have just seen

495
00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:38.328
in all the areas. We have just seen
[oral

496
00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:39.494
in all the areas. We have just seen
local services for the youth

497
00:16:39.494 --> 00:16:39.661
[oral services for the youth
stripped

498
00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:40.536
local services for the youth
stripped out of communities and

499
00:16:40.536 --> 00:16:42.161
stripped out of communities and
young men have nowhere to go,

500
00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:44.911
young men have nowhere to go,
nowhere to turn, no support. Where

501
00:16:44.911 --> 00:16:45.536
nowhere to turn, no support. where
do they turn?

502
00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:46.578
nowhere to turn, no support. Where
do they turn? They turn to each

503
00:16:46.578 --> 00:16:48.203
do they turn? They turn to each
other, they become each other’s

504
00:16:48.203 --> 00:16:48.536
other, they become each other’s
families.

505
00:16:48.536 --> 00:16:52.703
other, they become each other’s
families. The cornerstones to young

506
00:16:52.703 --> 00:16:54.536
families. The cornerstones to young
people becoming successful adults

507
00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:54.661
peoplc becoming successful adults
are

508
00:16:54.661 --> 00:16:55.453
people becoming successful adults
are self—esteem, confidence, self

509
00:16:55.453 --> 00:16:55.661
are self-esteem, confidence, self
worth

510
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:56.911
are self—esteem, confidence, self
worth and the places where they were

511
00:16:56.911 --> 00:16:59.411
worth and the places where they were
getting that youth services and

512
00:16:59.411 --> 00:17:00.661
getting that youth services and
without that, this is where the

513
00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:04.953
without that, this is where the
problem began. The man at the back.

514
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.536
ﬂ

515
00:17:09.536 --> 00:17:14.744
I think these issues are driven by
people’s consumptions. London is the

516
00:17:14.744 --> 00:17:16.453
people’s consumptions. London is the
cocaine capital of Europe. We have

517
00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.453
cocaine capital of Europe. We have
all been to parties, I have, where

518
00:17:18.453 --> 00:17:20.119
all been to parties, I have, where
it is visibly on show and people

519
00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:20.578
it is visibly on show and peopla
have no

520
00:17:20.578 --> 00:17:24.203
it is visibly on show and people
have no qualms about using it.

521
00:17:24.203 --> 00:17:25.703
have no qualms about using it.
People who join these gangs, they

522
00:17:25.703 --> 00:17:27.828
People who join these gangs, they
see that there is money in drug

523
00:17:27.828 --> 00:17:28.161
see that there is money in dmg
dealing, so

524
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:28.994
see that there is money in drug
dealing, so maybe the government

525
00:17:28.994 --> 00:17:31.244
dealing, so maybe the government
needs to look at its drug policies

526
00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:31.994
needs to look at its dmg policies
as well.

527
00:17:31.994 --> 00:17:33.911
needs to look at its drug policies
as well. Maybe there is an option in

528
00:17:33.911 --> 00:17:35.203
as well. Maybe there is an option in
a decriminalisation model like they

529
00:17:35.203 --> 00:17:36.703
a decriminalisation model like they
have in Portugal or something which

530
00:17:36.703 --> 00:17:38.828
have in Portugal or something which
might solve it from the demand side.

531
00:17:38.828 --> 00:17:41.494
might solve it from the demand side.
Not parties I go to, but maybe I am

532
00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:45.661
Not parties I go to, but maybe I am
eating the wrong people. Trevor, I

533
00:17:45.661 --> 00:17:47.869
eating the wrong people. Trevor, I
agree with you about how it is not

534
00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:50.119
agree with you about how it is not
just police numbers, but I don’t

535
00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:50.953
just police numbers, but I don’t
think you ran

536
00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:51.328
just police numbers, but I don’t
think you can underestimate the

537
00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:52.536
think you ran underestimate the
concept of

538
00:17:52.536 --> 00:17:53.411
think you can underestimate the
concept of government’s cuts to

539
00:17:53.411 --> 00:17:55.411
concept of government’s cuts to
police numbers, because the extra

540
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:57.119
police numbers, because the extra
20,000 police officers that Boris

541
00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:57.744
20,000 police officers that Boris
johnson is

542
00:17:57.744 --> 00:17:58.828
20,000 police officers that Boris
Johnson is going to recruit will

543
00:17:58.828 --> 00:17:59.369
johnson is going to recmit will
only begin

544
00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:00.453
Johnson is going to recruit will
only begin to bring levels back to

545
00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:04.703
only begin to bring levels back to
where they were. The police number

546
00:18:04.703 --> 00:18:06.078
where they were. The police number
cuts are such a significant thing

547
00:18:06.078 --> 00:18:08.119
cuts are such a significant thing
and it has to be taken into

548
00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:09.369
and it has to be taken into
consideration, and the part that has

549
00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:16.286
consideration, and the part that has
played in knife crime. Emily. I

550
00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:17.994
played in knife crime. Emily. I
think you’re right. We are not

551
00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:18.119
played in knife crime. Emily. I
think you’re right. We are notjust

552
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:18.994
think you’re right. We are not just
talking about

553
00:18:18.994 --> 00:18:19.661
think you’re right. We are notjust
talking about because the police

554
00:18:19.661 --> 00:18:20.078
talking about berause the police
numbers,

555
00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:21.953
talking about because the police
numbers, we are also talking about

556
00:18:21.953 --> 00:18:24.411
numbers, we are also talking about
the community support officers he

557
00:18:24.411 --> 00:18:26.369
the community support officers he
used to be the eyes and ears, who

558
00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:27.036
used to be the eyes and ears, who
used to mn

559
00:18:27.036 --> 00:18:29.244
used to be the eyes and ears, who
used to run the boxing clubs in my

560
00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:29.786
used to nm the boxing clubs in my
area, who

561
00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:30.703
used to run the boxing clubs in my
area, who used to have a connection

562
00:18:30.703 --> 00:18:35.328
area, who used to have a connection
with the community. Because

563
00:18:35.328 --> 00:18:36.661
with the community. Because
communities cannot be policed.

564
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.744
communities cannot be policed.
Policing isn’t something which is

565
00:18:37.744 --> 00:18:40.119
Policing isn’t something which is
done to a community, it can only be

566
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:40.494
done to a community, it ran only be
done with

567
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:41.578
done to a community, it can only be
done with the agreement of the

568
00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:44.036
done with the agreement of the
community and you must work with the

569
00:18:44.036 --> 00:18:45.953
community and you must work with the
community. My heart goes out to you

570
00:18:45.953 --> 00:18:46.411
community. My heart goes out to you
two. I

00:18:46.578 --> 00:18:48.036
community. My heart goes out to you
two. I am a local mother as well.

573
00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:49.661
two. I am a [oral mother as well.
All three of my

574
00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:50.203
two. I am a local mother as well.
All three of my kids have been

575
00:18:50.203 --> 00:18:53.661
All three of my kids have been
mugged. They have all had their

576
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.286
mugged. They have all had their
bicycle stolen. It’s terrifying. One

577
00:18:55.286 --> 00:18:55.453
bicyda stolan. It’s terrifying. One
of

578
00:18:55.453 --> 00:18:58.453
bicycle stolen. It’s terrifying. One
of the perpetrators was taken to

579
00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:00.078
of the perpetrators was taken to
court because my daughter ran out

580
00:19:00.078 --> 00:19:04.411
court because my daughter ran out
and got a police car to arrest the

581
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:06.036
and got a police far to arrest the
person. But it is

582
00:19:06.036 --> 00:19:06.661
and got a police car to arrest the
person. But it is terrifying and it

583
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:09.869
person. But it is terrifying and it
is something we live with day—to—day

584
00:19:09.869 --> 00:19:10.203
is something we live with day-to-day
in the

585
00:19:10.203 --> 00:19:10.411
is something we live with day—to—day
in the inner

586
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:10.744
is something we live with day-to-day
in the inner city.

587
00:19:10.744 --> 00:19:11.494
is something we live with day—to—day
in the inner city. And there are

588
00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:14.619
in the inner city. And there are
levels. There are the street

589
00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:15.994
levels. There are the street
muggings, and then there are the

590
00:19:15.994 --> 00:19:16.869
muggings, and then there are the
dmg dealers

591
00:19:16.869 --> 00:19:18.161
muggings, and then there are the
drug dealers and drug gangs. As a

592
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:18.369
dmg dealars and dmg gangs. As a
[oral

593
00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:20.578
drug dealers and drug gangs. As a
local member of parliament, I have

594
00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:21.369
[oral member of partiament, I have
been to so

595
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.869
local member of parliament, I have
been to so many mothers’ houses, not

596
00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:24.578
been to so many mothers“ houses, not
just black

597
00:19:24.578 --> 00:19:24.661
been to so many mothers’ houses, not
just black mothers,

598
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:26.619
been to so many mothers’ houses, not
just black mothers, but mothers from

599
00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:29.578
just black mothers, but mothers from
all different communities, because

600
00:19:29.578 --> 00:19:30.619
all different communities, because
the gangs are actually very

601
00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:34.119
the gangs are actually very
multiracial, and I go and knock on

602
00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:35.786
multiracial, and I go and knock on
the door and I give the mum letter

603
00:19:35.786 --> 00:19:38.328
the door and I give the mum letter
and I say if you ever need me, I am

604
00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:41.578
and I say if you ever need me, I am
here and sometimes they ask me in

605
00:19:41.578 --> 00:19:42.661
here and sometimes they ask me in
immediately, and sometimes they

606
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:44.078
immediately, and sometimes they
don’t. It takes years and I continue

607
00:19:44.078 --> 00:19:46.453
don’t. It takes years and I continue
to have families that I look after

608
00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:48.536
to have families that I look after
because nobody ever gets over this.

609
00:19:48.536 --> 00:19:50.369
because nobody ever gets over this.
And not only is the life of the

610
00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:52.328
And not only is the life of the
young person who is murdered ruined

620
00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:04.078
if they get cut and go to prison,
their familrs

621
00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:04.744
if they get cut and go to prison,
their family’s lives are wrecked. We

622
00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:04.994
their familrs lives are wrecked. We
know

623
00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:06.911
their family’s lives are wrecked. We
know what the solution is. We have

624
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:08.994
know what the solution is. We have
to have more police officers and

625
00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:10.536
to have more police officers and
community police officers, but we

626
00:20:10.536 --> 00:20:12.328
community police officers, but we
also have to have more youth

627
00:20:12.328 --> 00:20:14.869
also have to have more youth
services. My borough next door has

628
00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:17.536
services. My borough next door has
had 70% cuts from government to its

629
00:20:17.536 --> 00:20:18.578
had 7096 cuts from government to its
central ground.

630
00:20:18.578 --> 00:20:19.369
had 70% cuts from government to its
central ground. Hackney has had the

631
00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:21.119
central ground. Hackney has had the
same. And what happens when you cut

632
00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:21.911
same. And what happens when you cut
back a [oral

633
00:20:21.911 --> 00:20:22.494
same. And what happens when you cut
back a local authority that much?

634
00:20:22.494 --> 00:20:23.203
hack a [oral authority that much?
They only do

635
00:20:23.203 --> 00:20:25.119
back a local authority that much?
They only do what the law says they

636
00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.536
They only do what the law says they
have to do. And because the law

637
00:20:26.536 --> 00:20:28.203
have to do. And because the law
doesn’t say they have to provide

638
00:20:28.203 --> 00:20:30.078
doesn’t say they have to provide
youth services, because they have to

639
00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:32.828
youth services, because they have to
provide social care and other things

640
00:20:32.828 --> 00:20:33.494
provide social rare and other things
like looking

641
00:20:33.494 --> 00:20:34.869
provide social care and other things
like looking after kids in care and

642
00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:35.328
like looking after kids in rare and
that sort

643
00:20:35.328 --> 00:20:37.036
like looking after kids in care and
that sort of thing, they cut

644
00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:37.453
like looking after kids in care and
that sort of thing, they cutback on

645
00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:37.828
that sort of thing, they cut back on
youth services.

646
00:20:37.828 --> 00:20:39.078
that sort of thing, they cutback on
youth services. They don’t want to,

647
00:20:39.078 --> 00:20:42.619
youth services. They don’t want to,
but they have to and then what do

648
00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:43.619
but they have to and then what do
these youngsters do, somebody else

649
00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:47.911
these youngsters do, somebody else
set? When a child gets to 11, 12,

650
00:20:47.911 --> 00:20:48.411
set? when a child gets to“, 12,
13, they want

651
00:20:48.411 --> 00:20:50.244
set? When a child gets to 11, 12,
13, they want to find a role model

652
00:20:50.244 --> 00:20:50.494
13, they want to find a rola model
outside

653
00:20:50.494 --> 00:20:51.619
13, they want to find a role model
outside the family because that is

654
00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:53.619
outside the family because that is
part of growing up. And if there

655
00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.119
part of growing up. And if there
isn’t a sports teacher or a youth

656
00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:58.619
isn’t a sports teacher or a youth
worker or a teacher who has the time

657
00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.369
worker or a teacher who has the time
for them, they will find role models

658
00:21:00.369 --> 00:21:02.286
for them, they will find role models
amongst their own age group and this

659
00:21:02.286 --> 00:21:07.994
amongst their own age group and this
is how gangs develop. I don’t

660
00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:09.328
is how gangs develop. I don’t
directly disagree with anything that

661
00:21:09.328 --> 00:21:09.411
directly disagree with anything that
peopla

662
00:21:09.411 --> 00:21:10.994
directly disagree with anything that
people have said on this panel and

663
00:21:10.994 --> 00:21:11.494
peopla have said on this panel and
in the

664
00:21:11.494 --> 00:21:13.578
people have said on this panel and
in the audience. And I appreciate

665
00:21:13.578 --> 00:21:16.744
in the audience. And I appreciate
the point about middle—class drug

666
00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:17.203
the point about middle-class dmg
takers

667
00:21:17.203 --> 00:21:19.161
the point about middle—class drug
takers who are happy to take the

668
00:21:19.161 --> 00:21:20.578
takers who are happy to take the
cocaine and not worry about who is

669
00:21:20.578 --> 00:21:25.203
cocaine and not worry about who is
supplying it. At the same time, as a

670
00:21:25.203 --> 00:21:26.911
supplying it. At the same time, as a
mother of a 19—year—old, I was

671
00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:27.078
mother of a 19-year-old, I was
relieved

672
00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:28.619
mother of a 19—year—old, I was
relieved when he got to the age of

673
00:21:28.619 --> 00:21:30.911
relieved when he got to the age of
19 because I felt he was so

674
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:31.828
19 because I felt he was so
vulnerable in the neighbourhood like

675
00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:33.786
vulnerable in the neighbourhood like
this, not far from

676
00:21:33.786 --> 00:21:34.328
vulnerable in the neighbourhood like
this, not farfrom here, where he

677
00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:35.578
this, not far from here, where he
was 14 or 15

678
00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:37.119
this, not farfrom here, where he
was 1A or 15 and I am glad he is

679
00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:37.619
was 14 or 15 and I am glad he is
finally getting

680
00:21:37.619 --> 00:21:40.369
was 1A or 15 and I am glad he is
finally getting to manhood. But in

681
00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:41.661
finally getting to manhood. But in
my area, where there have been

682
00:21:41.661 --> 00:21:45.244
my area, where there have been
several deaths, it is unquestionably

683
00:21:45.244 --> 00:21:46.369
several deaths, it is unquestionably
not just a rase

684
00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:47.661
several deaths, it is unquestionably
notjust a case of more police, but

685
00:21:47.661 --> 00:21:48.453
not just a use of more police, but
more

686
00:21:48.453 --> 00:21:50.203
notjust a case of more police, but
more visible police on the street. I

687
00:21:50.203 --> 00:21:51.244
more visible police on the street. I
hope that is what Boris

688
00:21:51.244 --> 00:21:51.578
more visible police on the street. I
hope that is what BorisJohnson

689
00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:52.786
hope that is what Boris johnson
means by an

690
00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:53.661
hope that is what BorisJohnson
means by an extra 20,000. I would

691
00:21:53.661 --> 00:21:57.453
means by an extra 20,000. I would
like to see more. At one stage, the

692
00:21:57.453 --> 00:21:58.578
like to see more. At one stage, the
police fame and

693
00:21:58.578 --> 00:21:58.828
like to see more. At one stage, the
police came and sat

694
00:21:58.828 --> 00:22:00.494
like to see more. At one stage, the
police came and satin our area

695
00:22:00.494 --> 00:22:00.661
police fame and sat in our area
where

696
00:22:00.661 --> 00:22:01.619
police came and sat in our area
where local youths congregated. They

697
00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:01.703
where [oral youths congregated. They
were

698
00:22:01.703 --> 00:22:03.536
where local youths congregated. They
were there night after night for

699
00:22:03.536 --> 00:22:05.786
were there night after night for
about a month and that finally

700
00:22:05.786 --> 00:22:06.036
about a month and that finally
dismpted

701
00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:07.578
about a month and that finally
disrupted the gangs, and they

702
00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:09.161
disrupted the gangs, and they
haven’t properly returned. It is

703
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.661
haven’t property returned. It is
still a bit

704
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:11.578
haven’t properly returned. It is
still a bit scary, but they haven’t

705
00:22:11.578 --> 00:22:13.369
still a bit scary, but they haven’t
returned two or three years on and

706
00:22:13.369 --> 00:22:16.161
returned two or three years on and
that is the importance of having

707
00:22:16.161 --> 00:22:16.411
that is the importance of having
mP5

708
00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:18.369
that is the importance of having
cops that care about communities who

709
00:22:18.369 --> 00:22:19.786
cops that rare about communities who
are

710
00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:21.078
cops that care about communities who
are determined to be there until

711
00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:22.244
are determined to be there until
they have done something about the

712
00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:27.161
they have done something about the
problem. I have also had experience

713
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:28.786
problem. I have also had experience
recently of a poor kid dying on the

714
00:22:28.786 --> 00:22:32.078
recently of a poor kid dying on the
streets near me. There was crime

715
00:22:32.078 --> 00:22:33.994
streets near me. There was crime
seem ticker tape and I went up to

716
00:22:33.994 --> 00:22:34.369
seem ticker tape and I went up to
the [oral

717
00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:35.286
seem ticker tape and I went up to
the local policeman and said, what

718
00:22:35.286 --> 00:22:35.494
the [oral policeman and said, what
has

719
00:22:35.494 --> 00:22:38.203
the local policeman and said, what
has happened? And he acted like I

720
00:22:38.203 --> 00:22:40.078
has happened? And he acted like I
was a nobody had a real nerve to ask

721
00:22:40.078 --> 00:22:41.411
was a nobody had a real nerve to ask
what was going on in my own

722
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:43.453
what was going on in my own
community. So

723
00:22:43.453 --> 00:22:44.119
what was going on in my own
community. Sol

724
00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:45.453
what was going on in my own
community. So I expect police to be

725
00:22:45.453 --> 00:22:47.703
community. So I expect police to be
polite to the people who live in the

726
00:22:47.703 --> 00:22:50.369
polite to the people who live in the
area, to discuss problems who live

727
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.453
area, to discuss problems who live
there. For

728
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:51.828
area, to discuss problems who live
there. Forall they

729
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:52.119
area, to discuss problems who live
there. For all they know,

730
00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:52.286
area, to discuss problems who live
there. Forall they know, I

731
00:22:52.286 --> 00:22:52.661
area, to discuss problems who live
there. For all they know, I could

732
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:54.536
there. For all they know, I could
have been a witness, I could have

733
00:22:54.536 --> 00:22:56.328
have been a witness, I could have
seen someone run away or put a knife

734
00:22:56.328 --> 00:22:57.328
seen someone mn away or put a knife
in the bin, but

735
00:22:57.328 --> 00:22:58.078
seen someone run away or put a knife
in the bin, but they acted like they

736
00:22:58.078 --> 00:23:00.244
in the bin, but they acted like they
didn’t want to hear from me.

737
00:23:00.244 --> 00:23:00.661
in the bin, but they acted like they
didn’t want to hearfrom me. And I

738
00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:01.369
didn’t want to hear from me. And I
think a lot

739
00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:02.661
didn’t want to hearfrom me. And I
think a lot of us feel like you can

740
00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:02.744
think a lot of us feel like you ran
increase

741
00:23:02.744 --> 00:23:06.328
think a lot of us feel like you can
increase police numbers, but are the

742
00:23:06.328 --> 00:23:08.369
increase police numbers, but are the
police actually helping us? They

743
00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:10.828
police actually helping us? They
have done in the past and I have

744
00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:12.203
have done in the past and I have
benefited from that, but not always.

745
00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:17.494
benefited from that, but not always.
I would love to see more of that

746
00:23:17.494 --> 00:23:19.244
I would love to see more of that
active policing so that you can call

747
00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:19.661
active policing so that you ran all
somebody

748
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:24.161
active policing so that you can call
somebody and ask what is going on.

749
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:29.078
somebody and ask what is going on.
Mike? If only you had been the Chief

750
00:23:29.078 --> 00:23:30.786
Mike? If only you had been the Chief
Constable in Durham, because you are

751
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:34.661
Constabla in Durham, because you are
spot on. If

752
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:35.453
Constable in Durham, because you are
spot on. If one of my police

753
00:23:35.453 --> 00:23:37.328
spot on. If one of my police
officers had been as rude to you is

754
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:38.244
officers had been as rude to you is
that, I

that, I would have been

that, I would have beenjolly

758
00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:42.703
that, I would have beenjolly
unimpressed. Policing is dead

759
00:23:42.703 --> 00:23:43.869
unimpressed. Policing is dead
straight forward, folks. We have got

760
00:23:43.869 --> 00:23:46.328
straight forward, folks. We have got
to be approachable, kind and

761
00:23:46.328 --> 00:23:49.536
to be approachable, kind and
ruthless when appropriate. But you

762
00:23:49.536 --> 00:23:50.036
mthless when appropriate. But you
have got to

763
00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:53.244
ruthless when appropriate. But you
have got to know who we are. If you

764
00:23:53.244 --> 00:23:54.786
have got to know who we are. If you
don’t know our names, how can we

765
00:23:54.786 --> 00:23:55.286
don’t know our names, how ran we
please with

766
00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:56.244
don’t know our names, how can we
please with you? When Robert Peel

767
00:23:56.244 --> 00:23:57.453
please with you? when Robert Peel
set up the

768
00:23:57.453 --> 00:23:58.203
please with you? When Robert Peel
set up the police, he said the

769
00:23:58.203 --> 00:23:59.869
set up the police, he said the
police and other public and the

770
00:23:59.869 --> 00:23:59.953
police and other public and the
pub“:

771
00:23:59.953 --> 00:24:04.578
police and other public and the
public are the police. We are not an

772
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:05.869
public are the police. We are not an
army of occupation. Sadly, if police

773
00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:10.119
army of occupation. Sadly, if police
officers feel beleaguered, then

774
00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:11.619
officers feel beleaguered, then
sometimes you do get those

775
00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:12.703
sometimes you do get those
dysfunctional relationships. You

776
00:24:12.703 --> 00:24:13.744
dysfunctional relationships. You
have got to have neighbourhood

777
00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:15.828
have got to have neighbourhood
police officers and hopefully a

778
00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:16.036
police officers and hopefully a
loral

779
00:24:16.036 --> 00:24:18.661
police officers and hopefully a
local police station where you know

780
00:24:18.661 --> 00:24:18.828
[oral police station where you know
their

781
00:24:18.828 --> 00:24:20.203
local police station where you know
their names and they are on patrol

782
00:24:20.203 --> 00:24:24.286
their names and they are on patrol
with PCSOs. Those offices and PCSOs

783
00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:24.661
with P605. Those offices and P605
have to

784
00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:26.203
with PCSOs. Those offices and PCSOs
have to have a spring in their step.

785
00:24:26.203 --> 00:24:27.494
have to have a spring in their step.
One of the things that inspectors

786
00:24:27.494 --> 00:24:30.286
One of the things that inspectors
always said when they came to Durham

787
00:24:30.286 --> 00:24:32.328
always said when they came to Durham
was, gosh, it feels different here.

788
00:24:32.328 --> 00:24:35.328
was, gosh, it feels different here.
You have to engender that feeling

789
00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:35.994
You have to engender that feeling
that you ran

790
00:24:35.994 --> 00:24:36.744
You have to engender that feeling
that you can do something. Let’s not

791
00:24:36.744 --> 00:24:36.953
that you ran do something. Let’s not
be

792
00:24:36.953 --> 00:24:41.578
that you can do something. Let’s not
be fatalistic. You asked me what we

793
00:24:41.578 --> 00:24:45.536
be fatalistic. You asked me what we
did, Fiona. We arrest people, but we

794
00:24:45.536 --> 00:24:45.786
did, Fiona. We arrest peopla, but we
don’t

795
00:24:45.786 --> 00:24:46.994
did, Fiona. We arrest people, but we
don’t necessarily prosecute. If

796
00:24:46.994 --> 00:24:48.661
don’t necessarily prosecute. If
somebody has been stabbed, then

797
00:24:48.661 --> 00:24:48.994
somebody has been stabbed, then
dearty that

798
00:24:48.994 --> 00:24:50.619
somebody has been stabbed, then
clearly that goes to court, but I’m

799
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:51.953
dearty that goes to court, but I’m
talking about

800
00:24:51.953 --> 00:24:52.369
clearly that goes to court, but I’m
talking about the precursor

801
00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:54.411
talking about the precursor
behaviour. We all know about adverse

802
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:58.578
behaviour. We all know about adverse
child experiences. So in Durham,

803
00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:00.536
child experiences. So in Durham,
there is something called the mini

804
00:25:00.536 --> 00:25:01.244
there is something railed the mini
police at

805
00:25:01.244 --> 00:25:01.453
there is something called the mini
police at every

806
00:25:01.453 --> 00:25:02.369
there is something called the mini
police at everyjunior school now.

807
00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:02.828
police at every junior school now.
And we

808
00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:03.786
police at everyjunior school now.
And we make sure the most

809
00:25:03.786 --> 00:25:06.244
And we make sure the most
disadvantaged kids are part of that

810
00:25:06.244 --> 00:25:08.328
disadvantaged kids are part of that
with the police uniform. They learn

811
00:25:08.328 --> 00:25:10.578
with the police uniform. They learn
about social cohesion. And it isn’t

812
00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:12.786
about social cohesion. And it isn’t
twee, its hard—hitting and has a

813
00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:15.203
twee, its hard-hitting and has a
major impact.

814
00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:15.911
twee, its hard—hitting and has a
major impact. Those children have

815
00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:17.286
major impact. Those children have
got civic values for the rest of

816
00:25:17.286 --> 00:25:21.869
got civic values for the rest of
their lives. Trevor? I

817
00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:22.244
got civic values for the rest of
their lives. Trevor? lam

818
00:25:22.244 --> 00:25:22.578
got civic values for the rest of
their lives. Trevor? I am going to

819
00:25:22.578 --> 00:25:24.661
their lives. Trevor? I am going to
put back on a couple of things. I

820
00:25:24.661 --> 00:25:27.453
put back on a couple of things. I
don’t want drugs in my city. I would

821
00:25:27.453 --> 00:25:29.328
don’t want drugs in my city. I would
like to have more police officers,

822
00:25:29.328 --> 00:25:30.661
like to have more police officers,
but we are talking about a specific

823
00:25:30.661 --> 00:25:34.786
but we are talking about a specific
thing. Three young men will die

824
00:25:34.786 --> 00:25:37.661
thing. Three young men will die
before this programme is broadcast

825
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:40.536
before this programme is broadcast
again, and we know what they look

826
00:25:40.536 --> 00:25:42.869
again, and we know what they look
like, we know what part of the city

827
00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:45.078
like, we know what part of the city
they come from. And we also know

828
00:25:45.078 --> 00:25:46.036
they come from. And we also know
that it isn’t about something

829
00:25:46.036 --> 00:25:50.453
that it isn’t about something
happening externally. Talk to these

830
00:25:50.453 --> 00:25:51.911
happening externally. Talk to these
kids and they will tell you about

831
00:25:51.911 --> 00:25:56.661
kids and they will tell you about
beef. They will tell you about the

832
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.869
beef. They will tell you about the
insane reasons these things happen,

833
00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:00.619
insane reasons these things happen,
which are outside the can of people

834
00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:01.369
which are outside the ran of peopla
on this panel

835
00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:02.286
which are outside the can of people
on this panel and people in the

836
00:26:02.286 --> 00:26:07.369
on this panel and people in the
audience. We need to understand what

837
00:26:07.369 --> 00:26:12.328
audience. We need to understand what
they are doing and why. If I had a

838
00:26:12.328 --> 00:26:14.661
they are doing and why. If I had a
son, he would be well off, but I bet

839
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:16.036
son, he would be well off, but I bet
he would stand a good chance of

840
00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:18.369
he would stand a good chance of
being involved in this kind of thing

841
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.078
being involved in this kind of thing
too. There are two practical things

842
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:24.328
too. There are two practical things
we could do. First, I would like to

843
00:26:24.328 --> 00:26:25.244
we could do. First, I would like to
see somebody stop glorifying the

844
00:26:25.244 --> 00:26:30.661
see somebody stop glorifying the
culture and the music and all of

845
00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:33.661
culture and the music and all of
that that does drill, guns, kill,

846
00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:34.786
that that does drill, guns, kill,
kill, kill, and disrespects women.

847
00:26:34.786 --> 00:26:37.536
kill, kill, and disrespects women.
We make heroes of the people who

848
00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:39.953
We make heroes of the people who
make this music. I need to be blunt

849
00:26:39.953 --> 00:26:41.578
make this music. I need to be blunt
about that. That is one of the

850
00:26:41.578 --> 00:26:43.536
about that. That is one of the
reasons that young people are into

851
00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:43.828
reasons that young peopla are into
it. The

852
00:26:43.828 --> 00:26:47.036
reasons that young people are into
it. The second thing we could do, we

853
00:26:47.036 --> 00:26:47.494
it. The second thing we could do, we
ran handle

854
00:26:47.494 --> 00:26:48.411
it. The second thing we could do, we
can handle the police, but that will

855
00:26:48.411 --> 00:26:48.619
ran handla the police, but that will
take

856
00:26:48.619 --> 00:26:49.661
can handle the police, but that will
take time. Across the road from

857
00:26:49.661 --> 00:26:52.244
take time. Across the road from
here, there is a park. My mum pushed

858
00:26:52.244 --> 00:26:54.661
here, there is a park. My mum pushed
me around it as a baby. Nobody will

859
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:57.536
me around it as a baby. Nobody will
walk across that part tonight,

860
00:26:57.536 --> 00:26:58.744
walk across that part tonight,
Clissold Park, because it is too

861
00:26:58.744 --> 00:26:59.869
dissold Park, because it is too
dangerous.

862
00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:01.994
Clissold Park, because it is too
dangerous. One of the reasons is

863
00:27:01.994 --> 00:27:04.119
dangerous. One of the reasons is
that we have public spaces now which

864
00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:07.036
that we have public spaces now which
is to be the province of

865
00:27:07.036 --> 00:27:07.203
that we have public spaces now which
is to be the province ofjanitors

866
00:27:07.203 --> 00:27:08.953
is to be the province ofjanitors
and park keepers and schools would

867
00:27:08.953 --> 00:27:11.203
and park keepers and schools would
have teaching assistants who would

868
00:27:11.203 --> 00:27:13.244
have teaching assistants who would
work with people. In Hackney, that

869
00:27:13.244 --> 00:27:13.619
work with peopla. In Hackney, that
is something

870
00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:15.911
work with people. In Hackney, that
is something that a successful

871
00:27:15.911 --> 00:27:17.078
is something that a successful
school did. Maybe one thing you

872
00:27:17.078 --> 00:27:18.953
school did. Maybe one thing you
could do is invest in bringing back

873
00:27:18.953 --> 00:27:21.453
could do is invest in bringing back
some of those intermediate

874
00:27:21.453 --> 00:27:24.203
some of those intermediate
professionals, not the big deal, but

875
00:27:24.203 --> 00:27:25.786
professionals, not the big deal, but
people who are just there, because

876
00:27:25.786 --> 00:27:27.078
people who are just there, because
these things happen in places where

877
00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:30.828
these things happen in places where
nobody is watching. The more we can

878
00:27:30.828 --> 00:27:32.494
nobody is watching. The more we ran
have those park

879
00:27:32.494 --> 00:27:33.161
nobody is watching. The more we can
have those park keepers and janitors

880
00:27:33.161 --> 00:27:35.619
have those park keepers and janitors
back, the people who are around, the

881
00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:36.036
back, the peopla who are around, the
more likely

882
00:27:36.036 --> 00:27:37.536
back, the people who are around, the
more likely we are to protect our

883
00:27:37.536 --> 00:27:39.661
more likely we are to protect our
kids. Do the simple thing first. I’m

884
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:42.953
kids. Do the simple thing first. I’m
going to move on, but I want to come

885
00:27:42.953 --> 00:27:48.744
going to move on, but I want to come
back to you, Lena. I know about 30

886
00:27:48.744 --> 00:27:49.244
back to you, Lena. I know about 30
peopla who

887
00:27:49.244 --> 00:27:50.036
back to you, Lena. I know about 30
people who have been mugged in

888
00:27:50.036 --> 00:27:51.203
people who have been mugged in
Clissold Park and through this

889
00:27:51.203 --> 00:27:54.036
Clissold Park and through this
community network that I am part of.

890
00:27:54.036 --> 00:27:57.869
community network that I am part of.
I have seen two policemen wants

891
00:27:57.869 --> 00:27:59.828
I have seen two policemen wants
patrolling. We are communicating

892
00:27:59.828 --> 00:28:00.911
patrolling. We are communicating
with the authorities through this

893
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:03.911
with the authorities through this
network that I am part of and we

894
00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:05.203
network that I am part of and we
tell them and encourage people to

895
00:28:05.203 --> 00:28:07.786
tell them and encourage people to
report. But

896
00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:08.036
tell them and encourage people to
report. Butl

897
00:28:08.036 --> 00:28:09.619
tell them and encourage people to
report. But I have only once seen

898
00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:17.536
report. But I have only once seen
any police there. The other thing is

899
00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:20.619
any police there. The other thing is
that there is evidence that says the

900
00:28:20.619 --> 00:28:21.869
that there is evidence that says the
increase in exclusion from school is

901
00:28:21.869 --> 00:28:24.786
increase in exclusion from school is
tied to the increase in street

902
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:29.244
tied to the increase in street
crime, so we are excluding more and

903
00:28:29.244 --> 00:28:30.286
crime, so we are excluding more and
more and schools are becoming

904
00:28:30.286 --> 00:28:35.036
more and schools are becoming
stricter. That is a question for the

905
00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:38.328
stricter. That is a question for the
Tory government. If you will forgive

906
00:28:38.328 --> 00:28:40.161
Tory government. If you will forgive
me, I’m going to take another

907
00:28:40.161 --> 00:28:43.244
me, I’m going to take another
question, but thank you for your

908
00:28:43.244 --> 00:28:46.244
question, but thank you for your
contribution. Before I do, next week

909
00:28:46.244 --> 00:28:47.703
contribution. Before I do, next week
we will be the Derbyshire spa town

910
00:28:47.703 --> 00:28:50.286
we will be the Derbyshire spa town
of Buxton. The week after, we will

911
00:28:50.286 --> 00:28:51.619
of Buxton. The week after, we will
be in Hertfordshire. If you want to

912
00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:53.119
be in Hertfordshire. If you want to
be in the audience, call.

913
00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:00.703
Let’s ta ke

914
00:29:00.703 --> 00:29:06.411
Let’s take another question now from
Phil Connolley.

915
00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:06.661
F.

916
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:06.786
Isa

917
00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:11.244
Is a potential trade agreement with
the US knowing jeopardy as a result

918
00:29:11.244 --> 00:29:17.203
the US knowing jeopardy as a result
of the new digital tax?

919
00:29:19.078 --> 00:29:22.328
of the new digital tax? We had the
Chancellor say he is introducing a

920
00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:24.161
Chancellor say he is introducing a
new digital tax in April. We also

921
00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:26.411
new digital tax in April. We also
had the USA if you do that, we will

922
00:29:26.411 --> 00:29:28.078
had the USA if you do that, we will
slap a tariff on your cuts. Are you

923
00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:31.661
slap a tariff on your cuts. Are you
going to go ahead? We are going to

924
00:29:31.661 --> 00:29:32.161
goin
go 9 to go ah
ead? w
e are
goin
9 to

925
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.244
going to go ahead? We are going to
go ahead with our digital services

926
00:29:34.244 --> 00:29:36.494
go ahead with our digital services
tax. I believe it is vital that big

927
00:29:36.494 --> 00:29:37.244
tax. I believe it is vital that big
international businesses pay their

928
00:29:37.244 --> 00:29:42.161
international businesses pay their
taxes. We have been working on this

929
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:44.953
taxes. We have been working on this
for many years at an international

930
00:29:44.953 --> 00:29:47.244
for many years at an international
level, and solving it at an

931
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:48.411
level, and solving it at an
international level is the best way

932
00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:52.161
international level is the best way
to do it. But that is taking so long

933
00:29:52.161 --> 00:29:55.244
to do it. But that is taking so long
that we have to act domestically

934
00:29:55.244 --> 00:29:58.619
that we have to act domestically
now. Even if the US carries out its

935
00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:02.078
now. Even if the US carries out its
threat, which it has on whiskey, as

936
00:30:02.078 --> 00:30:06.536
threat, which it has on whiskey, as
you know. Even if the US makes good

937
00:30:06.536 --> 00:30:10.203
you know. Even if the US makes good
on this threat? We export one in

938
00:30:10.203 --> 00:30:11.369
on this threat? We export one in
five tars

939
00:30:11.369 --> 00:30:12.911
on this threat? We export one in
five cars to the US, it is worth

940
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:14.536
five cars to the US, it is worth
over £7 billion a year, but you will

941
00:30:14.536 --> 00:30:17.036
over £7 billion a year, but you will
still go ahead with this tax? The

942
00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:19.244
still go ahead with this tax? The
digital services tax is the right

943
00:30:19.244 --> 00:30:21.744
digital services tax is the right
thing to do. We decide our taxes,

944
00:30:21.744 --> 00:30:23.661
thing to do. We decide our taxes,
not the US. But you want to do a

945
00:30:23.661 --> 00:30:25.619
not the US. But you want to do a
trade deal with them. That was the

946
00:30:25.619 --> 00:30:28.619
trade deal with them. That was the
idea of Brexit. Is it worth a tariff

947
00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:33.536
idea of Brexit. Is it worth a tariff
on cars? There is right for public

948
00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:36.203
on cars? There is right for public
concern about aggressive tax

949
00:30:36.203 --> 00:30:37.036
concern about aggressive tax
avoidance schemes by large

950
00:30:37.036 --> 00:30:40.786
avoidance schemes by large
multinational companies. Those which

951
00:30:40.786 --> 00:30:41.869
multinational companies. Those which
are economically active in this

952
00:30:41.869 --> 00:30:43.244
are economically active in this
country should pay their fair share

953
00:30:43.244 --> 00:30:44.869
country should pay their fair share
of taxes, not least because these

954
00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:49.119
of taxes, not least because these
businesses are competing with our

955
00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:49.619
businesses are competing with our
[oral high

956
00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:50.411
businesses are competing with our
local high streets, with small

957
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.411
local high streets, with small
businesses having to pay business

958
00:30:52.411 --> 00:30:54.828
businesses having to pay business
rates. It’s time these big companies

959
00:30:54.828 --> 00:30:55.661
rates. It’s time these big companies
paid their fair

960
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:55.828
rates. It’s time these big companies
paid theirfair share

961
00:30:55.828 --> 00:30:56.036
rates. It’s time these big companies
paid theirfairshare and

962
00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:56.286
rates. It’s time these big companies
paid theirfair share and this

963
00:30:56.286 --> 00:30:57.953
paid their fair share and this
digital

964
00:30:57.953 --> 00:30:59.619
paid theirfair share and this
digital services tax in a further

965
00:30:59.619 --> 00:31:01.244
digital services tax in a further
step to making sure that that

966
00:31:01.244 --> 00:31:04.578
step to making sure that that
happens. Emily? I

967
00:31:04.578 --> 00:31:04.744
step to making sure that that
happens. Emily? Iagree

968
00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:09.994
step to making sure that that
happens. Emily? I agree with you!

969
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:12.203
happens. Emily? I agree with you! I

970
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:12.578
happens. Emily? Iagree with you! I
think it’s

971
00:31:12.578 --> 00:31:15.453
happens. Emily? I agree with you! I
think it’s outrageous. If you look

972
00:31:15.453 --> 00:31:17.494
think it’s outrageous. If you look
at the so called prophets that

973
00:31:17.494 --> 00:31:18.703
at the so called prophets that
Starbucks make, for goodness’ sake,

974
00:31:18.703 --> 00:31:19.161
Starbucks make, for goodness“ sake,
look at

975
00:31:19.161 --> 00:31:21.661
Starbucks make, for goodness’ sake,
look at the number of stores they

976
00:31:21.661 --> 00:31:23.078
look at the number of stores they
have up and down the country and

977
00:31:23.078 --> 00:31:25.661
have up and down the country and
then look at the amount of profit

978
00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:27.161
then look at the amount of profit
they claim they make. They are

979
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:29.411
they claim they make. They are
taking the Mickey. Taxes should be

980
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:31.994
taking the Mickey. Taxes should be
something that everybody pays. When

981
00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:33.661
something that everybody pays. When
Starbucks employ someone, they are

982
00:31:33.661 --> 00:31:34.661
Starbucks employ someone, they are
employing someone who has been

983
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:36.119
employing someone who has been
educated thanks to our taxes. They

984
00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:37.661
educated thanks to our taxes. They
walk down the same streets that we

985
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:39.661
walk down the same streets that we
have paid for, why aren’t they

986
00:31:39.661 --> 00:31:39.828
have paid for, why aren’t they
paving

987
00:31:39.828 --> 00:31:46.161
have paid for, why aren’t they
paying for it? It is about time. I

988
00:31:46.161 --> 00:31:48.661
paying for it? It is about time. I
agree with the frustration that we

989
00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:48.869
agree with the fmstration that we
should

990
00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:49.661
agree with the frustration that we
should be dealing with this

991
00:31:49.661 --> 00:31:52.453
should be dealing with this
internationally. Of course that is

992
00:31:52.453 --> 00:31:53.786
internationally. Of course that is
the way to deal with these

993
00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:54.703
the way to deal with these
international companies who will

994
00:31:54.703 --> 00:31:58.744
international companies who will
play off one country against

995
00:31:58.744 --> 00:32:00.744
play off one country against
another. We have to control these

996
00:32:00.744 --> 00:32:02.203
another. We have to control these
international companies, but if it

997
00:32:02.203 --> 00:32:04.494
international companies, but if it
is not happening, we can’t

998
00:32:04.494 --> 00:32:04.911
international companies, but if it
is not happening, we can’tjust keep

999
00:32:04.911 --> 00:32:05.869
is not happening, we can’t just keep
waiting. So do

1000
00:32:05.869 --> 00:32:06.911
is not happening, we can’tjust keep
waiting. 50 do you think the car

1001
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:09.453
waiting. 50 do you think the car
manufacturers will thank you for

1002
00:32:09.453 --> 00:32:11.078
manufacturers will thank you for
that? Frankly, 50% of our pages with

1003
00:32:11.078 --> 00:32:12.119
that? Frankly, 5096 of our pages with
the European

1004
00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:12.869
that? Frankly, 50% of our pages with
the European Union and our primary

1005
00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:14.036
the European Union and our primary
concern should be making sure we

1006
00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:15.578
concern should be making sure we
have a trade deal with the European

1007
00:32:15.578 --> 00:32:17.578
have a trade deal with the European
Union between now and the end of the

1008
00:32:17.578 --> 00:32:17.828
Union between now and the end of the
year. Boris

1009
00:32:17.828 --> 00:32:18.661
Union between now and the end of the
year. BorisJohnson claims he will

1010
00:32:18.661 --> 00:32:19.119
year. Boris johnson claims he will
be able

1011
00:32:19.119 --> 00:32:19.494
year. BorisJohnson claims he will
be able to

1012
00:32:19.494 --> 00:32:19.661
year. Boris johnson claims he will
be able to get

1013
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:21.078
year. BorisJohnson claims he will
be able to get that trade deal done.

1014
00:32:21.078 --> 00:32:25.119
be able to get that trade deal done.
I think most rightly thinking people

1015
00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:25.244
I think most rightly thinking peopla
think

1016
00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:26.453
I think most rightly thinking people
think this is fantasy on his part

1017
00:32:26.453 --> 00:32:29.828
think this is fantasy on his part
and he won’t be able to get it done.

1018
00:32:29.828 --> 00:32:31.244
and he won’t be able to get it done.
And attach to our leaving the

1019
00:32:31.244 --> 00:32:32.661
And attach to our leaving the
European Union is that there are 60

1020
00:32:32.661 --> 00:32:34.661
European Union is that there are 60
other countries with whom we have

1021
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:35.619
other countries with whom we have
trade deals through A0 other

1022
00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:37.369
trade deals through A0 other
agreements and if we are leaving the

1023
00:32:37.369 --> 00:32:38.786
agreements and if we are leaving the
European Union, we will not only

1024
00:32:38.786 --> 00:32:40.328
European Union, we will not only
have the trade deal with the

1025
00:32:40.328 --> 00:32:41.578
have the trade deal with the
European Union, but we were also

1026
00:32:41.578 --> 00:32:43.953
European Union, but we were also
made the trade deals with the other

1027
00:32:43.953 --> 00:32:45.411
made the trade deals with the other
60 countries. We don’t have a trade

1028
00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:46.703
60 countries. We don’t have a trade
deal with the United States and have

1029
00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:48.911
deal with the United States and have
been trading with them a lot in any

1030
00:32:48.911 --> 00:32:52.244
been trading with them a lot in any
event. So when we are always being

1031
00:32:52.244 --> 00:32:54.203
event. So when we are always being
told, don’t worry about Europe,

1032
00:32:54.203 --> 00:32:54.619
told, don’t worry about Europe,
Donald Tmmp

1033
00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:55.619
told, don’t worry about Europe,
Donald Trump will save us, I don’t

1034
00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:57.828
Donald Tmmp will save us, I don’t
believe it.

1035
00:32:57.828 --> 00:32:59.119
Donald Trump will save us, I don’t
believe it. He keeps telling us he

1036
00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:02.036
believe it. He keeps telling us he
is a great deal—maker. We have yet

1037
00:33:02.036 --> 00:33:03.078
is a great deal-maker. We have yet
to see one

1038
00:33:03.078 --> 00:33:03.286
is a great deal—maker. We have yet
to see one on

1039
00:33:03.286 --> 00:33:03.536
is a great deal-maker. We have yet
to see one on any

1040
00:33:03.536 --> 00:33:04.328
is a great deal—maker. We have yet
to see one on any level. Where is

1041
00:33:04.328 --> 00:33:04.911
to see one on any lavel. where is
the deal of

1042
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:05.828
to see one on any level. Where is
the deal of the century he was

1043
00:33:05.828 --> 00:33:07.036
the deal of the century he was
supposed to do in Israel and

1044
00:33:07.036 --> 00:33:08.661
supposed to do in Israel and
Palestine? It is all

1045
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:11.328
supposed to do in Israel and
Palestine? It is alljust hot air

1046
00:33:11.328 --> 00:33:11.744
Palestine? It is all just hot air
and he

1047
00:33:11.744 --> 00:33:12.744
Palestine? It is alljust hot air
and he doesn’t come with these deals

1048
00:33:12.744 --> 00:33:14.994
and he doesn’t come with these deals
at all. We should just make sure we

1049
00:33:14.994 --> 00:33:16.161
at all. We should just make sure we
are getting people to pay their

1050
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:21.119
are getting peopla to pay their
taxes.

1051
00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:27.369
The man in the middle. Emily has
made some of the point that I was

1052
00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:28.744
made some of the point that I was
going to make, the threat to the

1053
00:33:28.744 --> 00:33:31.953
going to make, the threat to the
same trade deal with the United

1054
00:33:31.953 --> 00:33:32.994
same trade deal with the United
States, the climate denying stable

1055
00:33:32.994 --> 00:33:34.453
States, the climate denying stable
genius that is Donald Trump and I

1056
00:33:34.453 --> 00:33:34.953
genius that is Donald Tmmp and I
think if

1057
00:33:34.953 --> 00:33:35.953
genius that is Donald Trump and I
think if anything is going to derail

1058
00:33:35.953 --> 00:33:38.161
think if anything is going to derail
a trade deal, it will be him. He

1059
00:33:38.161 --> 00:33:43.619
a trade deal, it will be him. He
woman in the red top. Well, other

1060
00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:45.119
woman in the red top. Well, other
countries are already doing it,

1061
00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:46.911
countries are already doing it,
France and Spain, some of the Asian

1062
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:50.953
France and Spain, some of the Asian
country. Doing what? In terms of

1063
00:33:50.953 --> 00:33:52.828
country. Doing what? In terms of
introducing this tax. Right, well,

1064
00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:54.828
introducing this tax. Right, well,
France is delaying its. But they are

1065
00:33:54.828 --> 00:33:57.119
France is delaying its. But they are
going to introduce it and the OECD

1066
00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.994
going to introduce it and the OECD
eventually will do it. So it should

1067
00:33:58.994 --> 00:34:01.328
eventually will do it. So it should
be an international agreement?

1068
00:34:01.328 --> 00:34:03.369
be an international agreement?
Donald Trump cannot have a hissy fit

1069
00:34:03.369 --> 00:34:03.828
Donald Tmmp cannot have a hissy fit
with everyone

1070
00:34:03.828 --> 00:34:04.994
Donald Trump cannot have a hissy fit
with everyone so we might as well go

1071
00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:06.578
with everyone so we might as well go
ahead. All right, the woman at the

1072
00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:11.369
ahead. All right, the woman at the
with the glasses. We know how Donald

1073
00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:11.578
with the glasses. We know how Donald
Tmmp

1074
00:34:11.578 --> 00:34:12.369
with the glasses. We know how Donald
Trump operates, he is very

1075
00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:16.036
Trump operates, he is very
transactional. Because there is

1076
00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:19.369
transactional. Because there is
alignment across other countries on

1077
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:20.078
alignment across other countries on
digital tax, he

1078
00:34:20.078 --> 00:34:20.369
alignment across other countries on
digitaltax, he might

1079
00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:21.161
alignment across other countries on
digital tax, he might expect to lose

1080
00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:23.203
digital tax, he might expect to lose
on that or give on that. How do we

1081
00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:28.119
on that or give on that. How do we
know that the Tory government will

1082
00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:29.119
know that the Tory government will
say, in exchange for taxing

1083
00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:32.411
say, in exchange for taxing
technology companies, sacrifice the

1084
00:34:32.411 --> 00:34:35.161
technology companies, sacrifice the
NHS, perhaps, allow privatisation? I

1085
00:34:35.161 --> 00:34:38.203
NHS, perhaps, allow privatisation? I
will come back to you on that

1086
00:34:38.203 --> 00:34:39.494
will come back to you on that
commentaries about let me get around

1087
00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:43.036
commentaries about let me get around
the panel, Sarah. I love America,

1088
00:34:43.036 --> 00:34:44.786
the panel, Sarah. I love America,
I’m half American but I don’t

1089
00:34:44.786 --> 00:34:47.494
I’m half American but I don’t
believe even the hardest of hard

Brexiteers voted to leave the

1091
00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:49.453
Brexiteers voted to leave the
European Union

1092
00:34:49.453 --> 00:34:49.661
Brexiteers voted to leave the
European Unionjust

1093
00:34:49.661 --> 00:34:49.869
Brexiteers voted to leave the
European Union just to

1094
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:50.744
Brexiteers voted to leave the
European Unionjust to become

1095
00:34:50.744 --> 00:34:51.953
European Unionjust to become
America’s poodle. I don’t think it

1096
00:34:51.953 --> 00:34:52.369
America’s poodla. I don’t think it
would be

1097
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:54.578
America’s poodle. I don’t think it
would be a good look for Boris

1098
00:34:54.578 --> 00:34:55.161
would be a good look for Boris
johnson to

1099
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:55.953
would be a good look for Boris
Johnson to be saying yes to

1100
00:34:55.953 --> 00:34:56.411
johnson to be saying yes to
everything

1101
00:34:56.411 --> 00:34:57.203
Johnson to be saying yes to
everything Donald Trump asks for

1102
00:34:57.203 --> 00:34:59.161
everything Donald Trump asks for
because he is the kind of President

1103
00:34:59.161 --> 00:35:03.203
because he is the kind of President
that will just ask for more. So

1104
00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:03.578
because he is the kind of President
that willjust ask for more. So we

1105
00:35:03.578 --> 00:35:04.161
that will just ask for more. So we
are a sovereign

1106
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:06.036
that willjust ask for more. So we
are a sovereign nation. We ought to

1107
00:35:06.036 --> 00:35:07.828
are a sovereign nation. We ought to
be able to chew gum and walk at the

1108
00:35:07.828 --> 00:35:09.369
be able to chew gum and walk at the
same time, we are going to have to

1109
00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:11.244
same time, we are going to have to
make deals all over the world, with

1110
00:35:11.244 --> 00:35:13.161
make deals all over the world, with
the European Union because they are

1111
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:14.203
the European Union because they are
our closest partner, with America

1112
00:35:14.203 --> 00:35:15.994
our closest partner, with America
because we have always had a very

1113
00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:18.953
because we have always had a very
good trading relationship with the

1114
00:35:18.953 --> 00:35:21.411
good trading relationship with the
US, and I think it has got rather

1115
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:26.328
US, and I think it has got rather
over

1116
00:35:27.786 --> 00:35:29.953
over complicated by Remainers
insisting it is all going to be a

1117
00:35:29.953 --> 00:35:30.953
insisting it is all going to be a
disaster, we will have chlorinated

1118
00:35:30.953 --> 00:35:33.036
disaster, we will have chlorinated
chicken which I’ve eaten for years

1119
00:35:33.036 --> 00:35:35.119
chicken which I’ve eaten for years
without any effect whatsoever from

1120
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:37.369
without any effect whatsoever from
the US or conversely that Brexiteers

1121
00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:37.578
the US or conversely that Brexiteers
55V

1122
00:35:37.578 --> 00:35:40.244
the US or conversely that Brexiteers
say we must not have any links left

1123
00:35:40.244 --> 00:35:41.161
say we must not have any links left
with the European Union. Let’s

1124
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:42.494
say we must not have any links left
with the European Union. Let’sjust

1125
00:35:42.494 --> 00:35:43.161
with the European Union. Let’s just
dial it down,

1126
00:35:43.161 --> 00:35:44.036
with the European Union. Let’sjust
dial it down, we are leaving the

1127
00:35:44.036 --> 00:35:45.619
dial it down, we are leaving the
European Union very soon and we have

1128
00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:47.994
European Union very soon and we have
to have good trade with everybody.

1129
00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:49.619
to have good trade with everybody.
Actually, I think there will end up

1130
00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:51.619
Actually, I think there will end up
being a lot of tough talk but

1131
00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:54.161
being a lot of tough talk but
goodwill in the end. That is very

1132
00:35:54.161 --> 00:35:57.119
goodwill in the end. That is very
sensible, maybe a little too

1133
00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:59.578
sensible, maybe a little too
pragmatic but that is how...

1134
00:35:59.578 --> 00:36:00.536
pragmatic but that is how...
Optimistic, Emily is muttering under

1135
00:36:00.536 --> 00:36:03.828
Optimistic, Emily is muttering under
her breath. That is how trade deals

1136
00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.536
her breath. That is how trade deals
are sealed in the end, people, my.

1137
00:36:06.536 --> 00:36:08.411
are sealed in the end, people, my.
Trevor? Amazingly, I

1138
00:36:08.411 --> 00:36:08.578
are sealed in the end, people, my.
Trevor? Amazingly, Iagree

1139
00:36:08.578 --> 00:36:09.328
are sealed in the end, people, my.
Trevor? Amazingly, I agree with what

1140
00:36:09.328 --> 00:36:11.328
Trevor? Amazingly, I agree with what
has been said, the big tech

1141
00:36:11.328 --> 00:36:12.036
has been said, the big tech
companies, I chair

1142
00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:12.286
has been said, the big tech
companies, I chaira

1143
00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:14.161
has been said, the big tech
companies, I chair a tech company,

1144
00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:16.578
companies, I chair a tech company,
and we don’t make that kind of

1145
00:36:16.578 --> 00:36:18.244
and we don’t make that kind of
money, but the big tech companies

1146
00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:20.661
money, but the big tech companies
are paying, I think,

1147
00:36:20.661 --> 00:36:20.828
money, but the big tech companies
are paying, Ithink, between

1148
00:36:20.828 --> 00:36:21.411
money, but the big tech companies
are paying, I think, between two —

1149
00:36:21.411 --> 00:36:21.994
are paying, I think, between two -
31: tax

1150
00:36:21.994 --> 00:36:22.203
are paying, I think, between two -
396 tax right

1151
00:36:22.203 --> 00:36:23.203
are paying, I think, between two —
3% tax right now, everyone in this

1152
00:36:23.203 --> 00:36:24.203
396 tax right now, everyone in this
room is going

1153
00:36:24.203 --> 00:36:26.411
3% tax right now, everyone in this
room is going to be paying between

1154
00:36:26.411 --> 00:36:26.619
room is going to be paying between
20-405

1155
00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:27.661
room is going to be paying between
20-40% tax. It is

1156
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:28.369
room is going to be paying between
20—A0% tax. It is just mad that we

1157
00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:28.786
20-4096 tax. It is just mad that we
allow

1158
00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:30.244
20—A0% tax. It is just mad that we
allow them to do it, and frankly,

1159
00:36:30.244 --> 00:36:31.828
allow them to do it, and frankly,
they know it is mad and they know

1160
00:36:31.828 --> 00:36:34.661
they know it is mad and they know
it’s not going to go on for ever, so

1161
00:36:34.661 --> 00:36:36.661
it’s not going to go on for ever, so
frankly, I’m completely with you.

1162
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.619
frankly, I’m completely with you.
Interesting, by the way, that I kind

1163
00:36:38.619 --> 00:36:41.203
Interesting, by the way, that I kind
of like what Sajid Javid did the

1164
00:36:41.203 --> 00:36:42.536
of like what Sajid javid did the
other day.

1165
00:36:42.536 --> 00:36:43.203
of like what Sajid Javid did the
other day. He’s obviously been

1166
00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:47.161
other day. He’s obviously been
reading Donald Trump’s book, The Art

1167
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:47.369
reading Donald Trump’s book, The Art
of

1168
00:36:47.369 --> 00:36:49.494
reading Donald Trump’s book, The Art
Of The Deal, Sarah is right, Trump

1169
00:36:49.494 --> 00:36:50.203
Of The Deal, Sarah is right, Tmmp
is a bully but

1170
00:36:50.203 --> 00:36:51.119
Of The Deal, Sarah is right, Trump
is a bully but when he is confronted

1171
00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:53.703
is a bully but when he is confronted
with someone who says, "Get out of

1172
00:36:53.703 --> 00:36:54.119
with someone who says, "Get out of
here’, like

1173
00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:56.661
with someone who says, "Get out of
here", like most bullies, he starts

1174
00:36:56.661 --> 00:36:59.453
here", like most bullies, he starts
to back down. But he put a tariff on

1175
00:36:59.453 --> 00:37:01.078
to back down. But he put a tariff on
whiskey, made good on a straight.

1176
00:37:01.078 --> 00:37:02.578
whiskey, made good on a straight.
For about ten minutes but it’s not

1177
00:37:02.578 --> 00:37:04.369
For about ten minutes but it’s not
going to be forever, the point is, I

1178
00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:06.661
going to be forever, the point is, I
think Sajid Javid is at the right

1179
00:37:06.661 --> 00:37:07.661
think Sajid javid is at the right
thing, he

1180
00:37:07.661 --> 00:37:08.786
think Sajid Javid is at the right
thing, he said, "You know what? We

1181
00:37:08.786 --> 00:37:12.119
thing, he said, "You know what? We
are going to tax these guys until we

1182
00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:14.036
are going to tax these guys until we
get an international deal", which

1183
00:37:14.036 --> 00:37:14.203
get an international deal", which
5575

1184
00:37:14.203 --> 00:37:14.994
get an international deal", which
says to Tmmp,

1185
00:37:14.994 --> 00:37:16.328
get an international deal", which
says to Trump, "Get on with it", and

1186
00:37:16.328 --> 00:37:17.286
says to Tmmp, "Get on with it’, and
I think that is

1187
00:37:17.286 --> 00:37:18.244
says to Trump, "Get on with it", and
I think that is the right way to

1188
00:37:18.244 --> 00:37:20.453
I think that is the right way to
deal with Donald Trump. This guy is

1189
00:37:20.453 --> 00:37:22.369
deal with Donald Trump. This guy is
not, you know, he is not the devil

1190
00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:24.286
not, you know, he is not the devil
incarnate. He is

1191
00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:25.203
not, you know, he is not the devil
incarnate. He isjust a bloke.

1192
00:37:25.203 --> 00:37:25.328
incarnate. He is justa bloke.
Actually,

1193
00:37:25.328 --> 00:37:26.578
incarnate. He isjust a bloke.
Actually, with most blokes, as all

1194
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.494
Actually, with most blokes, as all
of the men in here can attest, you

1195
00:37:28.494 --> 00:37:28.869
of the men in here ran attest, you
ran deal

1196
00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:31.744
of the men in here can attest, you
can deal with them by standing up to

1197
00:37:31.744 --> 00:37:32.119
ran deal with them by standing up to
them property.

1198
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:37.161
can deal with them by standing up to
them properly. APPLAUSE

1199
00:37:37.494 --> 00:37:37.744
them property. APPLAUSE
The

1200
00:37:37.744 --> 00:37:38.994

The women are clapping and their men

1201
00:37:38.994 --> 00:37:43.661
The women are clapping and their men
are not! Phil is clapping and he

1202
00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:44.786
are not! Phil is clapping and he
asked the question, are these the

1203
00:37:44.786 --> 00:37:46.453
asked the question, are these the
kind of trade—offs we will be

1204
00:37:46.453 --> 00:37:46.619
kind of trade-offs we will be
seeing,

1205
00:37:46.619 --> 00:37:47.994
kind of trade—offs we will be
seeing, given the new era we will be

1206
00:37:47.994 --> 00:37:51.869
seeing, given the new era we will be
in as of next Friday? I think it is

1207
00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:55.453
in as of next Friday? I think it is
a good question from Phil, and I

1208
00:37:55.453 --> 00:37:58.036
a good question from Phil, and I
will think about your question now.

1209
00:37:58.036 --> 00:38:01.161
will think about your question now.
In answer to the first part of the

1210
00:38:01.161 --> 00:38:03.411
In answer to the first part of the
question, is this a risk worth

1211
00:38:03.411 --> 00:38:04.578
question, is this a risk worth
taking? Well, I

1212
00:38:04.578 --> 00:38:04.786
question, is this a risk worth
taking? Well, Ithink

1213
00:38:04.786 --> 00:38:05.244
question, is this a risk worth
taking? Well, I think it is,

1214
00:38:05.244 --> 00:38:05.411
taking? Well, Ithink it is,
precisely

1215
00:38:05.411 --> 00:38:06.411
taking? Well, I think it is,
precisely because of what Trevor and

1216
00:38:06.411 --> 00:38:08.828
precisely because of what Trevor and
the others have said which was that

1217
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.994
the others have said which was that
we have actually got to do something

1218
00:38:10.994 --> 00:38:12.453
we have actually got to do something
with the tech firms. I have been

1219
00:38:12.453 --> 00:38:15.036
with the tech firms. I have been
hanging on about the tech firms as a

1220
00:38:15.036 --> 00:38:15.203
banging on about the tech firms as a
police

1221
00:38:15.203 --> 00:38:15.661
hanging on about the tech firms as a
police chief for

1222
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:16.744
banging on about the tech firms as a
police chief for the last ten years,

1223
00:38:16.744 --> 00:38:18.078
police chief for the last ten years,
that they were not paying their

1224
00:38:18.078 --> 00:38:21.411
that they were not paying their
dues. One of the reasons why you

1225
00:38:21.411 --> 00:38:23.161
dues. One of the reasons why you
don’t see police officers on the

1226
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:25.494
don’t see police officers on the
street is 50% of all crime now that

1227
00:38:25.494 --> 00:38:25.869
street is 5096 of all crime now that
occurs in

1228

occurs in the UK is actually online.

And the people who have caused that,

00:38:31.578 --> 00:38:31.744
And the peopla who have caused that,
who

And the people who have caused that,
who facilitate it, who allow it,

00:38:33.494 --> 00:38:39.244
who facilitate it, who allow it,
they pay no tax. So a levy of 2%, in

1233
00:38:39.244 --> 00:38:40.286
they pay no tax. So a levy of 296, in
my book, is not

1234
00:38:40.286 --> 00:38:41.411
they pay no tax. 50 a levy of 2%, in
my book, is not enough. It was

1235
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:43.619
my book, is not enough. It was
really interesting, the head of

Google Alphabet this week speculated

1237
00:38:45.994 --> 00:38:46.994
Google Alphabet this week speculated
that Al, artificial intelligence, is

1238
00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:50.328
that Al, artificial intelligence, is
going to be more important for

1239
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:53.828
going to be more important for
humans than fire. Well, I have got a

1240
00:38:53.828 --> 00:38:56.953
humans than fire. Well, I have got a
bit of advice for him, I think that

1241
00:38:56.953 --> 00:38:59.661
bit of advice for him, I think that
fire is more important than

1242
00:38:59.661 --> 00:39:00.703
fire is more important than
artificial intelligence and paying

1243
00:39:00.703 --> 00:39:02.119
artificial intelligence and paying
tax is definitely more important

1244
00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:04.411
tax is definitely more important
than artificial intelligence and

1245
00:39:04.411 --> 00:39:06.661
than artificial intelligence and
they are just not doing it. They are

1246
00:39:06.661 --> 00:39:10.119

OK, let’s take another question.

1276
00:39:57.036 --> 00:39:59.411
Do Londoners live in a political
bubble and should Labour

1277
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:02.536
stop listening to them
if they want to win an election?

1278
00:40:02.536 --> 00:40:10.828
APPLAUSE
Emily? Should you stop listening? I

1279
00:40:10.828 --> 00:40:11.453
Emily? Should you stop listening? I
think... I

1280
00:40:11.453 --> 00:40:12.619
Emily? Should you stop listening? I
think... Ithink

1281
00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:13.203
Emily? Should you stop listening? I
think... I think what is important

1282
00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:14.494
think... I think what is important
is that politicians always listen

1283
00:40:14.494 --> 00:40:17.244
is that politicians always listen
and that they listen to people from

1284
00:40:17.244 --> 00:40:18.036
and that they listen to peopla from
all over.

1285
00:40:18.036 --> 00:40:19.203
and that they listen to people from
all over. Do you think Labour has

1286
00:40:19.203 --> 00:40:19.786
all over. Do you think labour has
been listening

1287
00:40:19.786 --> 00:40:21.411
all over. Do you think Labour has
been listening to the wrong people?

1288
00:40:21.411 --> 00:40:22.911
been listening to the wrong people?
Know, I think Labour has been

1289
00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:23.786
Know, I think labour has been
listening to

1290
00:40:23.786 --> 00:40:25.411
Know, I think Labour has been
listening to people in all of our

1291
00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:27.328
listening to people in all of our
communities. I think we could not

1292
00:40:27.328 --> 00:40:28.994
communities. I think we could not
agree on what the right approach on

1293
00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:30.619
agree on what the right approach on
Brexit was and frankly, I think that

1294
00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:33.286
Brexit was and frankly, I think that
what happened with the last general

1295
00:40:33.286 --> 00:40:34.453
what happened with the last general
election was a monumental mistake. I

1296
00:40:34.453 --> 00:40:34.828
elaction was a monumental mistake. I
don’t think

1297
00:40:34.828 --> 00:40:36.203
election was a monumental mistake. I
don’t think we should have had a

1298
00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:37.661
don’t think we should have had a
general election, I think we should

1299
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:39.036
general election, I think we should
have had another referendum, if we

1300
00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:40.703
have had another referendum, if we
wanted to get Brexit done, we should

1301
00:40:40.703 --> 00:40:43.078
wanted to get Brexit done, we should
have put the single issue to the

1302
00:40:43.078 --> 00:40:43.369
have put the single issue to the
pub“:

1303
00:40:43.369 --> 00:40:45.078
have put the single issue to the
public and said, "Do you want Boris

1304
00:40:45.078 --> 00:40:46.244
public and said, "Do you want Boris
johnson’s deal

1305
00:40:46.244 --> 00:40:47.203
public and said, "Do you want Boris
Johnson’s deal or don’t you? Let’s

1306
00:40:47.203 --> 00:40:47.578
johnson’s deal or don’t you? Let’s
deal with

1307
00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:50.203
Johnson’s deal or don’t you? Let’s
deal with that one issue and then

1308
00:40:50.203 --> 00:40:52.078
deal with that one issue and then
move on". You have said that the

1309
00:40:52.078 --> 00:40:53.786
move on". You have said that the
number of times, I’m not suggesting

1310
00:40:53.786 --> 00:40:54.953
number of times, I’m not suggesting
you shouldn’t but I remember you

1311
00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:56.578
you shouldn’t but I remember you
saying that on this programme, in

1312
00:40:56.578 --> 00:40:59.203
saying that on this programme, in
fact. What would... You are

1313
00:40:59.203 --> 00:41:00.244
fact. what would... You are
campaigning

1314
00:41:00.244 --> 00:41:00.994
fact. What would... You are
campaigning for the Labour

1315
00:41:00.994 --> 00:41:01.786
campaigning for the Labour
leadership, obviously, what would

1316
00:41:01.786 --> 00:41:03.869
leadership, obviously, what would
the party look like and you? The

1317
00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:05.494
the party look like and you? The
same Corbyn policies or a different

1318
00:41:05.494 --> 00:41:06.703
same Corbyn policies or a different
figurehead or would you move the

1319
00:41:06.703 --> 00:41:07.661
figurehead or would you move the
labour Party

1320
00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:08.244
figurehead or would you move the
Labour Party in a different

1321
00:41:08.244 --> 00:41:08.453
labour Party in a different
direction,

1322
00:41:08.453 --> 00:41:10.244
Labour Party in a different
direction, more towards the centre,

1323
00:41:10.244 --> 00:41:12.036
direction, more towards the centre,
for example? I don’t think Labour

1324
00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:12.661
for exampla? I don’t think labour
needs to

1325
00:41:12.661 --> 00:41:13.494
for example? I don’t think Labour
needs to have some kind of

1326
00:41:13.494 --> 00:41:15.078
needs to have some kind of
existential crisis about who we are,

1327
00:41:15.078 --> 00:41:16.786
existential crisis about who we are,
we know who we are and we are proud

1328
00:41:16.786 --> 00:41:18.661
we know who we are and we are proud
of who we are but I don’t think at

1329
00:41:18.661 --> 00:41:20.203
of who we are but I don’t think at
the last general election, first of

1330
00:41:20.203 --> 00:41:22.078
the last general election, first of
all, as I said, we try to change the

1331
00:41:22.078 --> 00:41:23.619
all, as I said, we try to change the
subject and we were not able to

1332
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:26.703
subject and we were not able to
because Boris on the one side says,

1333
00:41:26.703 --> 00:41:28.119
because Boris on the one side says,
"Get Brexit done", and we have got

1334
00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.286
"Get Brexit done", and we have got
three and half paragraphs of arts

1335
00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.953
three and half paragraphs of arts
and we try to change the subject. 50

1336
00:41:31.953 --> 00:41:32.953
and we try to change the subject. So
7°“-

1337
00:41:32.953 --> 00:41:33.911
and we try to change the subject. So
you, going for

1338
00:41:33.911 --> 00:41:35.244
and we try to change the subject. 50
you, going for the leadership, you

1339
00:41:35.244 --> 00:41:37.119
you, going for the leadership, you
say we know who we are but who would

1340
00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:38.244
say we know who we are but who would
labour the under you with yellow

1341
00:41:38.244 --> 00:41:40.119
labour the under you with yellow
what we would do is I think we would

1342
00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:41.286
what we would do is I think we would
do something which is actually... Is

1343
00:41:41.286 --> 00:41:44.244
do something which is actually... Is
what Britain wants and what Britain

1344
00:41:44.244 --> 00:41:45.869
what Britain wants and what Britain
sees itself as being of a

1345
00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:46.953
sees itself as being of a
compassionate society where we look

1346
00:41:46.953 --> 00:41:49.661
compassionate society where we look
after one another. Something

1347
00:41:49.661 --> 00:41:50.786
after one another. Something
catastrophic could happen to anyone

1348
00:41:50.786 --> 00:41:52.994
catastrophic could happen to anyone
in this room and we will look after

1349
00:41:52.994 --> 00:41:54.578
in this room and we will look after
one another, whether you are ill and

1350
00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.536
one another, whether you are ill and
the NHS for look you, whether you

1351
00:41:56.536 --> 00:41:56.953
the NHS for look you, whether you
lose your

1352
00:41:56.953 --> 00:41:58.328
the NHS for look you, whether you
lose yourjob and there will be a

1353
00:41:58.328 --> 00:42:00.911
lose yourjob and there will be a
safety net for you. At the moment,

1354
00:42:00.911 --> 00:42:02.536
safety net for you. At the moment,
the safety net has such huge holes

1355
00:42:02.536 --> 00:42:05.494
the safety net has such huge holes
in it that entire families. And end

1356
00:42:05.494 --> 00:42:05.703
in it that entire families. And end
“P

1357
00:42:05.703 --> 00:42:07.203
in it that entire families. And end
up in food banks. We are disgusted

1358
00:42:07.203 --> 00:42:08.661
up in food banks. We are disgusted
as a nation, the number of people

1359
00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:09.661
as a nation, the number of peopla
who are

1360
00:42:09.661 --> 00:42:11.286
as a nation, the number of people
who are sleeping on the street.

1361
00:42:11.286 --> 00:42:12.661
who are sleeping on the street.
There is another way, it doesn’t

1362
00:42:12.661 --> 00:42:14.244
There is another way, it doesn’t
have to be like this and we also

1363
00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:16.661
have to be like this and we also
need to be a nation where we give

1364
00:42:16.661 --> 00:42:17.619
need to be a nation where we give
one another opportunities, where we

1365
00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:19.703
one another opportunities, where we
help one another to do well and

1366
00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:20.828
help one another to do well and
effectively, I think that is what

1367
00:42:20.828 --> 00:42:25.078
effectively, I think that is what
Britain wants. They want to have an

1368
00:42:25.078 --> 00:42:26.619
Britain wants. They want to have an
opposition and unfortunately, an

1369
00:42:26.619 --> 00:42:27.661
opposition and unfortunately, an
opposition now, that they can

1370
00:42:27.661 --> 00:42:29.578
opposition now, that they can
believe in so when we say, "It

00:42:29.578 --> 00:42:32.203

believable, and they know that these

1376
00:42:35.453 --> 00:42:36.744
believable, and they know that these
appalling Tories are not the only

appalling Tories are not the only
“Y

1378
00:42:36.911 --> 00:42:39.911

more police on the street. For us,
that’s a problem because we go and

that’s a problem because we go and
report abuse and we would be asked

questions like they don’t see a red

The man in the glasses at the back,
yes. I think that one of the things

yes. I think that one of the things
Jeremy Corbyn has done which I think

1425
00:43:55.411 --> 00:43:57.161
jeremy Corbyn has done which I think
was very bad is

1426
00:43:57.161 --> 00:43:57.953
Jeremy Corbyn has done which I think
was very bad is he has never agreed

1427
00:43:57.953 --> 00:43:58.703
was very bad is he has never agreed
with what Boris

1428
00:43:58.703 --> 00:43:59.619
was very bad is he has never agreed
with what BorisJohnson or Theresa

with what Boris johnson or Theresa
May has ever

1430
00:44:00.286 --> 00:44:01.411
with what BorisJohnson or Theresa
May has ever said and I think that

00:44:01.411 --> 00:44:04.786
May has ever said and I think that
if you were made a leader, you

1432

if you were made a leader, you
should at least sometimes say,

on northerners, for example,
manipulating them, let’s use the

vast majority of papers and Rupert

1483
00:45:18.744 --> 00:45:20.536
vast majority of papers and Rupert
Murdoch particularly. We have got

1484
00:45:20.536 --> 00:45:22.203
Murdoch particularly. We have got
someone he who works for a Murdoch

1485
00:45:22.203 --> 00:45:23.661
someone he who works for a Murdoch
paper so you are perfectly placed to

paper so you are perfectly placed to
answer that question. I have never

in an existential crisis. It could
sink further in votes, there is

1508
00:46:07.119 --> 00:46:09.203
sink further in votes, there is
about another 30 seats in the red

00:46:38.203 --> 00:46:40.953
[ended his party in. APPLAUSE
Mike, I know you want to come in so

1531
00:46:40.953 --> 00:46:42.286
Mike, I know you want to come in so
the question was, do Londoners live

1532
00:46:42.286 --> 00:46:44.494
the question was, do Londoners live
in a political bubble and should

1533
00:46:44.494 --> 00:46:44.786
in a political bubbla and should
labour

1534
00:46:44.786 --> 00:46:46.619
in a political bubble and should
Labour listen to them if they want

1535
00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:47.203
labour listen to them if they want
to win an

1536
00:46:47.203 --> 00:46:48.578
Labour listen to them if they want
to win an election? What is your

1537
00:46:48.578 --> 00:46:48.786
to win an election? what is your
perspective,

1538
00:46:48.786 --> 00:46:49.619
to win an election? What is your
perspective, given your time in

1539
00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:52.119
perspective, given your time in
Durham? Clearly, there are really

1540
00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:52.453
Durham? Clearty, there are really
deprived

1541
00:46:52.453 --> 00:46:53.744
Durham? Clearly, there are really
deprived communities in London so

1542
00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:55.161
deprived communities in London so
for people to characterise London as

1543
00:46:55.161 --> 00:46:55.661
for peopla to characterise London as
a homogenous

1544
00:46:55.661 --> 00:46:58.578
for people to characterise London as
a homogenous group of people is

1545
00:46:58.578 --> 00:46:58.994
a homogenous group of peopla is
insulting and

1546
00:46:58.994 --> 00:46:59.786
a homogenous group of people is
insulting and inaccurate so the lady

1547
00:46:59.786 --> 00:47:02.411
insulting and inaccurate so the lady
in tangerine at the front, we

1548
00:47:02.411 --> 00:47:03.828
in tangerine at the front, we
absolutely hear you and when I heard

1549
00:47:03.828 --> 00:47:05.453
absolutely hear you and when I heard
you say what you said, it

1550
00:47:05.453 --> 00:47:05.661
absolutely hear you and when I heard
you say what you said, itjust

1551
00:47:05.661 --> 00:47:06.369
absolutely hear you and when I heard
you say what you said, it just felt

1552
00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:08.661
you say what you said, it just felt
like the police force I

1553
00:47:08.661 --> 00:47:08.994
you say what you said, it just felt
like the police force Ijoined 39

1554
00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:10.786
like the police force Ijoined 39
years ago, not the one that I am

1555
00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:11.328
years ago, not the one that I am
proud to have

1556
00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:11.619
years ago, not the one that I am
proud to havejust

1557
00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:11.703
years ago, not the one that I am
proud to have just left,

1558
00:47:11.703 --> 00:47:13.661
years ago, not the one that I am
proud to havejust left, so again, I

1559
00:47:13.661 --> 00:47:14.161
proud to have just left, so again, I
offer a

1560
00:47:14.161 --> 00:47:15.244
proud to havejust left, so again, I
offer a conversation with you later,

1561
00:47:15.244 --> 00:47:17.494
offer a conversation with you later,
to see if we can resolve some issues

1562
00:47:17.494 --> 00:47:17.661
to see if we ran resolve some issues
there

1563
00:47:17.661 --> 00:47:20.078
to see if we can resolve some issues
there because it sounds terrible.

1564
00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:28.411
There is a sense elsewhere in the
country that legislation and policy

1565
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:28.578
country that lagislation and policy
is

1566
00:47:28.578 --> 00:47:30.994
country that legislation and policy
is London—centric. I am going to

1567
00:47:30.994 --> 00:47:31.619
is London-centric. I am going to
give you two

1568
00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:36.203
is London—centric. I am going to
give you two examples. The bedroom

1569
00:47:36.203 --> 00:47:37.661
give you two examples. The bedroom
tax, when it hit County Durham,

1570
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:39.786
tax, when it hit County Durham,
meant that people moved out of

1571
00:47:39.786 --> 00:47:40.161
meant that peopla moved out of
perfectly

1572
00:47:40.161 --> 00:47:40.911
meant that people moved out of
perfectly serviceable houses and we

1573
00:47:40.911 --> 00:47:41.161
perfectly serviceabla houses and we
now

1574
00:47:41.161 --> 00:47:45.744
perfectly serviceable houses and we
now have empty streets because mums

1575
00:47:45.744 --> 00:47:49.119
now have empty streets because mums
and single parents were living in

1576
00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:49.369
and singla parents were living in
solidly

1577
00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:51.619
and single parents were living in
solidly built, three—bedroom houses

1578
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:51.953
solidly built, three-bedroom houses
that they

1579
00:47:51.953 --> 00:47:55.078
solidly built, three—bedroom houses
that they were going to be fined for

1580
00:47:55.078 --> 00:47:57.619
that they were going to be fined for
living in. And that is because that

1581
00:47:57.619 --> 00:47:58.619
living in. And that is because that
sort of issue was very

1582
00:47:58.619 --> 00:48:03.786
sort of issue was very
London—centric. That can also be a

1583
00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:03.994
London-centric. That ran also be a
social

1584
00:48:03.994 --> 00:48:05.453
London—centric. That can also be a
social mistake. I am going back a

1585
00:48:05.453 --> 00:48:08.578
social mistake. I am going back a
long way now to when Princess Diana

1586
00:48:08.578 --> 00:48:12.036
long way now to when Princess Diana
died. It was very insulting to the

1587
00:48:12.036 --> 00:48:13.536
died. It was very insulting to the
rest of the country when all the

1588
00:48:13.536 --> 00:48:14.703
rest of the country when all the
commentators and all the noise was

1589
00:48:14.703 --> 00:48:17.119
commentators and all the noise was
that the Queen had to come home to

1590
00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:20.411
that the Queen had to come home to
her people. She was in Balmoral. She

1591
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:24.036
her people. She was in Balmoral. She
is the Queen of Scotland. And this

1592
00:48:24.036 --> 00:48:26.078
is the Queen of Scotland. And this
idea that somehow, the economy has

1593
00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:27.494
idea that somehow, the economy has
to be based around London and there

1594
00:48:27.494 --> 00:48:30.994
to be based around London and there
is a trickle—down effect is just not

1595
00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:31.328
is a trickla-down effect is just not
working. And

1596
00:48:31.328 --> 00:48:33.411
is a trickle—down effect is just not
working. And we have seen that. That

1597
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:36.411
working. And we have seen that. That
is why there is the vote that we

1598
00:48:36.411 --> 00:48:37.994
is why there is the vote that we
have just seen. People feel

1599
00:48:37.994 --> 00:48:39.578
have just seen. People feel
disenfranchised. But I want to make

1600
00:48:39.578 --> 00:48:42.286
disenfranchised. But I want to make
it clear that there will be plenty

1601
00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:42.661
it clear that there will be planty
of peopla

1602
00:48:42.661 --> 00:48:43.203
it clear that there will be plenty
of people feeling equally

1603
00:48:43.203 --> 00:48:49.619
of people feeling equally
disenfranchised in London. Theresa?

1604
00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.619
disenfranchised in London. Theresa?
I don’t agree that Londoners live in

1605
00:48:52.619 --> 00:48:56.619
I don’t agree that Londoners live in
a political bubble, but I do think

1606
00:48:56.619 --> 00:48:56.744
a political bubbla, but I do think
that

1607
00:48:56.744 --> 00:48:57.828
a political bubble, but I do think
that Labour needs to change

1608
00:48:57.828 --> 00:48:59.036
that Labour needs to change
fundamentally before it will be fit

1609
00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:02.161
fundamentally before it will be fit
for government again. It needs to

1610
00:49:02.161 --> 00:49:03.661
for government again. It needs to
change because it needs an economic

1611
00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:08.203
change because it needs an economic
policy that adds up. It needs to

1612
00:49:08.203 --> 00:49:10.078
policy that adds up. It needs to
change so that its Brexit policy

1613
00:49:10.078 --> 00:49:12.661
change so that its Brexit policy
respect the democratic vote of the

1614
00:49:12.661 --> 00:49:16.453
respect the democratic vote of the
country. And most crucially, it

1615
00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:19.244
country. And most crucially, it
needs to deal with this disgraceful

1616
00:49:19.244 --> 00:49:20.078
needs to deal with this disgraceful
problem with anti—Semitism and

1617
00:49:20.078 --> 00:49:24.244
problem with anti-Semitism and
racism.

1618
00:49:24.244 --> 00:49:25.994
problem with anti—Semitism and
racism. Let me go around a couple of

1619
00:49:25.994 --> 00:49:26.203
racism. Let me go around a couple of
peopla

1620
00:49:26.203 --> 00:49:30.244
racism. Let me go around a couple of
people before I come to Trevor. The

1621
00:49:30.244 --> 00:49:33.953
people before I come to Trevor. The
woman there? Theresa Villiers is

1622
00:49:33.953 --> 00:49:35.911
woman there? Theresa Villiers is
talking about respecting the will of

1623
00:49:35.911 --> 00:49:37.161
talking about respecting the will of
the people when just today, the

1624
00:49:37.161 --> 00:49:38.661
the peopla when just today, the
Welsh

1625
00:49:38.661 --> 00:49:41.286
the people when just today, the
Welsh assembly, and we have had the

1626
00:49:41.286 --> 00:49:42.703
Welsh assembly, and we have had the
Scottish parliament and Stormont all

1627
00:49:42.703 --> 00:49:42.994
Scottish partiament and Stormont all
voting

1628
00:49:42.994 --> 00:49:45.203
Scottish parliament and Stormont all
voting against the Brexit Bill. And

1629
00:49:45.203 --> 00:49:47.578
voting against the Brexit Bill. And
they are not being listened to. As a

1630
00:49:47.578 --> 00:49:48.161
they are not being listened to. As a
Londoner, I am

1631
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:52.786
they are not being listened to. As a
Londoner, lam really

1632
00:49:52.786 --> 00:49:53.536
they are not being listened to. As a
Londoner, I am really sorry to the

1633
00:49:53.536 --> 00:49:55.703
Londoner, I am really sorry to the
other nations of the UK. It is not

1634
00:49:55.703 --> 00:49:57.286
other nations of the UK. It is not
London that is doing that to you. We

1635
00:49:57.286 --> 00:49:58.911
London that is doing that to you. We
all have to respect the fact that we

1636
00:49:58.911 --> 00:50:00.286
all have to respect the fact that we
have different views and try and

1637
00:50:00.286 --> 00:50:04.453
have different views and try and
think about in some way recognising

1638
00:50:04.453 --> 00:50:07.453
think about in some way recognising
that we exist as well here in

1639
00:50:07.453 --> 00:50:09.244
that we exist as well here in
London, and that it is not a bad

1640
00:50:09.244 --> 00:50:10.661
London, and that it is not a bad
thing to listen to us just because

1641
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:13.828
thing to listen to us just because
we are in London. The man in the red

1642
00:50:13.828 --> 00:50:16.619
we are in London. The man in the red
jacket? I

1643
00:50:16.619 --> 00:50:18.619
we are in London. The man in the red
jacket? Ijust wanted to say

1644
00:50:18.619 --> 00:50:18.786
we are in London. The man in the red
jacket? I just wanted to say that

1645
00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:19.994
jacket? I just wanted to say that
the Labour Party keep saying that

1646
00:50:19.994 --> 00:50:20.286
the labour Party keep saying that
Brexit

1647
00:50:20.286 --> 00:50:21.411
the Labour Party keep saying that
Brexit is not getting done at the

1648
00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:22.994
Brexit is not getting done at the
end of the month and that it will

1649
00:50:22.994 --> 00:50:24.411
end of the month and that it will
take a long time to negotiate any

1650
00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:27.036
take a long time to negotiate any
deal, yet no one in the leadership

1651
00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:28.036
deal, yet no one in the leadership
contest is championing anything

1652
00:50:28.036 --> 00:50:30.953
contest is championing anything
resembling Brexit as people voted.

1653
00:50:30.953 --> 00:50:34.578
resembling Brexit as people voted.
Emily Thornberry, you say there is

1654
00:50:34.578 --> 00:50:36.619
Emily Thornberry, you say there is
no chance that a deal will be agreed

1655
00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:39.494
no chance that a deal will be agreed
before the end of the year, yet the

1656
00:50:39.494 --> 00:50:40.953
before the end of the year, yet the
chair of the trade committee of the

1657
00:50:40.953 --> 00:50:42.786
chair of the trade committee of the
EU has said it is possible, so why

1658
00:50:42.786 --> 00:50:45.494
EU has said it is possible, so why
are you so negative about it? Let me

1659
00:50:45.494 --> 00:50:50.244
are you so negative about it? Let me
get Trevor in. In the companies that

1660
00:50:50.244 --> 00:50:52.119
get Trevor in. In the companies that
I work for, we have a lot of people

1661
00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:52.453
I work for, we have a lot of peopla
who work

1662
00:50:52.453 --> 00:50:57.119
I work for, we have a lot of people
who work outside London. Firstly, I

1663
00:50:57.119 --> 00:50:58.453
who work outside London. Firstly, I
apologise to the person who said

1664
00:50:58.453 --> 00:51:00.078
apologise to the person who said
northerners are brainwashed, he

1665
00:51:00.078 --> 00:51:03.161
northerners are brainwashed, he
didn’t really mean it. He was saying

1666
00:51:03.161 --> 00:51:04.578
didn’t really mean it. He was saying
something quite different. Everybody

1667
00:51:04.578 --> 00:51:06.161
something quite different. Everybody
outside London is a smart as

1668
00:51:06.161 --> 00:51:07.453
outside London is a smart as
everybody inside London and I had

1669
00:51:07.453 --> 00:51:09.328
everybody inside London and I had
nothing to do with that remark.

1670
00:51:09.328 --> 00:51:12.869
nothing to do with that remark.
There is a separate point here. Not

1671
00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:15.078
There is a separate point here. Not
everybody in London is the same.

1672
00:51:15.078 --> 00:51:15.411
everybody in London is the same.
when it

1673
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:18.161
everybody in London is the same.
When it comes to listening, one of

1674
00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:18.661
when it comes to listening, one of
the things

1675
00:51:18.661 --> 00:51:19.411
When it comes to listening, one of
the things which struck me during

1676
00:51:19.411 --> 00:51:24.369
the things which stmck me during
the

1677
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:26.661
the election tells me that the

1678
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:27.036
the elaction tells me that the
labour

1679
00:51:27.036 --> 00:51:28.286
the election tells me that the
Labour Party, which, by the way, I

1680
00:51:28.286 --> 00:51:29.828
labour Party, which, by the way, I
am still a

1681
00:51:29.828 --> 00:51:30.119
Labour Party, which, by the way, I
am still a member,

1682
00:51:30.119 --> 00:51:30.328
Labour Party, which, by the way, I
am stilla member, has

1683
00:51:30.328 --> 00:51:30.661
Labour Party, which, by the way, I
am still a member, has a problem

1684
00:51:30.661 --> 00:51:33.911
am still a member, has a problem
with listening, was our great big

1685
00:51:33.911 --> 00:51:34.036
with listening, was our great big
ﬂagship

1686
00:51:34.036 --> 00:51:37.578
with listening, was our great big
flagship policy about broadband. I

1687
00:51:37.578 --> 00:51:38.036
ﬂagship policy about broadband. I
talked

1688
00:51:38.036 --> 00:51:40.203
flagship policy about broadband. I
talked to people both in London and

1689
00:51:40.203 --> 00:51:40.536
talked to peopla both in London and
outside

1690
00:51:40.536 --> 00:51:41.286
talked to people both in London and
outside London, and they literally

1691
00:51:41.286 --> 00:51:44.869
outside London, and they literally
all said the same thing. Did they

1692
00:51:44.869 --> 00:51:48.578
all said the same thing. Did they
say what the woman in the red dress

1693
00:51:48.578 --> 00:51:51.286
say what the woman in the red dress
set, rubbish? You’re going to give

1694
00:51:51.286 --> 00:51:53.244
set, rubbish? You’re going to give
me free broadband? I can’t even pay

1695
00:51:53.244 --> 00:51:54.411
me free broadband? I can’t even pay
my water and electricity bill, help

1696
00:51:54.411 --> 00:52:01.161
my water and electricity bill, help
me with that first! You’re going to

1697
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:02.203
me with that first! You’re going to
give me free broadband so

1698
00:52:02.203 --> 00:52:02.369
me with that first! You’re going to
give me free broadband sol

1699
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:02.578
me with that first! You’re going to
give me free broadband so I can

1700
00:52:02.578 --> 00:52:02.994
give me free broadband so I ran
tweak to

1701
00:52:02.994 --> 00:52:04.244
give me free broadband so I can
tweak to people that I am dying of

1702
00:52:04.244 --> 00:52:05.036
tweak to peopla that I am dying of
dehydration!

1703
00:52:05.036 --> 00:52:07.786
tweak to people that I am dying of
dehydration! —— I can tweet to

1704
00:52:07.786 --> 00:52:08.786
dehydration! -- I ran tweet to
people. That is

1705
00:52:08.786 --> 00:52:10.161
dehydration! —— I can tweet to
people. That is an example of Labour

1706
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:10.411
peopla. That is an example of labour
not

1707
00:52:10.411 --> 00:52:10.744
people. That is an example of labour
not listening to

1708
00:52:10.744 --> 00:52:13.161
people. That is an example of Labour
not listening to its own people, but

1709
00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:14.494
not listening to its own people, but
because we came up with a policy

1710
00:52:14.494 --> 00:52:15.869
because we came up with a policy
that even our own people couldn’t

1711
00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:16.661
that even our own peopla couldn’t
identify with.

1712
00:52:16.661 --> 00:52:21.036
that even our own people couldn’t
identify with. If I could make a

1713
00:52:21.036 --> 00:52:22.536
identify with. If I could make a
quick point, we will see who comes

1714
00:52:22.536 --> 00:52:25.244
quick point, we will see who comes
out as leader but I don’t think our

1715
00:52:25.244 --> 00:52:27.661
out as leader but I don’t think our
biggest problem is the leadership is

1716
00:52:27.661 --> 00:52:29.786
biggest problem is the leadership is
a party. Our problem is the

1717
00:52:29.786 --> 00:52:31.244
a party. Our problem is the
followership. This week, somebody

1718
00:52:31.244 --> 00:52:33.203
followership. This week, somebody
pulled the Labour Party members and

1719
00:52:33.203 --> 00:52:34.244
pulled the labour Party members and
asked them,

1720
00:52:34.244 --> 00:52:36.036
pulled the Labour Party members and
asked them, who is the greatest

1721
00:52:36.036 --> 00:52:36.286
asked them, who is the greatest
labour

1722
00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.786
asked them, who is the greatest
Labour leader of the last 100 years?

1723
00:52:38.786 --> 00:52:39.161
labour leader of the last 100 years?
They walked

1724
00:52:39.161 --> 00:52:42.619
Labour leader of the last 100 years?
They walked straight past Blair,

1725
00:52:42.619 --> 00:52:43.411
They walked straight past Blair,
three election victories. They

1726
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:45.703
three election victories. They
weren’t interested in Wilson, who

1727
00:52:45.703 --> 00:52:50.994
weren’t interested in Wilson, who
gave us our anti—discrimination and

1728
00:52:50.994 --> 00:52:51.661
gave us our anti-discrimination and
Equal Pay Act.

1729
00:52:51.661 --> 00:52:52.286
gave us our anti—discrimination and
Equal Pay Act. They didn’t even

1730
00:52:52.286 --> 00:52:54.453
Equal Pay Act. They didn’t even
think about Attlee, who created the

1731
00:52:54.453 --> 00:52:56.286
think about Attlee, who created the
NHS. 70% said Jeremy Corbyn, who

1732
00:52:56.286 --> 00:52:56.869
NHS. 7096 said jeremy Corbyn, who
gave us two

1733
00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:57.661
NHS. 70% said Jeremy Corbyn, who
gave us two lost elections and gave

1734
00:52:57.661 --> 00:53:00.869
gave us two lost elections and gave
the Tories 60 seats that they have

1735
00:53:00.869 --> 00:53:04.244
the Tories 60 seats that they have
never won before. We hear you.

1736
00:53:04.244 --> 00:53:08.369
never won before. We hear you.
Emily, be quick. There is a lot to

1737
00:53:08.369 --> 00:53:12.453
Emily, be quick. There is a lot to
say! I

1738
00:53:12.453 --> 00:53:12.661
Emily, be quick. There is a lot to
say! Iwill

1739
00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:13.536
Emily, be quick. There is a lot to
say! I will leave the issue about

1740
00:53:13.536 --> 00:53:15.244
say! I will leave the issue about
Brexit and I will come onto the

1741
00:53:15.244 --> 00:53:16.953
Brexit and I will come onto the
fasting off of

1742
00:53:16.953 --> 00:53:17.578
Brexit and I will come onto the
casting off of the shadow of

1743
00:53:17.578 --> 00:53:18.286
casting off of the shadow of
Corbynism. Frankly, I

1744
00:53:18.286 --> 00:53:18.536
casting off of the shadow of
Corbynism. Frankly, Ithink

1745
00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:19.161
casting off of the shadow of
Corbynism. Frankly, I think this is

1746
00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:19.786
Corbynism. Frankly, Ithink this is
part of

1747
00:53:19.786 --> 00:53:21.703
Corbynism. Frankly, I think this is
part of the issue. I think that if

1748
00:53:21.703 --> 00:53:22.161
part of the issue. I think that if
fasting

1749
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:23.661
part of the issue. I think that if
casting a shadow of Corbynism means

1750
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:24.453
casting a shadow of Corbynism means
fasting off

1751
00:53:24.453 --> 00:53:25.453
casting a shadow of Corbynism means
casting off speaking from the heart,

1752
00:53:25.453 --> 00:53:25.786
fasting off speaking from the heart,
I don’t

1753
00:53:25.786 --> 00:53:27.828
casting off speaking from the heart,
I don’t cut that off. I don’t cast

1754
00:53:27.828 --> 00:53:28.994
I don’t cut that off. I don’t cast
off the reinvigorating of the Labour

1755
00:53:28.994 --> 00:53:29.703
off the reinvigorating of the labour
Party and

1756
00:53:29.703 --> 00:53:31.203
off the reinvigorating of the Labour
Party and bringing people in. If we

1757
00:53:31.203 --> 00:53:31.661
Party and bringing peopla in. Ifwe
are genuine

1758
00:53:31.661 --> 00:53:33.828
Party and bringing people in. If we
are genuine and we are true and we

1759
00:53:33.828 --> 00:53:34.494
are genuine and we are tme and we
say what we

1760
00:53:34.494 --> 00:53:36.578
are genuine and we are true and we
say what we believe and we mean what

1761
00:53:36.578 --> 00:53:38.036
say what we believe and we mean what
we say, then I think people will

1762
00:53:38.036 --> 00:53:38.536
we say, then I think peopla will
start to

1763
00:53:38.536 --> 00:53:39.953
we say, then I think people will
start to come to us. But I do think

1764
00:53:39.953 --> 00:53:42.078
start to come to us. But I do think
that if we cannot deal with the

1765
00:53:42.078 --> 00:53:44.661
that if we cannot deal with the
issue of anti—Semitism in our own

1766
00:53:44.661 --> 00:53:44.869
issue of anti-Semitism in our own
Party.

1767
00:53:44.869 --> 00:53:45.286
issue of anti-Semitism in our own
party, then I

1768
00:53:45.286 --> 00:53:45.911
issue of anti—Semitism in our own
party, then I understand why people

1769
00:53:45.911 --> 00:53:46.786
party, then I understand why peopla
across

1770
00:53:46.786 --> 00:53:47.828
party, then I understand why people
across the country didn’t believe we

1771
00:53:47.828 --> 00:53:50.578
across the country didn’t believe we
could transform our economy. If we

1772
00:53:50.578 --> 00:53:52.661
could transform our economy. If we
can’t even deal with an issue like

1773
00:53:52.661 --> 00:53:54.411
can’t even deal with an issue like
that, then one can understand why

1774
00:53:54.411 --> 00:53:54.869
that, then one ran understand why
peopla found

1775
00:53:54.869 --> 00:53:55.661
that, then one can understand why
people found it difficult to follow

1776
00:53:55.661 --> 00:53:55.994
peopla found it difficult to follow
us and

1777
00:53:55.994 --> 00:53:58.369
people found it difficult to follow
us and believe in us. We have to

1778
00:53:58.369 --> 00:53:59.536
us and believe in us. We have to
speak on behalf of the whole

1779
00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:01.994
speak on behalf of the whola
country. 1.I

1780
00:54:01.994 --> 00:54:03.119
speak on behalf of the whole
country. U have been making for a

1781
00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:03.744
country. 1.I have been making for a
number of years

1782
00:54:03.744 --> 00:54:06.286
country. U have been making for a
number of years now is that we need

1783
00:54:06.286 --> 00:54:07.661
number of years now is that we need
to speak on behalf of the whole

1784
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:09.744
to speak on behalf of the whola
country. In

1785
00:54:09.744 --> 00:54:10.703
to speak on behalf of the whole
country. In large cities, we are

1786
00:54:10.703 --> 00:54:12.619
country. In large cities, we are
good at making our voice heard, but

1787
00:54:12.619 --> 00:54:13.911
good at making our voice heard, but
the smaller towns and cities and

1788
00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:16.536
the smaller towns and cities and
suburbs are not. One of the problems

1789
00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:18.161
suburbs are not. One of the problams
with

1790
00:54:18.161 --> 00:54:19.994
suburbs are not. One of the problems
with broadband was that it was

1791
00:54:19.994 --> 00:54:22.411
with broadband was that it was
practically the only policy that we

1792
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:23.786
practically the only policy that we
offered to those smaller towns and

1793
00:54:23.786 --> 00:54:27.286
offered to those smaller towns and
cities across Britain. We need to be

1794
00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:28.661
cities across Britain. We need to be
honest about the fact that it isn’t

1795
00:54:28.661 --> 00:54:31.869
honest about the fact that it isn’t
just the Tories who didn’t invest in

1796
00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:34.161
just the Tories who didn’t invest in
infrastructure. When we were in

1797
00:54:34.161 --> 00:54:34.453
infrastmclure. when we were in
government

1798
00:54:34.453 --> 00:54:35.703
infrastructure. When we were in
government and when areas had been

1799
00:54:35.703 --> 00:54:37.036
government and when areas had been
de—industrialised, we may have been

1800
00:54:37.036 --> 00:54:37.661
tie-industrialised, we may have been
good at

1801
00:54:37.661 --> 00:54:38.453
de—industrialised, we may have been
good at investing in schools and

1802
00:54:38.453 --> 00:54:40.453
good at investing in schools and
hospitals, but we were not dealing

1803
00:54:40.453 --> 00:54:41.911
hospitals, but we were not dealing
with the economy in those areas and

1804
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:43.744
with the economy in those areas and
we should never allow the situation

1805
00:54:43.744 --> 00:54:46.036
we should never allow the situation
to continue where if you are a

1806
00:54:46.036 --> 00:54:47.286
to continue where if you are a
youngster in a northern town, you

1807
00:54:47.286 --> 00:54:52.286
youngster in a northern town, you
say to your mum, sorry, mum, but

1808
00:54:52.286 --> 00:54:53.578
say to your mum, sorry, mum, but
there are very few opportunities

1809
00:54:53.578 --> 00:54:55.578
there are very few opportunities
here. I either have to suck it up or

1810
00:54:55.578 --> 00:54:58.661
here. I either have to suck it up or
move to London and the south—east.

1811
00:54:58.661 --> 00:54:59.203
move to London and the south-east.
Our economy is

1812
00:54:59.203 --> 00:54:59.994
move to London and the south—east.
Our economy is entirely unbalanced

1813
00:54:59.994 --> 00:55:02.578
Our economy is entirely unbalanced
and we need to have a radical look

1814
00:55:02.578 --> 00:55:04.494
and we need to have a radical look
at this and find solutions for that.

1815
00:55:04.494 --> 00:55:05.911
at this and find solutions for that.
That is what the Labour Party should

1816
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:09.036
That is what the labour Party should
be doing. We

1817
00:55:09.036 --> 00:55:10.286
That is what the Labour Party should
be doing. We have five years in

1818
00:55:10.286 --> 00:55:11.744
be doing. We have five years in
opposition to sort this out. We will

1819
00:55:11.744 --> 00:55:13.411
opposition to sort this out. We will
get a lot of rhetoric from the

1820
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:18.536
get a lot of rhetoric from the
Tories and the Times. They say they

1821
00:55:18.536 --> 00:55:20.494
Tories and the Times. They say they
were sort this problem out, but they

1822
00:55:20.494 --> 00:55:22.119
were sort this problem out, but they
won’t and we need to hold them to

1823
00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:24.411
won’t and we need to hold them to
account. Emily Thornberry is

1824
00:55:24.411 --> 00:55:25.953
account. Emily Thornberry is
accusing me of rhetoric? You have

1825
00:55:25.953 --> 00:55:30.036
accusing me of rhetoric? You have
rolled in so many themes there. I

1826
00:55:30.036 --> 00:55:35.119
rolled in so many themes there. I
was told I had to do it quickly! I

1827
00:55:35.119 --> 00:55:39.078
was told I had to do it quickly! I
was told I had 90 seconds. I never

1828
00:55:39.078 --> 00:55:40.494
was told I had 90 seconds. I never
said 90 seconds. You spoke very fast

1829
00:55:40.494 --> 00:55:44.536
said 90 seconds. You spoke very fast
about a tonne of things. You said,

1830
00:55:44.536 --> 00:55:46.661
about a tonne of things. You said,
we believed in what we said and if

1831
00:55:46.661 --> 00:55:48.244
we believed in what we said and if
people had only heard our passion

1832
00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:48.661
peopla had only heard our passion
and our

1833
00:55:48.661 --> 00:55:49.661
people had only heard our passion
and our belief, things could have

1834
00:55:49.661 --> 00:55:53.078
and our belief, things could have
been different. But your message was

1835
00:55:53.078 --> 00:56:00.203
been different. But your message was
wrong. No.

1836
00:56:01.078 --> 00:56:06.744
wrong. No. There are a couple of
people with hands up? I think that

1837
00:56:06.744 --> 00:56:07.661
peopla with hands up? I think that
Emily is right

1838
00:56:07.661 --> 00:56:08.453
people with hands up? I think that
Emily is right that Labour are going

1839
00:56:08.453 --> 00:56:09.036
Emily is right that labour are going
to be in

1840
00:56:09.036 --> 00:56:09.453
Emily is right that Labour are going
to be in opposition for

1841
00:56:09.453 --> 00:56:09.703
Emily is right that Labour are going
to be in opposition forfive

1842
00:56:09.703 --> 00:56:09.869
Emily is right that Labour are going
to be in opposition for five years

1843
00:56:09.869 --> 00:56:14.203
to be in opposition for five years
and there is not a lot they can do.

1844
00:56:14.203 --> 00:56:14.869
and there is not a lot they ran do.
But the

1845
00:56:14.869 --> 00:56:15.619
and there is not a lot they can do.
But the difference in the UK

1846
00:56:15.619 --> 00:56:18.203
But the difference in the UK
compared to somewhere like over

1847
00:56:18.203 --> 00:56:19.994
compared to somewhere like over
here, on the left and right, people

1848
00:56:19.994 --> 00:56:22.328
here, on the left and right, people
presume that if you don’t have

1849
00:56:22.328 --> 00:56:23.286
presume that if you don’t have
parliamentary or legislative power,

1850
00:56:23.286 --> 00:56:24.203
partiamentary or legislative power,
you can’t

1851
00:56:24.203 --> 00:56:24.786
parliamentary or legislative power,
you can’t have a significant

1852
00:56:24.786 --> 00:56:26.953
you can’t have a significant
political impact in this country.

1853
00:56:26.953 --> 00:56:28.536
political impact in this country.
Actually, if you look at France, you

1854
00:56:28.536 --> 00:56:30.869
Actually, if you look at France, you
peopla from all

1855
00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:31.328
Actually, if you look at France, you
people from all different comic

1856
00:56:31.328 --> 00:56:32.703
people from all different comic
backgrounds and religious

1857
00:56:32.703 --> 00:56:33.661
backgrounds and religious
backgrounds and people from

1858
00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:34.411
backgrounds and people from
different communities who are

1859
00:56:34.411 --> 00:56:37.828
different communities who are
pulling together and saying no, and

1860
00:56:37.828 --> 00:56:39.869
pulling together and saying no, and
they are getting results. They have

1861
00:56:39.869 --> 00:56:41.328
they are getting results. They have
got contentions from Macron and the

1862
00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:44.244
got contentions from Macron and the
pension reforms and that is the type

1863
00:56:44.244 --> 00:56:46.411
pension reforms and that is the type
of power that scares Boris Johnson,

1864
00:56:46.411 --> 00:56:46.661
of power that stares Boris johnson,
that

1865
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:47.744
of power that scares Boris Johnson,
that scares Theresa here and scared

1866
00:56:47.744 --> 00:56:47.994
that stares Theresa here and stared
Thatcher

1867
00:56:47.994 --> 00:56:49.661
that scares Theresa here and scared
Thatcher in 1990 when she tried to

1868
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:51.036
Thatcher in 1990 when she tried to
introduce the poll tax. And this

1869
00:56:51.036 --> 00:56:53.078
introduce the poll tax. And this
sort of pseudo— culture war that is

1870
00:56:53.078 --> 00:56:53.703
sort of pseudo- culture war that is
now being

1871
00:56:53.703 --> 00:56:54.411
sort of pseudo— culture war that is
now being laundered by the

1872
00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:55.411
now being laundered by the
mainstream press across the country

1873
00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:58.119
mainstream press across the country
at the moment is pitting people

1874
00:56:58.119 --> 00:56:58.369
at the moment is pitting peopla
against

1875
00:56:58.369 --> 00:57:01.244
at the moment is pitting people
against each other so that we don’t

1876
00:57:01.244 --> 00:57:04.286
against each other so that we don’t
come together and start to say no

1877
00:57:04.286 --> 00:57:05.786
come together and start to say no
and fight for our communities and

1878
00:57:05.786 --> 00:57:08.328
and fight for our communities and
fight for these cuts. Everybody in

1879
00:57:08.328 --> 00:57:10.036
fight for these cuts. Everybody in
this country, unless you are

1880
00:57:10.036 --> 00:57:11.661
this country, unless you are
incredibly rich, is worse off as a

1881
00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:13.911
incredibly rich, is worse off as a
result of ten years of Tory

1882
00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:15.828
result of ten years of Tory
austerity. So regardless of who wins

1883
00:57:15.828 --> 00:57:17.328
austerity. So regardless of who wins
the election, people need to come

1884
00:57:17.328 --> 00:57:20.994
the election, people need to come
together now and start resisting.

1885
00:57:20.994 --> 00:57:26.328
together now and start resisting.
Thank you very much. 0K, we have

1886
00:57:26.328 --> 00:57:28.911
Thank you very much. 0K, we have
time for one quick question from

1887
00:57:28.911 --> 00:57:32.744
time for one quick question from
Alastair Duncan.

1888
00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:37.786
Should politicians be subject
to lie detector tests?

1889
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:44.494
Theresa, I am assuming you are keen
on this because your proposed terror

1890
00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:46.953
on this because your proposed terror
reforms include plans to introduce

1891
00:57:46.953 --> 00:57:48.619
reforms include plans to introduce
detector tests. Would you be

1892
00:57:48.619 --> 00:57:53.494
detector tests. Would you be
prepared to be to one? Absolutely I

1893
00:57:53.494 --> 00:57:57.453
prepared to be to one? Absolutely I
would. I can’t see a widespread use

1894
00:57:57.453 --> 00:57:59.703
would. I can’t see a widespread use
for these. Hang on, your government

1895
00:57:59.703 --> 00:58:00.536
for these. Hang on, your government
is suggesting introducing a

1896
00:58:00.536 --> 00:58:02.453
is suggesting introducing a
widespread use for them with the new

1897
00:58:02.453 --> 00:58:03.619
widespread use for them with the new
terror legislation, or had you

1898
00:58:03.619 --> 00:58:08.203
terror legislation, or had you
forgotten that? That set of

1899
00:58:08.203 --> 00:58:09.744
forgotten that? That set of
proposals is worthwhile, but in

1900
00:58:09.744 --> 00:58:11.619
proposals is worthwhile, but in
terms of introducing them in

1901
00:58:11.619 --> 00:58:12.078
terms of introducing them in
politic, I’m

1902
00:58:12.078 --> 00:58:13.119
terms of introducing them in
politics, I’m not sure there is a

1903
00:58:13.119 --> 00:58:13.494
politic, I’m not sure there is a
use for

1904
00:58:13.494 --> 00:58:14.994
politics, I’m not sure there is a
case for that. But I would be more

1905
00:58:14.994 --> 00:58:15.286
use for that. But I would be more
than

1906
00:58:15.286 --> 00:58:16.244
rase for that. But I would be more
than happy to

1907
00:58:16.244 --> 00:58:17.286
case for that. But I would be more
than happy to take one of those

1908
00:58:17.286 --> 00:58:19.328
than happy to take one of those
tests. That would be quite a

1909
00:58:19.328 --> 00:58:22.328
tests. That would be quite a
Question Time, wouldn’t it? Let’s

1910
00:58:22.328 --> 00:58:25.244
Question Time, wouldn’t it? Let’s
say that I thought for a moment. We

1911
00:58:25.244 --> 00:58:32.703
say that I thought for a moment. We
have been using them since 2014. 11

1912
00:58:32.703 --> 00:58:34.203
have been using them since 2014. 11
forces used them with registered sex

1913
00:58:34.203 --> 00:58:36.286
forces used them with registered sex
offenders and 4000 people have taken

1914
00:58:36.286 --> 00:58:40.078
offenders and 4000 people have taken
the test and over 350 have failed.

1915
00:58:40.078 --> 00:58:40.661
the test and over 350 have failad.
That is

1916
00:58:40.661 --> 00:58:43.161
the test and over 350 have failed.
That is about 8%. And they have

1917
00:58:43.161 --> 00:58:43.578
That is about 896. And they have
either gone

1918
00:58:43.578 --> 00:58:46.494
That is about 8%. And they have
either gone back to prison or had a

1919
00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:50.744
either gone back to prison or had a
change in their regime. The lie

1920
00:58:50.744 --> 00:58:54.244
change in their regime. The lie
detector test puts pressure on

1921
00:58:54.244 --> 00:58:55.661
detector test puts pressure on
people that they need to tell the

1922
00:58:55.661 --> 00:58:58.953
people that they need to tell the
truth. I am

1923
00:58:58.953 --> 00:58:59.119
people that they need to tell the
truth. lam not

1924
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.286
people that they need to tell the
truth. I am not sure I am entirely

1925
00:59:00.286 --> 00:59:00.994
truth. lam not sure I am entirely
with the

1926
00:59:00.994 --> 00:59:02.411
truth. I am not sure I am entirely
with the man on the back row who has

1927
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:06.078
with the man on the back row who has
just spoken, but I do think there

1928
00:59:06.078 --> 00:59:07.661
just spoken, but I do think there
needs to be public discourse. You do

1929
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:12.328
needs to be public discourse. You do
need to see your MP. If the people

1930
00:59:12.328 --> 00:59:14.286
need to see your MP. If the people
in this audience haven’t been to see

1931
00:59:14.286 --> 00:59:16.369
in this audience haven’t been to see
your MP personally, shame on you.

1932
00:59:16.369 --> 00:59:17.661
your MP personally, shame on you.
Use that power to make sure they

1933
00:59:17.661 --> 00:59:17.828
Use that power to make sure they
tmly

1934
00:59:17.828 --> 00:59:20.494
Use that power to make sure they
truly represent. One of my worries

1935
00:59:20.494 --> 00:59:20.911
tmly represent. One of my worries
is that

1936
00:59:20.911 --> 00:59:23.911
truly represent. One of my worries
is that whenever you get a political

1937
00:59:23.911 --> 00:59:24.078
is that whenever you get a political
party

1938
00:59:24.078 --> 00:59:24.286
is that whenever you get a political
Party in.

1939
00:59:24.286 --> 00:59:25.119
is that whenever you get a political
party in, they don’t think they

1940
00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.078
party in, they don’t think they
represent the country, when they

1941
00:59:26.078 --> 00:59:30.328
represent the country, when they
actually do. I think a bit more

1942
00:59:30.328 --> 00:59:31.494
actually do. I think a bit more
Question Time love—in that you have

1943
00:59:31.494 --> 00:59:31.953
Question Time love-in that you have
seen tonight

1944
00:59:31.953 --> 00:59:34.578
Question Time love—in that you have
seen tonight might not go amiss. We

1945
00:59:34.578 --> 00:59:36.494
seen tonight might not go amiss. We
have about A0 seconds left to answer

1946
00:59:36.494 --> 00:59:36.703
have about 40 seconds left to answer
this.

1947
00:59:36.703 --> 00:59:41.286
have about A0 seconds left to answer
this. Trevor? To be honest, I don’t

1948
00:59:41.286 --> 00:59:45.036
this. Trevor? To be honest, I don’t
see what the point would be. I am

1949
00:59:45.036 --> 00:59:46.286
see what the point would be. I am
often more afraid of politicians

1950
00:59:46.286 --> 00:59:48.661
often more afraid of politicians
like Donald Trump who tell me what

1951
00:59:48.661 --> 00:59:48.994
like Donald Tmmp who tell me what
they really

1952
00:59:48.994 --> 00:59:49.786
like Donald Trump who tell me what
they really think, because when I

1953
00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.828
they really think, because when I
know what he really thinks, that is

1954
00:59:51.828 --> 00:59:57.203
know what he really thinks, that is
what scares me.

1955
00:59:57.494 --> 01:00:02.661
what scares me. I think we shouldn’t
be going around thinking that there

1956
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:05.244
be going around thinking that there
is some truth that we can all

1957
01:00:05.244 --> 01:00:06.578
is some truth that we ran all
discover.

1958
01:00:06.578 --> 01:00:07.286
is some truth that we can all
discover. Politics is about

1959
01:00:07.286 --> 01:00:08.078
discover. Politics is about
disagreement, and most politicians

1960
01:00:08.078 --> 01:00:11.953
disagreement, and most politicians
tell you what they do think. Because

1961
01:00:11.953 --> 01:00:14.411
tell you what they do think. Because
you disagree, it doesn’t mean they

1962
01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:19.286
you disagree, it doesn’t mean they
have lied. Sarah? The problem is not

1963
01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:20.328
have lied. Sarah? The problem is not
that the politicians lie, the

1964
01:00:20.328 --> 01:00:21.578
that the politicians lie, the
problem is that they believe their

1965
01:00:21.578 --> 01:00:26.828
problem is that they believe their
own BS.

1966
01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:29.453
own BS. We don’t need to put Boris
johnson to a lie

1967
01:00:29.453 --> 01:00:29.953
own BS. We don’t need to put Boris
Johnson to a lie detector test,

1968
01:00:29.953 --> 01:00:30.036
johnson to a lie detector test,
let’s

1969
01:00:30.036 --> 01:00:32.119
Johnson to a lie detector test,
let’s face it. He won’t face the

1970
01:00:32.119 --> 01:00:35.078
let’s face it. He won’t face the
media. He would rather hide in a

1971
01:00:35.078 --> 01:00:36.994
media. He would rather hide in a
freezer than talk to a journalist.

1972
01:00:36.994 --> 01:00:38.994
freezer than talk to a journalist.
One way in which he can be held to

1973
01:00:38.994 --> 01:00:39.244
One way in which he ran be held to
account

1974
01:00:39.244 --> 01:00:40.661
One way in which he can be held to
account and will not be able to run

1975
01:00:40.661 --> 01:00:41.036
account and will not be able to mn
away each

1976
01:00:41.036 --> 01:00:41.911
account and will not be able to run
away each week, the real lie

1977
01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:42.994
away each week, the real lie
detector test will be Prime

1978
01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:43.953
detector test will be Prime
Minister’s Questions each week, and

1979
01:00:43.953 --> 01:00:45.578
Minister’s Questions each week, and
we need to make sure we have a

1980
01:00:45.578 --> 01:00:47.661
we need to make sure we have a
decent leader who takes him on and

1981
01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:48.244
decent leader who takes him on and
ran expose him

1982
01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.286
decent leader who takes him on and
can expose him as the liar that he

1983
01:00:49.286 --> 01:00:51.161
ran expose him as the liar that he

1999
01:01:56.619 --> 01:01:58.703
No clear—cut cause of death,
I’m afraid.

2000
01:01:58.703 --> 01:02:00.536
Don’t give up on someone.

2001
01:02:00.536 --> 01:02:01.744
It’s blood.

2002
01:02:01.744 --> 01:02:02.994
She’s in stasis.

2003
01:02:02.994 --> 01:02:05.369
You’re researching cryogenics.

2004
01:02:05.369 --> 01:02:07.828
That little girl...

2005
01:02:07.828 --> 01:02:10.203
..is me.

2006
01:02:16.453 --> 01:02:18.786
Welcome to the FA Cup Fourth Round.

2007

Idiliiillllf

2008
01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.953
WHISTLE BLOWS
0h, sensational!

2009
01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:26.661
This is going to be
a terrific cup tie.

2010
01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:29.369
Vardy strikes again!

2011
01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:36.244
Oh, what a superb goal
for Fulham and Harry Arter.

2012
01:02:36.244 --> 01:02:37.536
Jones curls!

2013
01:02:37.536 --> 01:02:38.828
What a goal!

2014
01:02:38.828 --> 01:02:41.578
It’s an absolutely stunning goal!

2015
01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:45.411
That’s what the FA Cup’s all about.

2016
01:02:45.411 --> 01:02:48.369
What a way to start
the Fourth Round of the FA Cup.

2017
01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:51.161
A huge weekend of FA Cup action
kicks off with...

2018
01:03:11.536 --> 01:03:12.994
Brexitcast. ..
Brexitcast. ..

2019
01:03:12.994 --> 01:03:14.411
From the BBC.

2020
01:03:14.411 --> 01:03:16.786
DANNY DYER: No—one’s got a (BLEEP)
clue what Brexit is!

2021
01:03:16.786 --> 01:03:20.119
DONALD TRUMP: Brexit is, errr...

2022
01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:22.744
DOMINIC RAAB: I hadn’t quite
understood the full extent of this.

2023
01:03:22.744 --> 01:03:27.786
We are particularly reliant
on the Dover—Calais crossing.

2024
01:03:32.286 --> 01:03:34.203
KEIR STARMER: This election
blew away the argument

2025
01:03:34.203 --> 01:03:35.244
for a second referendum.

2026
01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.161
BORISJOHNSON: I urge
everyone to find closure.

2027
01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.203
Let the healing begin.

2028
01:03:38.203 --> 01:03:40.828
URSULA VON DER LEYEN: I am sorry.
We will miss you.

2029
01:03:40.828 --> 01:03:43.953
YANIS VAROUFAKIS: A process which I
can only describe as a dog’s Brexit.

2030
01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.328
Well, this is nice.

2031
01:03:45.328 --> 01:03:50.328
I’ve got some new friends.

2032
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:53.786
It’s like a new look Brexitcast
but only temporarily and I’ve got

2033
01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:56.203
the massive job of being Adam
and Chris in one.

2034
01:03:56.203 --> 01:03:58.286
I’m Alex Forsyth, PolCor,
political correspondent, BBC,

2035
01:03:58.286 --> 01:04:03.286
but I’m not sure I can live up
to the Adam/Chris reputation.

2036
01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:05.536
You can have your own
reputation, Alex.

2037
01:04:05.536 --> 01:04:08.203
You’re your own person.

2038
01:04:08.203 --> 01:04:13.203
That could be dangerous.

2039
01:04:13.911 --> 01:04:17.578
On your left?

2040
01:04:17.578 --> 01:04:20.203
I’n Matt Chorley, the editor
of the Times Red Box e—mail,

2041
01:04:20.203 --> 01:04:22.369
podcast and anything else
they get me to do.

2042
01:04:22.369 --> 01:04:23.744
And sometime stand—up
comedian, no less.

2043
01:04:23.744 --> 01:04:24.828
Yes.
No pressure.

2044
01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:26.494
You’re in charge of the jokes.
Fine.

2045
01:04:26.494 --> 01:04:27.578
Helen?

2046
01:04:27.578 --> 01:04:30.411
I’m not sure what I’m in charge
of but I’m Helen Lewis,

2047
01:04:30.411 --> 01:04:31.661
staff writer at the Atlantic.

2048
01:04:31.661 --> 01:04:34.244
And you are also allowed
to telljokes, by the way.

2049
01:04:34.244 --> 01:04:35.286
Yeah.

2050
01:04:35.286 --> 01:04:37.203
If Matt’s. . .
If one creeps out, that’s fine.

2051
01:04:37.203 --> 01:04:39.619
Or if Matt’s rubbish.
Or if Matt is not funny.

2052
01:04:39.619 --> 01:04:41.994
But one of my old, good,
best friends is still

2053
01:04:41.994 --> 01:04:43.203
with us but is in...

2054
01:04:43.203 --> 01:04:45.828
Bologna, yes, I’m in Bologna
and I was about to say,

2055
01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:47.328
enough of your new friends already!

2056
01:04:47.328 --> 01:04:50.453
We are just getting in while we can,
Katya, that’s all it is.

2057
01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:53.203
We’re just taking advantage of it.

2058
01:04:53.203 --> 01:04:58.203
Very nice to hear you.

2059
01:04:59.203 --> 01:05:01.119
Well, there was news
today, news, wasn’t it?

2060
01:05:01.119 --> 01:05:04.453
But in a bit of a quiet, weird way
because the Withdrawal Bill that

2061
01:05:04.453 --> 01:05:06.828
we’ve spent so much time on this
programme talking about...

2062
01:05:06.828 --> 01:05:08.286
Just has actually
become law, finally.

2063
01:05:08.286 --> 01:05:09.953
But blink and you miss
it, seriously.

2064
01:05:09.953 --> 01:05:10.994
Yeah.

2065
01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:13.661
I mean, all of those years
of my life, your life,

2066
01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:15.578
everyone’s life, the wrangling,
the pain, the agony,

2067
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.244
the "will be ever get there",
and it was literally blink

2068
01:05:18.244 --> 01:05:20.161
and you’ll miss it,
there we go, sorted.
