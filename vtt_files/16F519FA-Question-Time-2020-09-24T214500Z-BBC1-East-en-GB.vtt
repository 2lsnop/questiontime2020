1
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.980
the go ahead to a third river
crossing in Great Yarmouth.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.064
It will be in the south
of the town and will make it

3
00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:11.272
easier to reach the port.

4
00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:18.022
It will cost £120 million and
work should start early next year.

5
00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:22.939
That’s all for me. Alex has the
weather. Good night.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.939
Hello.

7
00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.730
We’ve been gradually eased
into autumn weather,

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.564
but over the next 2A hours,
it’s going to turn much colder,

9
00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:31.189
with a cold northerly wind and some
more scattered showers around.

10
00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.355
Now, overnight tonight,
there will be some further showers,

11
00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:36.439
the odd heavy one, then dry
for a time before we see another

12
00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.605
area of showery rain
moving in from the north—west.

13
00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.730
It will be accompanied
by a freshening northwesterly wind,

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.439
so certainly quite blustery
conditions by the end of the night.

15
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.314
During the course of the night,
some clear spells will allow our

16
00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:48.480
temperatures to drop to
around 6 or 7 degrees.

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.605
So, low pressure still
on the scene for tomorrow.

18
00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.980
It pulls away to the east,
establishing this northerly wind,

19
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.897
so expect a blustery forecast,
some scattered showers

20
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.439
in the morning.

21
00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.355
They will gradually clear away,
confining themselves mainly

22
00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:00.439
to eastern counties.

23
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.647
The West looking largely
dry but still blustery,

24
00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:05.272
and the potential there for
A0 mile an hour wind gusts.

25
00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:07.439
It’s going to feel cold,
12 or 13 degrees.

26
00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.022
It will feel colder still
in that northerly wind.

27
00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:11.939
In a moment, the national
weather’s coming up,

28
00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:12.980
but here’s the outlook.

29
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.147
And still windy to start
the weekend, with some

30
00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.439
further showers to come.

31
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.439
Hello there. If you went outside on
Thursday you might have noticed the

32
00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:30.814
Thursday you might have noticed the
weather feeling

33
00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:31.397
Thursday you might have noticed the
weatherfeeling more

34
00:01:31.397 --> 00:01:31.814
Thursday you might have noticed the
weather feeling more autumnal but

35
00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:35.064
weather feeling more autumnal but
was it really cold enough for snow?

36
00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:36.939
was it really cold enough for snow?
Not really, no. This was a massive

37
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.730
Not really, no. This was a massive
hailstorm that went through Bradford

38
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.272
hailstorm that went through Bradford
and Otley, turning the roads and

39
00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:42.564
and Oﬂey, turning the roads and
pavements

40
00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:43.022
and Otley, turning the roads and
pavements white with accumulations

41
00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:45.480
pavements white with accumulations
of hail. It must have been quite a

42
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.772
of hail. It must have been quite a
thunderstorm to do that. We have

43
00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:49.272
thunderstorm to do that. We have
loads more showers overnight, low

44
00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:50.189
loads more showers overnight, low
pressure in England slowly moving

45
00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.814
pressure in England slowly moving
towards the North Sea with loads of

46
00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:54.147
towards the North Sea with loads of
showers around. Pembrokeshire and

47
00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.480
showers around. Pembrokeshire and
Cornwall picking up some

48
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.897
Cornwall picking up some
particularly heavy showers. A few

49
00:01:57.897 --> 00:01:58.147
particularty heavy showers. A few
for

50
00:01:58.147 --> 00:01:58.689
particularly heavy showers. A few
for Northern Ireland, Scotland

51
00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.897
for Northern Ireland, Scotland
seeing some clearer skies and a

52
00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:00.355
seeing some dearer skies and a
touch of

53
00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:01.814
seeing some clearer skies and a
touch of frost in some of the

54
00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:03.730
touch of frost in some of the
sheltered valleys in Scotland.

55
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.564
sheltered valleys in Scotland.
Another cold night. Tomorrow, it’s a

56
00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:07.189
Another cold night. Tomorrow, it’s a
day broadly speaking of sunshine and

57
00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.730
day broadly speaking of sunshine and
showers but we have lengthy

58
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.397
showers but we have lengthy
outbreaks of rain across eastern

59
00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.439
outbreaks of rain across eastern
areas and some very strong northerly

60
00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.355
areas and some very strong northerty
winds.

61
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:14.355
areas and some very strong northerly
winds. Around the north—east coast

62
00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:15.397
winds. Around the north-east coast
in East Anglia

63
00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:16.230
winds. Around the north—east coast
in East Anglia we could see winds

64
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.564
in East Anglia we could see winds
gusting to 60 odd miles an hour and

65
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:19.230
gusting to 60 odd milas an hour and
they could be

66
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.230
gusting to 60 odd miles an hour and
they could be strong enough to bring

67
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.814
they could be strong enough to bring
down a tree or two so they could be

68
00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:23.730
down a tree or two so they could be
localised transport disruption and

69
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.064
localised transport dismption and
if not

70
00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:25.439
localised transport disruption and
if not from the strong winds, from

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.397
if not from the strong winds, from
the rain which will mount up. A

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:33.564

will feel a

will feel a lot colder than it did

78

scared about anything in my life.

Job Support Scheme help those who
still have their industry shut or

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:24.855
still have their industry shut or
massively reduced because of the

183
00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:28.105
massively reduced because of the
pandemic? We heard about the

184
00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:28.272
massively reduced because of the
pandemic? We heard about theJob

185
00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:28.397
pandemic? We heard about the job
Support

186
00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:29.314
pandemic? We heard about theJob
Support Scheme today from the

187
00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:32.772
Support Scheme today from the
Chancellor. It was welcome to see

188
00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:34.064
Chancellor. It was welcome to see
the Chancellor announced some of the

189
00:07:34.064 --> 00:07:35.355
the Chancellor announced some of the
measures today. Labour has been

190
00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:35.730
measures today. labour has been
falling for

191
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.522
measures today. Labour has been
calling for several months now for

192
00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:37.897
falling for several months now for
the furlough

193
00:07:37.897 --> 00:07:40.647
calling for several months now for
the furlough scheme to be extended

194
00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:42.480
the furlough scheme to be extended
in a targeted and specific way to

195
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.314
in a targeted and specific way to
address exactly the industries you

196
00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:45.272
address exactly the industries you
have just mentioned, those

197
00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:46.855
have just mentioned, those
industries which are still not able

198
00:07:46.855 --> 00:07:48.397
industries which are still not able
to be up and running because of

199
00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:48.647
to be up and mnning because of
social

200
00:07:48.647 --> 00:07:49.189
to be up and running because of
social distancing and lockdown

201
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:53.022
social distancing and lockdown
measures. Do you think this goes far

202
00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:54.314
measures. Do you think this goes far
enough in terms of industries which

203
00:07:54.314 --> 00:07:58.605
enough in terms of industries which
have been shut or massively reduced?

204
00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:00.647
have been shut or massively reduced?
No, there are not the measures for

205
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:01.897
No, there are not the measures for
those industries that are not yet

206
00:08:01.897 --> 00:08:03.105
those industries that are not yet
viable because the law doesn’t allow

207
00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:05.480
viable because the law doesn’t allow
them to be, there are not measures

208
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.439
them to be, there are not measures
for people that are self—employed

209
00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.147
for peopla that are self-employed
and

210
00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:08.730
for people that are self—employed
and cannot get back to work, and we

211
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.939
and cannot get back to work, and we
have to be honest and recognise

212
00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:10.855
have to be honest and recognise
there is a jobs

213
00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:14.105
have to be honest and recognise
there is 3 jobs crisis here and now.

214
00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:14.230
there is a jobs crisis here and now.
750,000

215
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.064
there is 3 jobs crisis here and now.
750,000 people have lost their

216
00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:15.230
there is 3 jobs crisis here and now.
750,000 people have lost theirjobs

217
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.689
750,000 peopla have lost theirjobs
already this

218
00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:20.147
750,000 people have lost theirjobs
already this year. That 750,000

219
00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:21.564
already this year. That 750,000
personal tragedies, and I didn’t

220
00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:22.522
personal tragedies, and I didn’t
hear anything from the Chancellor

221
00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:24.105
hear anything from the Chancellor
today about retraining or about

222
00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:27.022
today about retraining or about
creating new

223
00:08:27.022 --> 00:08:28.605
today about retraining or about
creating newjobs and, with the

224
00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:30.397
creating newjobs and, with the
measures as they are, not being

225
00:08:30.397 --> 00:08:31.605
measures as they are, not being
anywhere near significant enough to

226
00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:33.105
anywhere near significant enough to
protect against a second wave of

227
00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:33.355
anywhere near significant enough to
protect against a second wave ofjob

228
00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:35.314
protect against a second wave ofjob
losses, I would say increasing an

229
00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:38.730
losses, I would say increasing an
implement is inevitable. So would

230
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:38.814
implement is inevitable. So would
labour

231
00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:42.855
implement is inevitable. So would
Labour do more and spend more? Yes,

232
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.480
labour do more and spend more? Yes,
we need a

233
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.230
Labour do more and spend more? Yes,
we need a retraining programme and

234
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.980
we need a retraining programme and
targeted, specific support for those

235
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.272
targeted, specific support for those
sectors, because frankly there is a

236
00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:50.772
sectors, because frankly there is a
of not doing this. There is a cost

237
00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:54.855
of not doing this. There is a cost
at the end of this anyway. Yes, and

238
00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:57.105
at the end of this anyway. Yes, and
that is why we have already borrowed

239
00:08:57.105 --> 00:08:58.480
that is why we have already borrowed
a significant amount, because this

240
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.814
a significant amount, because this
pandemic is significant and we have

241
00:08:59.814 --> 00:09:01.689
pandemic is significant and we have
to match the scale of action with

242
00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:03.314
to match the scale of action with
the scale of the challenge and

243
00:09:03.314 --> 00:09:04.730
the scale of the challenge and
acknowledge that, as well as saving

244
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.689
acknowledge that, as well as saving
lives, we have to save livelihoods.

245
00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:10.730
lives, we have to save livelihoods.
Peter, you won a change of pubs,

246
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.397
Peter, you won a change of pubs,
upmarket pubs and restaurants. ——

you mn. Do you

you run. Do you think this goes far

enough? will it

00:09:18.522 --> 00:09:19.189
you run. Do you think this goes far
enough? Will it help you? Our

251
00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:20.980
enough? Will it help you? Our
business is doing well, and what the

252
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.397
business is doing well, and what the
Chancellor has done this year has

253
00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:24.980
Chancellor has done this year has
been very positive for my entire

254
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.189
been very positive for my entire
industry and certainly very good for

255
00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:31.355
industry and certainly very good for
Oakman Inns, my business. However, I

256
00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:34.605
Oakman Inns, my business. However, I
would urge the Chancellor to look

257
00:09:34.605 --> 00:09:38.272
would urge the Chancellor to look
again at some detail and look at

258
00:09:38.272 --> 00:09:40.314
again at some detail and look at
sectors on a granular basis. To pick

259
00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:40.647
sectors on a granular basis. To pick
“P

260
00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:41.730
sectors on a granular basis. To pick
up one example, because there are

261
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.189
up one example, because there are
several parts of the hospitality

262
00:09:43.189 --> 00:09:44.730
several parts of the hospitality
industry which will continue to

263
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.064
industry which will continue to
stmggle. If

264
00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:48.522
industry which will continue to
struggle. If you take nightclubs,

265
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:49.355
stmggle. If you take nightclubs,
so... They

266
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:49.980
struggle. If you take nightclubs,
so... They have been shut

267
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.730
so... They have been shut
throughout. They are not allowed to

268
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:59.147
throughout. They are not allowed to
open. Been preparing to open.

269
00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:01.855
open. Been preparing to open. I
spoke to the chief executive of a

270
00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:02.814
spoke to the chief executive of a
professional nightclub company today

271
00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:05.272
professional nightclub company today
and he has been preparing to open,

272
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:07.272
and he has been preparing to open,
investing in capital, he has kept

273
00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:08.814
investing in capital, he has kept
his team on, he has brought people

274
00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:09.772
his team on, he has brought peopla
off furlough to

275
00:10:09.772 --> 00:10:10.189
his team on, he has brought people
off furlough to prepare the

276
00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:11.230
off furlough to prepare the
marketing and make sure everything

277
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.022
marketing and make sure everything
is Covid secure. So this is no use

278
00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:17.855
is Covid secure. So this is no use
to him. None at all. But I hope the

279
00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:20.689
to him. None at all. But I hope the
government will be looking further.

280
00:10:20.689 --> 00:10:22.689
government will be looking further.
They have had to do a lot in a short

281
00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:26.564
They have had to do a lot in a short
period of time, but if a business is

282
00:10:26.564 --> 00:10:28.689
period of time, but if a business is
not allowed to open, it’s surely

283
00:10:28.689 --> 00:10:30.064
not allowed to open, it’s surely
still a viable business afterwards,

284
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:30.522
still a viabla business afterwards,
when it

285
00:10:30.522 --> 00:10:31.064
still a viable business afterwards,
when it can open, so

286
00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:31.314
still a viable business afterwards,
when it can open, sol

287
00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:31.730
still a viable business afterwards,
when it can open, so I think you

288
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.355
when it ran open, so I think you
have to

289
00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:34.314
when it can open, so I think you
have to separate a business which is

290
00:10:34.314 --> 00:10:38.897
have to separate a business which is
never going to succeed again, but

291
00:10:38.897 --> 00:10:40.064
never going to succeed again, but
Peter Marks’s

292
00:10:40.064 --> 00:10:41.064
never going to succeed again, but
Peter Marks’s customers are ready to

293
00:10:41.064 --> 00:10:43.689
Peter Marks’s customers are ready to
come back, they want to come back.

294
00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:44.939
come back, they want to come back.
If the government, for public health

295
00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:45.939
If the government, for public health
reasons, will not allow nightclubs

296
00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:49.814
reasons, will not allow nightclubs
to open, I guess it can get to

297
00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:51.689
to open, I guess it can get to
understand that, but there must be

298
00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:52.689
understand that, but there must be
support so these businesses are

299
00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:56.064
support so these businesses are
still there to reopen, and they are

300
00:10:56.064 --> 00:10:57.689
still there to reopen, and they are
a big part of the economy, in due

301
00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:00.522
a big part of the economy, in due
course. You could also talk about

302
00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:02.105
course. You could also talk about
theatres and life events, all sorts

303
00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:05.647
theatres and life events, all sorts
of companies, industries, rather.

304
00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:09.855
of companies, industries, rather.
Catherine, you have your hand up.

305
00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:11.314
Catherine, you have your hand up.
I’d like to agree with what the

306
00:11:11.314 --> 00:11:12.439
I’d like to agree with what the
gentleman has just said about the

307
00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.355
gentleman has just said about the
government may be needing to look at

308
00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:16.105
government may be needing to look at
the industries in a more granular

309
00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:20.980
the industries in a more granular
lavel. My

310
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.022
the industries in a more granular
level. My company is a company which

311

lavel. My company is a company which
provides a day

312
00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:23.230
level. My company is a company which
provides a day service for adults

313
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.189
provides a day service for adults
over 50 with disabilities, and my

314
00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:27.980
over 50 with disabilities, and my
company is closed at the moment and

315
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.939
company is closed at the moment and
the clients that we have are not

316
00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:33.147
the clients that we have are not
offered any provision and haven’t

317
00:11:33.147 --> 00:11:35.314
offered any provision and haven’t
been offered any provision since the

318
00:11:35.314 --> 00:11:41.230
been offered any provision since the
lockdown started. It’s my company ——

319
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.814
lockdown started. It’s my company --
is my company not

320
00:11:42.814 --> 00:11:43.647
lockdown started. It’s my company ——
is my company not viable and, if so,

321
00:11:43.647 --> 00:11:44.314
is my company not viabla and, if so,
what happens to

322
00:11:44.314 --> 00:11:45.147
is my company not viable and, if so,
what happens to these people in the

323
00:11:45.147 --> 00:11:49.605
what happens to these people in the
long term? These people now are

324
00:11:49.605 --> 00:11:50.814
long term? These people now are
suffering from, in many cases, being

325
00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:52.355
suffering from, in many rases, being
isolated. They

326
00:11:52.355 --> 00:11:52.939
suffering from, in many cases, being
isolated. They don’t always have

327
00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:55.355
isolated. They don’t always have
family or friends that can keep in

328
00:11:55.355 --> 00:11:55.564
family or friends that ran keep in
touch

329
00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:58.939
family or friends that can keep in
touch with them, and the day centre

330
00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:01.522
touch with them, and the day centre
was a bit of a lifeline for them, so

331
00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:05.980
was a bit of a lifeline for them, so
what happens to them in future? I

332
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.980
what happens to them in future? I
wanted to reiterate those two

333
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.939
wanted to reiterate those two
points.

334
00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:15.105
points. It’s such an ambiguous
thing, and this is the whole point

335
00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:15.480
thing, and this is the whola point
of what

336
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.689
thing, and this is the whole point
of what we talk about in dialogue

337
00:12:17.689 --> 00:12:19.189
of what we talk about in dialogue
with the public, when you say viable

338
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.772
with the public, when you say viabla
job, what they

339
00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:24.772
with the public, when you say viable
job, what they mean?

340
00:12:25.272 --> 00:12:28.355
job, what they mean? I think there
is a big problem here, that there is

341
00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:30.480
is a big problem here, that there is
going to be a whole generation of

342
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.897
going to be a whola generation of
peopla that

343
00:12:30.897 --> 00:12:32.314
going to be a whole generation of
people that are going to be thrown

344
00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:33.147
peopla that are going to be thrown
onto the pila

345
00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:34.980
people that are going to be thrown
onto the pile of trash by missing

346
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.980
onto the pila of trash by missing
out on

347
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.189
onto the pile of trash by missing
out on the scheme, and it’s going to

348
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:41.105
out on the scheme, and it’s going to
really, really damage the economy,

349
00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:43.772
really, really damage the economy,
it’s going to damage the country’s

350
00:12:43.772 --> 00:12:45.439
it’s going to damage the countrrs
future

351
00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:47.022
it’s going to damage the country’s
future prospects, we are going to be

352
00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:49.355
future prospects, we are going to be
losing all of those future tax

353
00:12:49.355 --> 00:12:50.730
losing all of those future tax
revenues that we need to actually

354
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.980
revenues that we need to actually
start to grow the economy again in

355
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.772
start to grow the economy again in
another six or 12 months or a couple

356
00:12:55.772 --> 00:12:57.939
another six or 12 months or a couple
of years down the line. We are going

357
00:12:57.939 --> 00:12:59.147
of years down the line. We are going
to need all of these creative

358
00:12:59.147 --> 00:13:01.855
to need all of these creative
industries and the nightclub

359
00:13:01.855 --> 00:13:02.855
industries and the nightclub
industry and the social industries

360
00:13:02.855 --> 00:13:06.730
industry and the social industries
that actually drive our UK economy,

361
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.522
that actually drive our UK economy,
a consumer led economy. We need to

362
00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:09.939
a consumer led economy. We need to
PWP “P

363
00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:13.189
a consumer led economy. We need to
prop up these industries, because

364
00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:15.064
prop up these industries, because
that will prop up the long—term

365
00:13:15.064 --> 00:13:15.439
that will prop up the long-term
recovery of

366
00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:16.189
that will prop up the long—term
recovery of the economy in the

367
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:21.147
recovery of the economy in the
future. What do you say, Alok

368
00:13:21.147 --> 00:13:21.355
future. what do you say, Alok
Sharma?

369
00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:22.439
future. What do you say, Alok
Sharma? We have had three people

370
00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:24.939
Sharma? We have had three people
from the audience, and Rishi Sunak

371
00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:27.730
from the audience, and Rishi Sunak
made it quite clear this support was

372
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.230
made it quite clear this support was
for peopla

373
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.439
made it quite clear this support was
for people with the viable jobs, but

374
00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:31.064
for peopla with the viabla jobs, but
jobs that are

375
00:13:31.064 --> 00:13:32.230
for people with the viable jobs, but
jobs that are not viable now, like

376
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.397
jobs that are not viabla now, like
theatres

377
00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:33.272
jobs that are not viable now, like
theatres and nightclubs, will become

378
00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:33.689
theatres and nightclubs, will become
viabla again

379
00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:36.730
theatres and nightclubs, will become
viable again we are through this? I

380
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:36.897
viabla again we are through this? I
spend

381
00:13:36.897 --> 00:13:37.730
viable again we are through this? I
spend every day talking to

382
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.605
spend every day talking to
businesses, business organisations,

383
00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:43.022
businesses, business organisations,
and I know it’s very difficult for

384
00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.689
and I know it’s very difficult for
lots of sectors will stop we do

385
00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:47.147
lots of sectors will stop we do
understand that. I think what we

386
00:13:47.147 --> 00:13:48.439
understand that. I think what we
have seen from the Chancellor today

387
00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:49.980
have seen from the Chancellor today
is a set of measures which have been

388
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.772
is a set of measures which have been
very welcomed by business, and the

389
00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:55.980
very welcomed by business, and the
CBI describing them as a decisive

390
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.855
CBI describing them as a decisive
set of measures. If you look at

391
00:13:59.855 --> 00:14:00.939
set of measures. If you look at
those individual measures, yes, they

392
00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:02.605
those individual measures, yes, they
are there to support people coming

393
00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:02.939
are there to support peopla coming
back into

394
00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:04.189
are there to support people coming
back into work, but they are also an

395
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:06.939
back into work, but they are also an
extension of the loan schemes in

396
00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:09.314
extension of the loan schemes in
terms of the time limits on those,

397
00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:10.855
terms of the time limits on those,
in terms of how long people have to

398
00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:11.439
in terms of how long peopla have to
pay back the

399
00:14:11.439 --> 00:14:12.522
in terms of how long people have to
pay back the loans they have taken.

400
00:14:12.522 --> 00:14:15.314
pay back the loans they have taken.
We talk about individual sectors, we

401
00:14:15.314 --> 00:14:18.105
We talk about individual sectors, we
had this discussion earlier, there

402
00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:18.480
had this discussion eartier, there
has been

403
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.605
had this discussion earlier, there
has been targeted support. If you

404
00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:22.730
has been targeted support. If you
look at the hospitality and leisure

405
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.355
look at the hospitality and loisure
sector,

406
00:14:23.355 --> 00:14:25.605
look at the hospitality and leisure
sector, they have a one year holiday

407
00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:27.689
sector, they have a one year holiday
when it comes to rates. That is

408
00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:28.730
when it comes to rates. That is
continuing. The Chancellor has

409
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.314
continuing. The Chancellor has
announced a set of measures in terms

410
00:14:30.314 --> 00:14:31.855
announced a set of measures in terms
of allowing people longer to pay

411
00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:32.064
of allowing peopla longer to pay
their

412
00:14:32.064 --> 00:14:35.230
of allowing people longer to pay
their VAT deferrals. There are a

413
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.439
their VAT deferrals. There are a
whole range of things, and this

414
00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:36.605
whola range of things, and this
builds

415
00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:40.397
whole range of things, and this
builds on the almost £200 billion of

416
00:14:40.397 --> 00:14:41.605
builds on the almost £200 billion of
support where we have helped 12

417
00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:44.605
support where we have helped 12
million people stay in work. What

418
00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:44.772
million peopla stay in work. what
about

419
00:14:44.772 --> 00:14:46.980
million people stay in work. What
about the point made by the audience

420
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.605
about the point made by the audience
that the jobs that cannot exist,

421
00:14:48.605 --> 00:14:50.397
that the jobs that cannot exist,
even on a part—time basis at the

422
00:14:50.397 --> 00:14:50.605
even on a part-time basis at the
moment,

423
00:14:50.605 --> 00:14:53.480
even on a part—time basis at the
moment, because of restrictions we

424
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.980
moment, because of restrictions we
are in, which the government has

425
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.772
are in, which the government has
imposed on us, those

426
00:14:55.772 --> 00:14:56.522
are in, which the government has
imposed on us, thosejobs are not

427
00:14:56.522 --> 00:14:56.814
imposed on us, those jobs are not
viabla now

428
00:14:56.814 --> 00:15:00.855
imposed on us, thosejobs are not
viable now but they will come back.

429
00:15:00.855 --> 00:15:01.189
viabla now but they will come back.
So will

430
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:02.189
viable now but they will come back.
So will those people be thrown on

431
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.355
So will those peopla be thrown on
the

432
00:15:02.355 --> 00:15:05.314
So will those people be thrown on
the scrapheap? That is not obviously

433
00:15:05.314 --> 00:15:08.189
the scrapheap? That is not obviously
the intention at all. But is that

434
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:12.939
the intention at all. But is that
not the outcome? Support is

435
00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:14.272
not the outcome? Support is
available for those, and the

436
00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:15.355
available for those, and the
furlough scheme is continuing until

437
00:15:15.355 --> 00:15:20.189
furlough scheme is continuing until
the end of October. But after that.

438
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:22.522
the end of October. But after that.
In the creative industries, there is

439
00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:23.189
In the creative industries, there is
a £1.5

440
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.355
In the creative industries, there is
3 £1.5 million

441
00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:23.939
In the creative industries, there is
a £1.5 million package put forward

442
00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:24.730
a £1.5 million package put forward
after that,

443
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.022
3 £1.5 million package put forward
afterthat, but

444
00:15:25.022 --> 00:15:26.689
a £1.5 million package put forward
after that, but the other point is,

445
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:27.439
after that, but the other point is,
and Louise talked about

446
00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:29.397
and Louise talked about
traineeships, if you look at what

447
00:15:29.397 --> 00:15:31.147
traineeships, if you look at what
the Chancellor announced in his

448
00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:33.064
the Chancellor announced in his
summer statement, there was £30

449
00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:34.230
summer statement, there was 50
billion of

450
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.022
summer statement, there was £30
billion of support for green jobs,

451
00:15:35.022 --> 00:15:35.855
billion of support for green jobs,
support for traineeships, support

452
00:15:35.855 --> 00:15:38.480
support for traineeships, support
for young people through the

453
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.147
for young people through the
kick—start scheme, support for

454
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.397
kick—start scheme, support for
apprenticeships. There is a lot we

455
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:44.980
apprenticeships. There is a lot we
are doing, one, to support people

456
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:45.480
are doing, one, to support peopla
who are in

457
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.730
are doing, one, to support people
who are in work now, so they can

458
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.230
who are in work now, so they ran
come back,

459
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.022
who are in work now, so they can
come back, even for a small

460
00:15:48.022 --> 00:15:49.272
come back, even for a small
percentage of time, but then also

461
00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:52.730
percentage of time, but then also
ensuring that we are supporting the

462
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.480
ensuring that we are supporting the
creation of new

463
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:53.980
ensuring that we are supporting the
creation of newjobs and helping

464
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:54.397
creation of new jobs and helping
peopla to

465
00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:58.730
creation of newjobs and helping
people to get retrained.

466
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.939
May I make a point
about the bank debt?

467
00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:05.897
So, I spoke to another industry
colleague today and he had agreed

468
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.355
a CBil which enabled him to keep
on funding his business,

469
00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:12.939
without the help of furlough, long
enough for when the restrictions

470
00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:15.647
are lifted, he could reopen,
but of course it was right

471
00:16:15.647 --> 00:16:18.480
at the last stage, and the bank
told him today, because of

472
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.397
the new government restrictions,
we don’t think this is a good bet

473
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.022
any more, you won’t be getting it.

474
00:16:23.022 --> 00:16:24.522
So he is completely stranded now.

475
00:16:24.522 --> 00:16:28.814
And not sure what to do next, so,
again, I don’t want to be

476
00:16:28.814 --> 00:16:31.522
overly critical, Alok,
I’m just asking you to go back

477
00:16:31.522 --> 00:16:34.397
and look at some specific detail,
for notjust my sector,

478
00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:36.272
but for similarly affected sectors.

479
00:16:36.272 --> 00:16:38.647
There is a difference
between a business that is not

480
00:16:38.647 --> 00:16:43.689
viable, because customers don’t
want to use it and one

481
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.355
that is not allowed
to operate, or there are laws

482
00:16:47.355 --> 00:16:50.022
restricting its operation in such
a way, that it is not

483
00:16:50.022 --> 00:16:51.064
economic to operate.

484
00:16:51.064 --> 00:16:53.730
If I mayjust come back
on the point, the start

485
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.730
of that process, I,
the Chancellor and others...

486
00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:05.439
Everyone who is not familiar
with that acronym, CBils...

487
00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:07.605
It is the coronavirus business
interruption and loan scheme,

488
00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:10.480
it is one of the loan schemes
we have introduced and over

489
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.855
a million businesses have been
supported through the bounce back

490
00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:14.314
loans and other schemes as well.

491
00:17:14.314 --> 00:17:17.189
What we have been very keen on,
is to continue to impress

492
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:20.314
upon the banks, they need to support
businesses and I was being very

493
00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:23.189
clear in the House, in terms
of press conferences that took place

494
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:25.855
at Downing Street, that this
is a time for the banks

495
00:17:25.855 --> 00:17:28.189
to step up and support
and there is an underwritten

496
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:30.397
guarantee from the government
as well, when it comes,

497
00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:31.439
up to 80%.

498
00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:34.314
I cannot comment on individual
cases, but the fact that we have

499
00:17:34.314 --> 00:17:37.189
seen over a million businesses now
supported through loan schemes

500
00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.980
suggests that it is working.

501
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.605
I understand, there will be people
that fall through the gaps.

502
00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:43.230
Iqbal.

503
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.355
Hi there.

504
00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:51.355
I was just thinking
about the term viable business.

505
00:17:51.814 --> 00:17:54.689
A friend of mine is self—employed,
he is basically a one—man limited

506
00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:58.022
company, he was not eligible for any
help in their furlough scheme,

507
00:17:58.022 --> 00:18:02.022
so he is living off his savings
for about six months.

508
00:18:02.022 --> 00:18:04.730
Rishi’s new scheme is also not
going to give him anything,

509
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.730
so again he has got to keep relying
upon his savings.

510
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.730
Itjust seems very unfair that
because he is deemed

511
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.855
a non—viable business,
that even though he is not

512
00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:15.564
claiming benefits and he has
always been employed,

513
00:18:15.564 --> 00:18:19.397
that he could end up
losing his business and having

514
00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:22.480
to have a complete rethink
of what he does when all this has

515
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.730
happened and yet, in the past,
self—employed companies have been

516
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.022
able to take grants,
even if their own business

517
00:18:29.022 --> 00:18:31.855
was booming at the time.

518
00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:34.397
Who decides what is viable?

519
00:18:34.397 --> 00:18:36.730
Well, if we talk about the self
employment scheme...

520
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.897
Briefly, because I have
everybody else here as well.

521
00:18:38.897 --> 00:18:43.897
Of course, I am sorry.

522
00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:47.397
No, no, no, is Rishi Sunak deciding
what is a viable business?

523
00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:48.397
Are you deciding?

524
00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:51.064
I think, just going back
to the point about the self

525
00:18:51.064 --> 00:18:52.980
employment scheme, of course
there is additional support

526
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.189
that the Chancellor announced today.

527
00:18:54.189 --> 00:18:56.105
Who is deciding what
is a viable business?

528
00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:58.730
Ultimately, it is where businesses
are bringing people back to work

529
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.855
and they are spending at least
a third of their time in employment

530
00:19:01.855 --> 00:19:04.980
and the scheme will work
on the basis that you are in work,

531
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.105
being paid by your employer
for at least a third of the time

532
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:11.230
and then the rest of the wage bill
is effectively shared between you,

533
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.855
the employer and the government.

534
00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:18.564
It is whether the company believes
it is worth the investment.

535
00:19:18.564 --> 00:19:20.230
Richard.

536
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.689
Thanks, Fiona.

537
00:19:24.689 --> 00:19:27.272
A question for both Alok and Louise,
since they have both

538
00:19:27.272 --> 00:19:28.314
mentioned retraining.

539
00:19:28.314 --> 00:19:30.939
How is that supposed to happen
in a socially distanced environment,

540
00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:33.855
before people get back to some
sort of normality?

541
00:19:33.855 --> 00:19:37.480
I can imagine apprenticeship schemes
and things like that

542
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.022
are going to rely more on practical
hands—on face—to—face

543
00:19:41.022 --> 00:19:43.397
contact and communication,
rather than being able

544
00:19:43.397 --> 00:19:46.397
to do stuff virtually.

545
00:19:46.397 --> 00:19:49.522
So, it is a question on how training
can operate and apprenticeships can

546
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.730
operate in this current environment.

547
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.397
Because we haven’t yet heard
from the rest of the panel,

548
00:19:54.397 --> 00:19:57.230
I am going to keep going round,
Richard, if you forgive me.

549
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.272
Ed.

550
00:19:58.272 --> 00:19:59.355
Thanks, Fiona.

551
00:19:59.355 --> 00:20:02.689
I have been talking to a lot
of businesses, a lot of people over

552
00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:05.814
the last few weeks and months
and I have never seen the level

553
00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:07.230
of anxiety that we have got.

554
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.897
People are really worried that
their businesses are going to fold,

555
00:20:09.897 --> 00:20:12.272
that they are going to lose
theirjobs and while,

556
00:20:12.272 --> 00:20:14.439
like Louise, I welcome some
of the packages today,

557
00:20:14.439 --> 00:20:16.814
I just don’t think it goes
anywhere near far enough.

558
00:20:16.814 --> 00:20:19.230
Take the example that Iqbal
mentioned, there are a lot

559
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.397
of self—employed people who got
nothing in the previous

560
00:20:21.397 --> 00:20:22.480
support package.

561
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.397
Over a million people
who are excluded, they

562
00:20:24.397 --> 00:20:25.397
are not covered today.

563
00:20:25.397 --> 00:20:27.480
So what would you do differently?

564
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.522
Well, you should bring them
into the self employment scheme

565
00:20:35.647 --> 00:20:37.772
that was there and it
should be more generous.

566
00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:39.730
Talking about Peter,
he is quite right, there

567
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.855
are a number of sectors,
I would include nurseries,

568
00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:44.272
I would include tourism,
sectors that are just not able

569
00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:47.397
to operate and they are viable
businesses and it is just not good

570
00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:50.564
enough for the Secretary of State
to say they are going to forget

571
00:20:50.564 --> 00:20:52.855
them, because why should these
businesses, why should these people

572
00:20:52.855 --> 00:20:54.355
lose theirjobs,
lose their businesses,

573
00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:59.314
because of the random impact
of a virus?

574
00:20:59.564 --> 00:21:01.105
We have got to build back.

575
00:21:01.105 --> 00:21:03.355
I can see no long—term
strategy for the government.

576
00:21:03.355 --> 00:21:04.730
They made a mistake as well.

577
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.189
They thought that Covid would be
over by now and they introduce

578
00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:11.397
something called thejob retention
bonus, £9 billion,

579
00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:14.564
which is going to be paid out
at the end of this year.

580
00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:17.439
They could have chosen to use that
money, instead of this game

581
00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:20.064
that they thought would be useful,
but put it back into

582
00:21:20.064 --> 00:21:21.147
the scheme today.

583
00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:23.689
They could have therefore
been far more generous,

584
00:21:23.689 --> 00:21:26.064
include the people I’m talking
about, who have been excluded,

585
00:21:26.064 --> 00:21:28.730
not got the help they need,
and it could have run

586
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.772
for a lot longer.

587
00:21:29.772 --> 00:21:32.147
That is what we have seen
in places like Germany,

588
00:21:32.147 --> 00:21:34.730
and France and Austria,
countries who are really getting

589
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.355
behind their businesses and helping
them through real distress and I’m

590
00:21:37.355 --> 00:21:40.480
afraid the government
really has failed.

591
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.897
Devi.

592
00:21:42.897 --> 00:21:46.272
Yeah, I do wonder if we are looking
at the problem the wrong way,

593
00:21:46.272 --> 00:21:49.189
because the idea has been that
you have your economic issues here,

594
00:21:49.189 --> 00:21:52.022
you have your public health problem
there and they are in opposition

595
00:21:52.022 --> 00:21:54.439
to each other, but if we look
at GDP performance,

596
00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:57.355
for the second quarter of 2020,
what you notice is the countries

597
00:21:57.355 --> 00:21:58.980
that control the virus
quite tightly, Taiwan,

598
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.980
South Korea, even you know,
Finland, Norway, there

599
00:22:08.689 --> 00:22:10.355
GDP has been minimal, less than 5%.

600
00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:12.730
Taiwan is practically the same
economically in the countries that

601
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.147
didn’t control the virus,
like the United States, the UK,

602
00:22:15.147 --> 00:22:17.814
Spain, are taking upwards of 20%,
as well as, you know,

603
00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:20.439
thousands of deaths, in the States,
hundreds of thousands of deaths.

604
00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.814
The question in my mind is,
we are entering this

605
00:22:22.814 --> 00:22:24.980
level of restrictions,
would it not be better instead

606
00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.397
to actually follow East Asia,
follow the model of strong

607
00:22:27.397 --> 00:22:29.814
suppression, possibly elimination,
and you get rid of your virus,

608
00:22:29.814 --> 00:22:32.897
you have a full domestic recovery,
and then you can get back to

609
00:22:32.897 --> 00:22:36.980
actually business recovering fully.

610
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.397
What I’m hearing from senior
economists, who I work with,

611
00:22:39.397 --> 00:22:41.814
that unless you solve your public
health problem, you’re not

612
00:22:41.814 --> 00:22:44.522
going to your economic problems
and we still have a substantial

613
00:22:44.522 --> 00:22:46.147
public health problem
and economic problem currently.

614
00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:47.564
I think that is exactly right.

615
00:22:47.564 --> 00:22:50.230
One of the real problems we have had
with this government

616
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.855
is that they have acted too slowly,
they have been inefficient,

617
00:22:52.855 --> 00:22:57.855
they have said they are going
to have an trace and isolation

618
00:22:57.855 --> 00:23:00.022
strategy, just the way that
other countries have had,

619
00:23:00.022 --> 00:23:02.397
working with local government,
they have just not done that.

620
00:23:02.397 --> 00:23:04.564
That has created the problems
for businesses and why

621
00:23:04.564 --> 00:23:06.480
we are in the mess that we are.

622
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.647
We have got Alok, forgive me,
we have got a question on that,

623
00:23:09.647 --> 00:23:11.772
so I am just going to move this on.

624
00:23:11.772 --> 00:23:12.814
Iqbal.

625
00:23:12.814 --> 00:23:13.814
What is your question?

626
00:23:13.814 --> 00:23:15.939
Hi there.

627
00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:18.855
Are the new measures a short step
away from full lockdown again,

628
00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.022
as this is what happened
the first time around,

629
00:23:21.022 --> 00:23:25.314
with more and more restrictions
happening almost every day?

630
00:23:25.314 --> 00:23:27.730
Peter, I am going to
come to you on that.

631
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.855
You were at the sharp
end in terms of

632
00:23:29.855 --> 00:23:33.022
the effect that restrictions would
have and if a full lockdown is just

633
00:23:33.022 --> 00:23:34.022
around the corner.

634
00:23:34.022 --> 00:23:36.647
Well, we were relieved
that this bizarre kind of

635
00:23:36.647 --> 00:23:39.605
circuit breaker idea
kind of went away.

636
00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:41.272
You thought it was bizarre?

637
00:23:41.272 --> 00:23:44.272
Yeah.

638
00:23:44.272 --> 00:23:46.897
I think, you know, the approach,
you have to deal with

639
00:23:46.897 --> 00:23:51.855
public health, there is no doubt
about that and, you know, no one

640
00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:57.105
should think the business would ever
put profits before people’s safety,

641
00:23:58.064 --> 00:24:00.689
because it is just not true.

642
00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:04.022
And certainly not in my industry.

643
00:24:04.022 --> 00:24:09.064
You know, we have
been quite frustrated

644
00:24:09.064 --> 00:24:11.689
that the government has felt
the need to impose traditional

645
00:24:11.689 --> 00:24:13.814
lockdowns and I would like to refer
back to

646
00:24:13.814 --> 00:24:16.939
the shenanigans last week
from Matt Hancock,...

647
00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:18.522
Shenanigans!

648
00:24:18.522 --> 00:24:21.647
Shenanigans.

649
00:24:21.647 --> 00:24:24.522
I mean, he came on to the radio four
today programme, it

650
00:24:24.522 --> 00:24:27.897
was about 815 last Friday and tried
to imply that the major cause for

651
00:24:27.897 --> 00:24:31.605
the increase in transmissions
was the hospitality industry.

652
00:24:31.605 --> 00:24:34.647
I mean, it is just totally untrue.

653
00:24:34.647 --> 00:24:37.189
Very, very misleading.

654
00:24:37.189 --> 00:24:40.814
You know, we opened onJuly
the 4th, you know, eight or

655
00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:43.980
nine weeks went by, there has been
no significant change in the number

656
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.355
of transmissions.

657
00:24:45.355 --> 00:24:50.314
Then, at the beginning
of September, there is a

658
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.855
big change, how on earth could that
be blamed on the hospitality

659
00:24:55.855 --> 00:24:56.897
industry?

660
00:24:56.897 --> 00:24:57.939
We are very angry.

661
00:24:57.939 --> 00:25:00.105
We want a retraction
and an apology and if

662
00:25:00.105 --> 00:25:02.564
we don’t get one, this
issue will not go away.

663
00:25:02.564 --> 00:25:04.189
People are really,
really hurt and upset.

664
00:25:04.189 --> 00:25:06.355
We sweated blood to get
ready to reopen our

665
00:25:06.355 --> 00:25:07.439
businesses.

666
00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:10.022
We worked really hard to make our
premises Covid secure from

667
00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:11.064
day one.

668
00:25:11.064 --> 00:25:14.189
Now, I have served one and a half
million people since we have

669
00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:15.647
opened, not one has got Covid.

670
00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:16.814
The government’s
figures, Public Health

671
00:25:16.814 --> 00:25:20.814
England figures, made it very clear
that week 37, which was the week

672
00:25:20.814 --> 00:25:25.772
before we spoke, number one, Arena
for transmissions, kept in their

673
00:25:29.064 --> 00:25:31.230
before we spoke, number one,
Arena for transmissions, care

674
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.147
homes, numbertwo, educational
settings, number three, workplaces.

675
00:25:33.147 --> 00:25:35.814
They said they don’t believe
it is happening in the workplace.

676
00:25:35.814 --> 00:25:39.897
It is in hospitality.

677
00:25:39.897 --> 00:25:42.605
And then they sent out
Dominic Raab the other day and

678
00:25:42.605 --> 00:25:46.189
when he was pressed he kind of said,
well we think it is kind of

679
00:25:46.189 --> 00:25:48.772
asymptomatic, so we think it is
actually happening, even though our

680
00:25:48.772 --> 00:25:50.272
own figures say it is not.

681
00:25:50.272 --> 00:25:52.439
I mean, poor Dominic,
it is not his fault,

682
00:25:52.439 --> 00:25:55.022
you know, they sent him
out to kind of face us.

683
00:25:55.022 --> 00:26:00.064
Just to be clear, so the Public
Health England figures, as

684
00:26:02.855 --> 00:26:05.939
you suggest, to the week of the 13th
of September, suggest a 508

685
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.689
confirmed outbreaks,
5% were in food outlets,

686
00:26:07.689 --> 00:26:08.730
including restaurants
and

687
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.730
pubs.

688
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.147
Can Ijust ask you, what do you make
of the ten o’clock curfew?

689
00:26:13.147 --> 00:26:14.147
Good idea, bad idea?

690
00:26:14.147 --> 00:26:17.022
I think it is a poor idea,
but not from a business

691
00:26:17.022 --> 00:26:18.064
perspective.

692
00:26:18.064 --> 00:26:19.147
I’m not too worried.

693
00:26:19.147 --> 00:26:22.230
In the sense of, my particular
business, it is not going to really

694
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.272
be impacted that much.

695
00:26:23.272 --> 00:26:24.730
It is just a bit absurd.

696
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.647
I have a vicar that comes
to one of our places for

697
00:26:27.647 --> 00:26:30.230
supper, Evensong, every week,
he sort of sits down about ten

698
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.939
to nine, he has something to eat.

699
00:26:31.939 --> 00:26:34.105
Now, as I understand it,
if the vicar hasn’t

700
00:26:34.105 --> 00:26:37.522
finished his chocolate souffle
at ten o’clock, I am going to have

701
00:26:37.522 --> 00:26:40.439
I am going to have to frogmarch him
out of the premises.

702
00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:42.355
I mean, it isjust
heavy—handed and silly.

703
00:26:42.355 --> 00:26:44.272
Hang on a minute, no
one is suggesting...

704
00:26:44.272 --> 00:26:46.689
In fairness, that you would have
to frogmarched him out.

705
00:26:46.689 --> 00:26:49.522
Just make it clear at ten o’clock
he would have to go.

706
00:26:49.522 --> 00:26:51.689
But really, now, the problem
here is if everyone

707
00:26:51.689 --> 00:26:53.772
walks out at ten o’clock,
that is quite dangerous.

708
00:26:53.772 --> 00:26:56.522
What you want is a kind of gradual
dispersal of people,

709
00:26:56.522 --> 00:26:59.355
so I would encourage the government
to look again at the detail.

710
00:26:59.355 --> 00:27:01.522
I don’t agree with the
curfew, but if there

711
00:27:01.522 --> 00:27:04.439
is going to be one, let’s do it
in a sensible fashion.

712
00:27:04.439 --> 00:27:06.605
We refer to Belgium,
that is the Antwerp model,

713
00:27:06.605 --> 00:27:10.397
that was an 1130 curfew and actually
at 1130 you had to stop serving

714
00:27:10.397 --> 00:27:12.730
drinks and you had time
to drink up and leave

715
00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.522
in a civilised fashion,
so

716
00:27:14.522 --> 00:27:16.980
it is a poor idea.

717
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.272
Yeah?

718
00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:21.064
And I think they need
to look at it again.

719
00:27:21.064 --> 00:27:24.439
Devi let us just come back
to the question specifically,

720
00:27:24.439 --> 00:27:26.814
are the new measures a short step
away from a

721
00:27:26.814 --> 00:27:28.730
full lockdown again,
with more and more restrictions

722
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.689
happening almost every few days,
because you are

723
00:27:30.689 --> 00:27:33.355
speaking to us from Edinburgh, and
you have different restrictions up

724
00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:37.980
there and I am thinking particularly
in terms of household mixing.

725
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.147
Yes, the idea was to
move early, to move

726
00:27:40.147 --> 00:27:43.730
aggressively and to get a check
on it and we are not even sure these

727
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.689
measures will be enough yet to
really take handle, especially as we

728
00:27:46.689 --> 00:27:48.355
have had universities
returning and a number

729
00:27:48.355 --> 00:27:49.397
of outbreaks in students.

730
00:27:49.397 --> 00:27:51.314
I guess the larger
point I would make

731
00:27:51.314 --> 00:27:54.647
is that we are not going back
to 2019, there is no normal anywhere

732
00:27:54.647 --> 00:27:55.730
across the world.

733
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.647
Every country is living
under different kinds of

734
00:27:57.647 --> 00:28:00.730
restrictions and in a way, we need
to move away from the lockdown

735
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.439
language and get into
degree of restrictions.

736
00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:03.980
Every country is making a choice.

737
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.397
If you look at East Asia
and the Pacific, those

738
00:28:06.397 --> 00:28:08.314
countries have said,
we want to get back

739
00:28:08.314 --> 00:28:09.564
to normal, live music,
full

740
00:28:09.564 --> 00:28:12.730
sports stadiums, you know, concerts,
all the things you can have, if you

741
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:17.730
eliminate the virus and you have
strong border checks.

742
00:28:24.022 --> 00:28:25.939
They accept the trade
off, they cannot travel

743
00:28:25.939 --> 00:28:26.980
abroad.

744
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.355
And you look at Europe and you’re
seen these night—time

745
00:28:29.355 --> 00:28:31.272
curfews, indoor hospitality shot,
basically going after riskier

746
00:28:31.272 --> 00:28:33.689
settings, assuming the virus
is circulating and you’re trying to

747
00:28:33.689 --> 00:28:34.730
stop super spreading events.

748
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.647
That means you cannot
have this kind of

749
00:28:36.647 --> 00:28:38.314
events, because too many
people become infected.

750
00:28:38.314 --> 00:28:40.730
I guess, we need to have
a functional testing, tracing

751
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.855
and isolating scheme and the latest
figures show it is truly a broken

752
00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.980
system currently, so
in a way, there is no

753
00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.230
other way to suppress
the

754
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.147
virus apart from keeping
people away from each

755
00:28:49.147 --> 00:28:50.314
other, and the longer
the

756
00:28:50.314 --> 00:28:53.480
government delays in trying to get
that system up and running, the more

757
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.647
likely we are to end up
in another lockdown.

758
00:28:55.647 --> 00:28:58.480
Because if you just let the virus
run its course, like what

759
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.397
has happened in Israel, the first
developed country to go back into

760
00:29:01.397 --> 00:29:03.980
national lockdown, the problem is
that your hospital start filling up,

761
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.397
the ICUs start filling up and at .6
case the talent he rate starts

762
00:29:07.397 --> 00:29:10.480
creeping up over one or 2%, people
arrive to hospital and cannot get

763
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.855
oxygen, cannot get treatment, cannot
get ventilators, and so governments

764
00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:15.980
are kind of forced into a national
lockdown to help the health care

765
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.397
capacity need and that means other
services like cancer treatments,

766
00:29:18.397 --> 00:29:20.314
surgeries, they get
backlogged, and we end up

767
00:29:20.314 --> 00:29:21.772
in a repeat of March
and

768
00:29:21.772 --> 00:29:25.397
that is what we are trying to avoid,
by keeping the virus at low levels,

769
00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:27.772
right now, before we get into that
really difficult position.

770
00:29:27.772 --> 00:29:29.480
0K, we have got some hands up.

771
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.522
Neil.

772
00:29:30.522 --> 00:29:31.522
Thanks.

773
00:29:31.522 --> 00:29:34.147
Just to go back to Ed’s point,
the benefit of hindsight

774
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:35.522
there.

775
00:29:35.522 --> 00:29:38.230
I think the government
are doing quite well.

776
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.480
I also do not share
the pessimistic views of

777
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.772
business at the moment.

778
00:29:41.772 --> 00:29:43.730
I mean, the construction
industry, we are

779
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.897
attempting to build our
way out of this crisis

780
00:29:45.897 --> 00:29:47.397
and I think doing very well.

781
00:29:47.397 --> 00:29:50.730
I have employed people recently,
the construction industry

782
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.980
is seeing growth,
there are sectors of it

783
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.105
that are closing down,
but

784
00:29:55.105 --> 00:29:57.064
there is also a lot
of sectors opening

785
00:29:57.064 --> 00:29:59.772
and also, Devi, Ithink
the

786
00:29:59.772 --> 00:30:02.689
ifs and buts in relation to your
last statement don’t quite follow

787
00:30:02.689 --> 00:30:03.855
through.

788
00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:06.772
We are not in the same
position that we were at the

789
00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:07.814
beginning of the year.

790
00:30:07.814 --> 00:30:09.272
People are wearing
masks, most business

791
00:30:09.272 --> 00:30:12.480
settings, mine in particular, are
Covid friendly or Covid safe and I

792
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.147
think lots of people are taking
the restrictions very seriously,

793
00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:18.855
so I don’t see us falling back
into the

794
00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:22.980
element of doom and gloom that seems
to be profiting through.

795
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.730
Alex.

796
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.897
With any new measures,
will the government be proactive

797
00:30:27.897 --> 00:30:30.189
or reactive in their response?

798
00:30:30.189 --> 00:30:32.105
You could argue previously,
like in March, the

799
00:30:32.105 --> 00:30:34.730
government was quite reactive,
they have been quite slow and their

800
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.022
response to Corona and I look,
as a student, as Devi was saying,

801
00:30:38.022 --> 00:30:41.564
students they can go to the pubs any
more, they are locked

802
00:30:41.564 --> 00:30:43.480
into their accommodation and I don’t
want that

803
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.647
to happen to me.

804
00:30:46.647 --> 00:30:49.022
I would rather the government
to be upfront and honest,

805
00:30:49.022 --> 00:30:52.147
say what could happen and put
the measures in place before it gets

806
00:30:52.147 --> 00:30:54.897
worse, not when it gets worse
or after it has happened.

807
00:30:54.897 --> 00:30:59.939
So, Alok, are unlikely
to see more restrictions?

808
00:31:03.772 --> 00:31:06.105
Well, nobody, Fiona,
wants to go into a full lockdown.

809
00:31:06.105 --> 00:31:08.647
That is absolutely clear.

810
00:31:08.647 --> 00:31:09.647
What we have done...

811
00:31:09.647 --> 00:31:11.772
Do you think it is
likely that more is

812
00:31:11.772 --> 00:31:12.855
coming down the line?

813
00:31:12.855 --> 00:31:15.272
Well, what we have always
said is that we will

814
00:31:15.272 --> 00:31:17.189
continue to monitor
this on a daily basis

815
00:31:17.189 --> 00:31:18.605
and obviously, if we need
to

816
00:31:18.605 --> 00:31:20.522
act, we will, but I
think the fundamental

817
00:31:20.522 --> 00:31:21.730
point here is that
the

818
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.355
vast majority of people have indeed
followed the rules and actually

819
00:31:24.355 --> 00:31:26.772
businesses have secured their
premises and I have worked with

820
00:31:26.772 --> 00:31:28.439
trade unions, I have
worked with businesses,

821
00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:31.105
to make sure that we have got
the right guidance out

822
00:31:31.105 --> 00:31:32.147
there.

823
00:31:32.147 --> 00:31:34.314
This is something the Prime
Minister, Matt Hancock, yourself,

824
00:31:34.314 --> 00:31:37.189
have said repeatedly over the last
few days and those people are

825
00:31:37.189 --> 00:31:39.814
following the rules and a recent
academic study found that between

826
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:43.522
May and August, only 18% of people
self isolated after developing

827
00:31:43.522 --> 00:31:45.730
symptoms and 11% were self
isolating after being

828
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.272
told they had been
in

829
00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:49.980
contact with a confirmed case.

830
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.147
Back in April,
it was 50%, it was not

831
00:31:52.147 --> 00:31:53.230
great then either.

832
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.647
What makes you so sure that
people are following the

833
00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:56.689
rules 7

834
00:31:56.689 --> 00:31:59.272
You talk about Test and Trace,
there are almost half a

835
00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.980
million people now who,
through that system,

836
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.064
have self isolated,
who

837
00:32:02.064 --> 00:32:05.147
would otherwise have been
putting others at risk.

838
00:32:05.147 --> 00:32:07.355
How can you be sure...

839
00:32:07.355 --> 00:32:10.439
I am just looking at those figures,
how can you be sure they

840
00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:13.147
are actually self isolating?

841
00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:15.064
Well, Ithink, you know,
they are obviously

842
00:32:15.064 --> 00:32:16.105
contacted...

843
00:32:16.105 --> 00:32:17.522
I know, that is very different.

844
00:32:17.522 --> 00:32:20.439
I understand that, but I think
there is a process to make

845
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:21.480
sure that that happens.

846
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.564
Are they being checked up on?

847
00:32:24.564 --> 00:32:26.939
Let me give you an example,
when you are talking

848
00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:30.314
about people not necessarily
following the rules, I mean I come

849
00:32:30.314 --> 00:32:33.439
into London every day by train
and I have actually seen now over

850
00:32:33.439 --> 00:32:35.605
the past few months people are,
by and large,

851
00:32:35.605 --> 00:32:38.689
just about everyone,
is observing the rule

852
00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:40.314
to have face coverings
on

853
00:32:40.314 --> 00:32:42.855
on public transport.

854
00:32:42.855 --> 00:32:45.314
Despite those figures,
are you confident that

855
00:32:45.314 --> 00:32:47.022
people who are being
told to self—isolate

856
00:32:47.022 --> 00:32:48.730
are self isolating,
in

857
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.189
large numbers?

858
00:32:51.189 --> 00:32:54.564
As I said to you, I think
if you look at Test and Trace,

859
00:32:54.564 --> 00:32:57.439
a significant percentage of people
who have been contacted as a result

860
00:32:57.439 --> 00:32:59.730
of somebody else getting
the infection are indeed self

861
00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:03.980
isolating, . . .

862
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.105
Where is the evidence of that?

863
00:33:07.105 --> 00:33:09.522
Louise is asking you
where the evidences?

864
00:33:09.522 --> 00:33:12.605
There is a fundamental
point here also about

865
00:33:12.605 --> 00:33:15.105
the position that we are in
and I think Neil made

866
00:33:15.105 --> 00:33:16.147
a really good point.

867
00:33:16.147 --> 00:33:19.980
We know a lot more about this virus,
we have got a whole set of measures

868
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.355
that are in place and nobody wants
to go into full lockdown, but what

869
00:33:23.355 --> 00:33:26.522
we need is people to continue to
observe the rules and the guidelines

870
00:33:26.522 --> 00:33:28.439
and I do think
the vast majority are.

871
00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.439
Louise.

872
00:33:29.439 --> 00:33:31.355
I mean the latest restrictions
and more advanced

873
00:33:31.355 --> 00:33:33.064
lockdown measures are
evidence of only one

874
00:33:33.064 --> 00:33:34.439
thing, that the virus
is

875
00:33:34.439 --> 00:33:36.397
going in the wrong
direction and this

876
00:33:36.397 --> 00:33:38.064
is a very grave moment
for the

877
00:33:38.064 --> 00:33:39.605
country.

878
00:33:39.605 --> 00:33:42.189
We have had 31,000 cases over
the last six days and

879
00:33:42.189 --> 00:33:44.064
hospitalisations and
the death toll rising

880
00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:45.980
again and I think peopla
are

881
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.772
right to ask whether we are back in
the same position as we were earlier

882
00:33:49.772 --> 00:33:52.439
this year, with the government
failing to prepare for a second

883
00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:56.230
lockdown.

884
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.314
The Track and Trace system is not
world heating, it is very far

885
00:33:59.314 --> 00:34:03.605
from it, less than 80% of contacts
are reliably not been reached every

886
00:34:03.605 --> 00:34:08.564
week.

887
00:34:08.605 --> 00:34:11.689
The new figures out today show that
10% of tests are being returned

888
00:34:11.689 --> 00:34:13.772
within 2A hours and
Track and Trace...

889
00:34:13.772 --> 00:34:15.480
That really is incorrect.

890
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.522
That is the ONS
statistics out today.

891
00:34:21.439 --> 00:34:24.064
From all testing roots, 10%,
10.6% have come back within 2A

892
00:34:24.064 --> 00:34:25.147
hours.

893
00:34:25.147 --> 00:34:27.522
The Track and Trace system has been
outsourced to companies

894
00:34:27.522 --> 00:34:29.897
like Serco, Deloitte, GAS,
none of which had any experience

895
00:34:29.897 --> 00:34:32.314
in track and tracing and that is why
so few

896
00:34:32.314 --> 00:34:34.939
are being reached and even fewer
are actually been followed up

897
00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.147
to make sure they self—isolate.

898
00:34:36.147 --> 00:34:38.564
And all of this means
that the backbone of the

899
00:34:38.564 --> 00:34:41.480
public health response is not there,
so we cannot ensure the wider

900
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.814
reopening of the economy
unless it is there as well.

901
00:34:43.814 --> 00:34:46.397
We have lost sight of the virus.

902
00:34:46.397 --> 00:34:49.230
And do you think, just coming back
to the question that we

903
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.647
are just a short step away
from a full lockdown?

904
00:34:51.647 --> 00:34:53.772
Well, until we have that
effective public health

905
00:34:53.772 --> 00:34:58.189
response underpinning any
restrictions, whether that is the

906
00:34:58.189 --> 00:35:00.855
Track and Trace system was
the consequence of testing, it was

907
00:35:00.855 --> 00:35:03.397
utterly inevitable that as schools,
universities and workers returned,

908
00:35:03.397 --> 00:35:06.105
that testing demand would increase,
but the government have not

909
00:35:06.105 --> 00:35:09.022
increased testing capacity
since the end ofJune.

910
00:35:09.022 --> 00:35:14.022
Mark, you have got your hand up.

911
00:35:14.314 --> 00:35:17.647
I just want to roll back to a point
that Peter made about the

912
00:35:17.647 --> 00:35:19.772
hospitality and entertainment
industry needing to open and then

913
00:35:19.772 --> 00:35:22.147
Devi made a point
about South East Asia,

914
00:35:22.147 --> 00:35:25.230
they made a trade off
and by

915
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.980
closing their borders and accepting
that they couldn’t travel, they were

916
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.564
able to open up hospitality
and entertainment.

917
00:35:30.564 --> 00:35:33.147
So, if we did that, how
would the holiday industry and

918
00:35:33.147 --> 00:35:34.189
the travel industry react?

919
00:35:34.189 --> 00:35:36.105
You’re not going to
please everyone all of

920
00:35:36.105 --> 00:35:40.897
the time, are you?

921
00:35:40.897 --> 00:35:42.855
Tia.

922
00:35:42.855 --> 00:35:45.605
So, I would just like
to go back to what was

923
00:35:45.605 --> 00:35:48.939
said about people being checked up
on when they come home and are asked

924
00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:50.772
to self—isolate or self—isolate
for other reasons.

925
00:35:50.772 --> 00:35:54.314
So, I got back from France quite
recently, had to fill

926
00:35:54.314 --> 00:35:57.689
in a passenger locator form and was
told I could be checked up on.

927
00:35:57.689 --> 00:35:59.480
I wasn’t, once.

928
00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.355
And I know a few other people
who have come back from

929
00:36:02.355 --> 00:36:07.397
France as well, or from other
holidays, who have not been checked

930
00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:12.897
up on and I was self—isolating
in London and I noticed when I came

931
00:36:13.689 --> 00:36:15.105
out of self—isolation that people in

932
00:36:15.105 --> 00:36:19.814
the shops weren’t particularly
wearing masks, even people working

933
00:36:19.814 --> 00:36:22.064
in the shops and the same
on public transport.

934
00:36:22.064 --> 00:36:24.689
Quite a lot of people were,
but also quite a few

935
00:36:24.689 --> 00:36:27.564
were not and I just feel
like if we do not put

936
00:36:27.564 --> 00:36:29.897
anyone in a position,
even just a shop door entrance,

937
00:36:29.897 --> 00:36:31.814
saying, would you mind
putting a mask on,

938
00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:32.855
something like that,
it

939
00:36:32.855 --> 00:36:35.022
does encourage people
to do so and if no

940
00:36:35.022 --> 00:36:36.772
one is checked up on,
it is

941
00:36:36.772 --> 00:36:40.147
all very nice that people have to
understand that they need to do it,

942
00:36:40.147 --> 00:36:43.189
but if no one feels like there
are going to be any repercussions,

943
00:36:43.189 --> 00:36:45.355
why would they, and I think
that is why

944
00:36:45.355 --> 00:36:47.272
there are so many
people not doing it.

945
00:36:47.272 --> 00:36:48.314
Let mejust...

946
00:36:48.314 --> 00:36:50.730
I am sorry, Tia,
I interrupted you, do go on.

947
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.189
I was just going to
say, I think it is

948
00:36:53.189 --> 00:36:56.730
difficult to expect people to do it
if they do not think that there are

949
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.814
going to be any repercussions
from it and, yeah, I think it needs

950
00:36:59.814 --> 00:37:03.439
a bit of encouragement
and it is really

951
00:37:03.439 --> 00:37:07.064
important and you are less likely to
do it if you feel like other people

952
00:37:07.064 --> 00:37:08.730
aren’t and therefore
you are not protected.

953
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.522
Let us just be really clear
and specific on this point

954
00:37:11.522 --> 00:37:14.689
that Tia raises, people who are told
to self—isolate, how do you know

955
00:37:14.689 --> 00:37:19.689
that they are doing it?

956
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.689
Well, there is a follow—up process

957
00:37:21.689 --> 00:37:24.064
that takes place, we have
people who are doing that.

958
00:37:24.064 --> 00:37:26.730
No, don’t move on to something else,
how many people are

959
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.730
followed up?

960
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.772
Tia wasn’t.

961
00:37:28.772 --> 00:37:32.397
As I said you, there
are half a million people

962
00:37:32.397 --> 00:37:34.730
who have been self—isolating
through the Test and Trace system.

963
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.897
And how do you know how many of them
actually are self isolating?

964
00:37:37.897 --> 00:37:38.939
Well, as I said...

965
00:37:38.939 --> 00:37:40.230
How many actually are?

966
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.397
There is a follow—up process
which obviously takes place.

967
00:37:42.397 --> 00:37:45.814
So, does the government
know how many are

968
00:37:45.814 --> 00:37:50.564
actually doing the self—isolating?

969
00:37:50.564 --> 00:37:54.730
Well, Fiona, half a million people,
almost half a million people now

970
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.105
through the test and trace system
have been self isolating.

971
00:37:57.105 --> 00:37:59.730
They have been asked to,
but how do you know they

972
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:00.855
actually are?

973
00:38:00.855 --> 00:38:03.730
I want to go back to this point
about test and tracing.

974
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.314
If I may, because Louise raised this
point about testing not

975
00:38:06.314 --> 00:38:08.022
increasing, actually capacity has
gone up significantly.

976
00:38:08.022 --> 00:38:09.897
We are almost at 260,000
testing capacity right

977
00:38:09.897 --> 00:38:14.897
now, so the idea...

978
00:38:16.355 --> 00:38:19.022
It was supposed to be
350,000 at the end ofJune.

979
00:38:19.022 --> 00:38:20.939
It has not increased
since the end of

980
00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:21.980
June.

981
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.397
The capacity has indeed gone
up and if you look...

982
00:38:24.397 --> 00:38:26.564
As we have talked up
many times in this

983
00:38:26.564 --> 00:38:28.939
programme, capacity is very
different to the number of people

984
00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:30.022
actually being tested.

985
00:38:30.022 --> 00:38:31.022
Ed.

986
00:38:31.022 --> 00:38:32.730
Fiona, I think people
will be extremely

987
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.855
worried at the moment,
they are worried that there

988
00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:37.272
could be a second lockdown,
they are worried that the

989
00:38:37.272 --> 00:38:39.689
government strategy on testing,
tracing and isolation just is not

990
00:38:39.689 --> 00:38:42.314
working and it is true, Alok,
we have seen the testing,

991
00:38:42.314 --> 00:38:44.480
how that has been sending people
to other parts

992
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.022
of the country, but on the isolation
point that you make, Fiona, that Tia

993
00:38:48.022 --> 00:38:50.230
made, people are not
being checked up on and

994
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.397
the report that you quoted,

995
00:38:51.397 --> 00:38:53.772
you have got to ask why
people are not isolating

996
00:38:53.772 --> 00:38:55.230
when they have been asked to.

997
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.105
First of all, they are not
being checked up on, secondly people

998
00:38:58.105 --> 00:39:01.230
who are desperate to go to work,
they are not giving any support

999
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.480
payments to stay at home.

1000
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480
In Germany, they are.

1001
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.522
They are encouraged,
their financial losses

1002
00:39:05.522 --> 00:39:08.814
being recompensed.

1003
00:39:08.814 --> 00:39:11.897
Let me finish.

1004
00:39:11.897 --> 00:39:14.064
You have got no real
strategy on that, nothing

1005
00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:15.314
like the Germans have got.

1006
00:39:15.314 --> 00:39:17.897
The Germans have been far more
successful and there is another

1007
00:39:17.897 --> 00:39:20.189
issue that we have got
to remember, I think

1008
00:39:20.189 --> 00:39:22.397
the public lost a lot
of

1009
00:39:22.397 --> 00:39:24.814
trust in the government
earlier in this pandemic,

1010
00:39:24.814 --> 00:39:27.439
when Dominic Cummings broke
the lockdown rules and paid no

1011
00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:32.480
price for that.

1012
00:39:32.814 --> 00:39:35.480
That sent a really bad message
and if you are surprised

1013
00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.105
that people out there aren’t
following all the rules, Alok, I

1014
00:39:38.105 --> 00:39:40.730
think you need to talk
to your Prime Minister and say,

1015
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.689
why did he not pull
up Dominic Cummings?

1016
00:39:42.689 --> 00:39:44.814
There can’t be one
rule for us and one

1017
00:39:44.814 --> 00:39:46.022
rule for Boris Johnson’s friends.

1018
00:39:46.022 --> 00:39:48.439
Sherry, you have had your
hand up a long time.

1019
00:39:48.439 --> 00:39:52.814
Just with regards to the increasing
restrictions, it seems to

1020
00:39:52.814 --> 00:39:55.397
be every few days, more
and more restrictions

1021
00:39:55.397 --> 00:40:00.397
that are coming in,
I

1022
00:40:02.897 --> 00:40:05.314
think a lot of confidence
in the government’s long term

1023
00:40:05.314 --> 00:40:06.980
strategy has been lost,
because red lines

1024
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.189
have not been laid out.

1025
00:40:08.189 --> 00:40:13.189
Everybody senses we are
going in the direction

1026
00:40:13.772 --> 00:40:15.897
of a second lockdown,
but with the recent push

1027
00:40:15.897 --> 00:40:17.105
towards moving peopla
to

1028
00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:19.522
go back to the office
to work, which has now

1029
00:40:19.522 --> 00:40:20.564
been reversed, people
are

1030
00:40:20.564 --> 00:40:23.564
now being encouraged to work
from home, there is very little

1031
00:40:23.564 --> 00:40:26.814
confidence that despite the
government saying we will endeavour

1032
00:40:26.814 --> 00:40:29.897
to keep schools open,
that is our priority, I,

1033
00:40:29.897 --> 00:40:33.897
as a parent of a school age child,
have no confidence that

1034
00:40:33.897 --> 00:40:38.814
that is going to pan out.

1035
00:40:38.814 --> 00:40:43.397
How can we see an
evidence—based approach on

1036
00:40:43.397 --> 00:40:44.439
the government’s policies?

1037
00:40:44.439 --> 00:40:46.147
In terms of restrictions,
moving on and

1038
00:40:46.147 --> 00:40:48.272
developing every few
days, as you mention,

1039
00:40:48.272 --> 00:40:49.689
let us take a question
on

1040
00:40:49.689 --> 00:40:54.689
exactly that from Linda.

1041
00:40:58.689 --> 00:40:59.730
Hi, good evening.

1042
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:00.855
My question is regarding Christmas.

1043
00:41:00.855 --> 00:41:02.564
Christmas seems to be
cancelled, doesn’t it,

1044
00:41:02.564 --> 00:41:04.939
Linda, were not quite sure
what is happening with Christmas.

1045
00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:06.022
Go on.

1046
00:41:06.022 --> 00:41:09.105
Well, Christmas lunch in a pub,
on tables of six, in separate names,

1047
00:41:09.105 --> 00:41:11.730
in order to be able to see my
children and grandchildren

1048
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:12.980
altogether.

1049
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.647
That is probably, hopefully,
the next time we can all be

1050
00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:20.230
together, as a family.

1051
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.314
Is Christmas off!

1052
00:41:21.314 --> 00:41:22.355
Ed?

1053
00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:23.980
Well, I really hope it isn’t.

1054
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.064
It is so important for families
to come together, but we are only

1055
00:41:27.064 --> 00:41:28.980
going to save Christmas
if the government get

1056
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.022
their act together.

1057
00:41:30.022 --> 00:41:32.480
We have been asking,
the Labour Party have been asking,

1058
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.855
the opposition parties have been
asking them, to sort out

1059
00:41:34.855 --> 00:41:35.855
test trace and isolate.

1060
00:41:35.855 --> 00:41:39.522
I am sorry to come back to that,
but it has failed for many reasons.

1061
00:41:39.522 --> 00:41:42.355
Let me give you another reason,
in many other countries like Korea,

1062
00:41:42.355 --> 00:41:44.730
like Taiwan, like Germany,
the government has trusted the local

1063
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.105
authority, the councils,
the local public health officials

1064
00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:49.980
and worked with them,
they have been part of a team.

1065
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.230
In this government, it has been
all centralised, Whitehall run.

1066
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.480
Sometimes local councils haven’t
been given any information

1067
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.689
until the last minute,
that is just not acceptable

1068
00:41:58.689 --> 00:42:01.730
and if you talk to officials
and public health, they are pretty

1069
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.064
cross, because this was a basic
tenet of public health

1070
00:42:04.064 --> 00:42:08.730
policy in a pandemic,
that you should have a team

1071
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.105
approach, a locally—based approach,
and if you did contact tracing

1072
00:42:11.105 --> 00:42:14.022
locally, properly, rather
than through a central core system

1073
00:42:14.022 --> 00:42:17.730
with all your private contractors
who are getting all these

1074
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.314
nice juicy contracts,
I tell you what, it would workjust

1075
00:42:20.314 --> 00:42:25.355
like it is working well
in other countries.

1076
00:42:30.022 --> 00:42:31.814
This is the rule of six and you are

1077
00:42:31.814 --> 00:42:32.897
This is the mic of six and you are
doing things a

1078
00:42:32.897 --> 00:42:33.564
This is the rule of six and you are
doing things a bit differently in

1079
00:42:33.564 --> 00:42:35.897
doing things a bit differently in
Scotland, it’s the rule of six by

1080
00:42:35.897 --> 00:42:36.772
Scotland, it’s the rule of six by
different households cannot meet,

1081
00:42:36.772 --> 00:42:37.064
different households rannot meet,
which

1082
00:42:37.064 --> 00:42:37.897
different households cannot meet,
which would create problems for

1083
00:42:37.897 --> 00:42:38.272
which would create problams for
Linda if

1084
00:42:38.272 --> 00:42:39.272
which would create problems for
Linda if that comes to England. What

1085
00:42:39.272 --> 00:42:40.689
Linda if that comes to England. what
is it that you

1086
00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:41.730
Linda if that comes to England. What
is it that you know or you think you

1087
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:44.230
is it that you know or you think you
know in Scotland that means that

1088
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.064
know in Scotland that means that
different households shouldn’t meet,

1089
00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.814
different households shouldn’t meet,
which isn’t known or is being done

1090
00:42:47.814 --> 00:42:52.855
which isn’t known or is being done
differently in England? I think the

1091
00:42:52.855 --> 00:42:53.897
differently in England? I think the
scientific advice is pretty similar

1092
00:42:53.897 --> 00:42:54.855
scientific advice is pretty similar
across the nations and many

1093
00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:57.814
across the nations and many
countries across the world, and

1094
00:42:57.814 --> 00:42:59.230
countries across the world, and
these are political decisions and

1095
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.647
these are political decisions and
trade—offs of what you are going to

1096
00:43:00.647 --> 00:43:00.814
trade-offs of what you are going to
emphasise

1097
00:43:00.814 --> 00:43:01.855
trade—offs of what you are going to
emphasise and how you manage the

1098
00:43:01.855 --> 00:43:05.355
emphasise and how you manage the
infection. why

1099
00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:06.230
emphasise and how you manage the
infection. Why do you think Scotland

1100
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.397
infection. why do you think Scotland
has

1101
00:43:06.397 --> 00:43:10.147
infection. Why do you think Scotland
has taken that approach? The tracing

1102
00:43:10.147 --> 00:43:11.897
has taken that approach? The tracing
system is quite robust here and they

1103
00:43:11.897 --> 00:43:13.355
system is quite robust here and they
found that many of the clusters were

1104
00:43:13.355 --> 00:43:15.355
found that many of the clusters were
coming from households, indoor

1105
00:43:15.355 --> 00:43:19.105
coming from households, indoor
homes, house parties has been a big

1106
00:43:19.105 --> 00:43:20.564
homes, house parties has been a big
problem, so we are trying to break

1107
00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:24.355
problem, so we are trying to break
those chains of transmission. These

1108
00:43:24.355 --> 00:43:25.647
those chains of transmission. These
kind of restrictions were put into

1109
00:43:25.647 --> 00:43:26.647
kind of restrictions were put into
the west of Scotland 3

1110
00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:27.772
kind of restrictions were put into
the west of Scotland a few weeks

1111
00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:30.814
the west of Scotland a few weeks
back and they managed to change the

1112
00:43:30.814 --> 00:43:31.022
hack and they managed to change the
exponential

1113
00:43:31.022 --> 00:43:32.480
back and they managed to change the
exponential into linear growth, so

1114
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.814
exponential into linear growth, so
getting a handle on that, and

1115
00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:34.189
getting a handla on that, and
hopefully

1116
00:43:34.189 --> 00:43:35.439
getting a handle on that, and
hopefully that can do the same for

1117
00:43:35.439 --> 00:43:35.772
hopefully that ran do the same for
the rest

1118
00:43:35.772 --> 00:43:40.814
hopefully that can do the same for
the rest of the country. I think the

1119
00:43:40.814 --> 00:43:43.897
the rest of the country. I think the
thing that brings all of these

1120
00:43:43.897 --> 00:43:45.647
thing that brings all of these
together is the test, track and

1121
00:43:45.647 --> 00:43:47.230
together is the test, track and
trace. The thing which has been most

1122
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.647
trace. The thing which has been most
seen in the news over the last

1123
00:43:48.647 --> 00:43:50.439
seen in the news over the last
couple of weeks has been how much of

1124
00:43:50.439 --> 00:43:54.480
couple of weeks has been how much of
a shambles the testing system is in.

1125
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.064
a shambles the testing system is in.
People can’t get a test and, when

1126
00:43:56.064 --> 00:43:58.772
People can’t get a test and, when
you can’t get a test, you can’t tell

1127
00:43:58.772 --> 00:44:00.189
you can’t get a test, you can’t tell
how many people in the country are

1128
00:44:00.189 --> 00:44:00.355
how many peopla in the country are
getting

1129
00:44:00.355 --> 00:44:03.814
how many people in the country are
getting the virus. When we can’t

1130
00:44:03.814 --> 00:44:04.439
getting the vims. when we can’t
tell who

1131
00:44:04.439 --> 00:44:05.189
getting the virus. When we can’t
tell who those people are, they

1132
00:44:05.189 --> 00:44:05.439
tell who those peopla are, they
can’t

1133
00:44:05.439 --> 00:44:07.397
tell who those people are, they
can’t tell them to isolate. You then

1134
00:44:07.397 --> 00:44:12.647
can’t tell them to isolate. You then
can’t track their known contacts,

1135
00:44:12.647 --> 00:44:13.022
ran’t track their known contacts,
and the

1136
00:44:13.022 --> 00:44:14.189
can’t track their known contacts,
and the virus is then out of control

1137
00:44:14.189 --> 00:44:15.855
and the virus is then out of control
again. So

1138
00:44:15.855 --> 00:44:16.272
and the virus is then out of control
again. Sol

1139
00:44:16.272 --> 00:44:17.314
and the virus is then out of control
again. So I think we need to start

1140
00:44:17.314 --> 00:44:18.855
again. So I think we need to start
to fix the testing system so that we

1141
00:44:18.855 --> 00:44:20.772
to fix the testing system so that we
ran track

1142
00:44:20.772 --> 00:44:21.439
to fix the testing system so that we
can track thereafter and trace

1143
00:44:21.439 --> 00:44:25.022
can track thereafter and trace
thereafter. It’s really important.

1144
00:44:25.022 --> 00:44:26.480
thereafter. It’s really important.
If we don’t fix the testing system

1145
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.314
If we don’t fix the testing system
at the moment, then I fear that we

1146
00:44:29.314 --> 00:44:32.730
at the moment, then I fear that we
are going to face a second lockdown

1147
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.022
are going to face a second lockdown
and Christmas is going to be

1148
00:44:34.022 --> 00:44:36.480
and Christmas is going to be
cancelled, and I really hope that

1149
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.647
cancelled, and I really hope that
both of those things aren’t true,

1150
00:44:37.647 --> 00:44:41.064
both of those things aren’t true,
but my fear is they are. Peter, you

1151
00:44:41.064 --> 00:44:45.730
but my fear is they are. Peter, you
didn’t wait for the England and

1152
00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:46.064
didn’t wait for the England and
Walas app,

1153
00:44:46.064 --> 00:44:47.439
didn’t wait for the England and
Wales app, which was launched today,

1154
00:44:47.439 --> 00:44:48.064
Walas app, which was hunched today,
and it was

1155
00:44:48.064 --> 00:44:48.855
Wales app, which was launched today,
and it was much earlier in Northern

1156
00:44:48.855 --> 00:44:49.064
and it was much eartier in Northern
Ireland

1157
00:44:49.064 --> 00:44:50.480
and it was much earlier in Northern
Ireland and Scotland. You go ahead

1158
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.564
Ireland and Scotland. You go ahead
and did your own app. We did that

1159
00:44:54.564 --> 00:44:56.730
and did your own app. We did that
because we wanted to be Covid safe

1160
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.647
because we wanted to be Covid safe
and enable people to order food and

1161
00:44:58.647 --> 00:44:59.064
and enabla peopla to order food and
drink on

1162
00:44:59.064 --> 00:44:59.230
and enable people to order food and
drink on our

1163
00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.022
and enable people to order food and
drink on ourapp.

1164
00:45:00.022 --> 00:45:00.480
and enable people to order food and
drink on our app. We quickly

1165
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.439
drink on our app. We quickly
realised that was the way to solve

1166
00:45:03.439 --> 00:45:06.730
realised that was the way to solve
the contact tracing. So we were able

1167
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.480
the contact tracing. So we were able
to do it so every time a customer

1168
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.230
to do it so every time a customer
comes in, once they have registered

1169
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.605
comes in, once they have registered
on our app, we know they are there,

1170
00:45:13.605 --> 00:45:15.189
on our app, we know they are there,
so that, if we were to be contacted

1171
00:45:15.189 --> 00:45:18.522
so that, if we were to be contacted
by the government and say, look, so

1172
00:45:18.522 --> 00:45:20.980
by the government and say, look, so
was in your pub, we could work out

1173
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.605
was in your pub, we could work out
who they might have had any form of

1174
00:45:22.605 --> 00:45:27.022
who they might have had any form of
contact with. Did you just give up

1175
00:45:27.022 --> 00:45:29.855
contact with. Did you just give up
on the government, in terms of the

1176
00:45:29.855 --> 00:45:31.689
on the government, in terms of the
tracing app? It was a bit confusing,

1177
00:45:31.689 --> 00:45:35.730
tracing app? It was a bit confusing,
and I think it was in May, it was

1178
00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.480
and I think it was in May, it was
confirmed it was coming out the

1179
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.522
confirmed it was coming out the
following week, and we are for micro

1180
00:45:39.522 --> 00:45:41.314
following week, and we are for micro
months on! Hell of a big gap, we had

1181
00:45:41.314 --> 00:45:46.522
months on! Hell of a big gap, we had
a responsibility to report our

1182
00:45:46.522 --> 00:45:47.730
a responsibility to report our
customers, and it was the easiest

1183
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:47.855
customers, and it was the easiest
“Y

1184
00:45:47.855 --> 00:45:50.480
customers, and it was the easiest
way of doing it. People who didn’t

1185
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.730
way of doing it. People who didn’t
have telephones, we took it manually

1186
00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:57.355
have telephones, we took it manually
on a pad, so we have always

1187
00:45:57.355 --> 00:45:58.564
on a pad, so we have always
compliant Day complied. We help the

1188
00:45:58.564 --> 00:46:03.105
compliant Day complied. We help the
government before the regulations. I

1189
00:46:03.105 --> 00:46:04.480
government before the regulations. I
do think people should support the

1190
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.689
do think people should support the
government with these rules in every

1191
00:46:05.689 --> 00:46:05.855
government with these mles in every
“Y

1192
00:46:05.855 --> 00:46:08.105
government with these mles in every
way they ran.

1193
00:46:08.105 --> 00:46:09.689
government with these rules in every
way they can. Are you worried about

1194
00:46:09.689 --> 00:46:10.022
way they ran. Are you worried about
the effect

1195
00:46:10.022 --> 00:46:11.064
way they can. Are you worried about
the effect on Christmas, in terms of

1196
00:46:11.064 --> 00:46:14.105
the effect on Christmas, in terms of
bookings? Well, yes, but

1197
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:14.355
the effect on Christmas, in terms of
bookings? Well, yes, butl

1198
00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:14.480
the effect on Christmas, in terms of
bookings? Well, yes, but I think

1199
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.272
bookings? Well, yes, but I think
there is a wider tragedy. Everybody

1200
00:46:17.272 --> 00:46:21.105
there is a wider tragedy. Everybody
uses the emotive term of Christmas

1201
00:46:21.105 --> 00:46:22.272
uses the emotive term of Christmas
being cancelled, and clearly it

1202
00:46:22.272 --> 00:46:22.814
being cancelled, and dearty it
isn’t, it’s just

1203
00:46:22.814 --> 00:46:23.064
being cancelled, and clearly it
isn’t, it’sjust going

1204
00:46:23.064 --> 00:46:23.189
being cancelled, and clearly it
isn’t, it’s just going to

1205
00:46:23.189 --> 00:46:23.480
being cancelled, and clearly it
isn’t, it’sjust going to be

1206
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.147
isn’t, it’sjust going to be
different. I don’t think it will be

1207
00:46:26.147 --> 00:46:26.647
different. I don’t think it will be
possibla for

1208
00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:28.064
different. I don’t think it will be
possible for the government to allow

1209
00:46:28.064 --> 00:46:29.730
possible for the government to allow
large office parties and stuff, so

1210
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.105
large office parties and stuff, so
we’ll just

1211
00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:30.272
large office parties and stuff, so
we’lljust have

1212
00:46:30.272 --> 00:46:30.480
large office parties and stuff, so
we’ll just have to

1213
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.605
large office parties and stuff, so
we’lljust have to suck that up. But

1214
00:46:32.605 --> 00:46:33.230
we’ll just have to suck that up. But
I think it

1215
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.814
we’lljust have to suck that up. But
I think it would be a

1216
00:46:33.814 --> 00:46:34.064
we’lljust have to suck that up. But
I think it would be areal

1217
00:46:34.064 --> 00:46:35.147
we’lljust have to suck that up. But
I think it would be a real shame if

1218
00:46:35.147 --> 00:46:36.397
I think it would be a real shame if
families can’t get together at

1219
00:46:36.397 --> 00:46:38.022
families can’t get together at
Christmas time, so let’s hope that

1220
00:46:38.022 --> 00:46:41.814
Christmas time, so let’s hope that
the measures being put in place will

1221
00:46:41.814 --> 00:46:43.439
the measures being put in place will
work, and perhaps some more detailed

1222
00:46:43.439 --> 00:46:46.730
work, and perhaps some more detailad
[oral action,

1223
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.855
work, and perhaps some more detailed
localaction, because

1224
00:46:46.855 --> 00:46:47.939
work, and perhaps some more detailed
local action, because I think what

1225
00:46:47.939 --> 00:46:48.355
[oral action, because I think what
is needed,

1226
00:46:48.355 --> 00:46:48.939
local action, because I think what
is needed, rather than this

1227
00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:51.189
is needed, rather than this
centralised command and control,

1228
00:46:51.189 --> 00:46:53.064
centralised command and control,
same for all four parts of the

1229
00:46:53.064 --> 00:46:56.730
same for all four parts of the
country, just to look at the detail.

1230
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.897
country, just to look at the detail.
If you compare the Treasury, with

1231
00:46:57.897 --> 00:46:59.189
If you compare the Treasury, with
this great execution of everything

1232
00:46:59.189 --> 00:47:00.814
this great execution of everything
that they do, and on the health side

1233
00:47:00.814 --> 00:47:03.230
that they do, and on the health side
not so good they are failing to

1234
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.855
not so good they are failing to
execute, they need to get on top of

1235
00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:10.605
execute, they need to get on top of
it. Louise. Linda, you have a much

1236
00:47:10.605 --> 00:47:11.022
it. Louise. Linda, you have a much
bigger family

1237
00:47:11.022 --> 00:47:12.022
it. Louise. Linda, you have a much
biggerfamily than mine, and I think

1238
00:47:12.022 --> 00:47:13.189
bigger family than mine, and I think
I could fit my

1239
00:47:13.189 --> 00:47:14.022
biggerfamily than mine, and I think
I could fit my whole family and my

1240
00:47:14.022 --> 00:47:14.397
I could fit my whola family and my
mates on

1241
00:47:14.397 --> 00:47:19.980
I could fit my whole family and my
mates on one table of six!

1242
00:47:21.689 --> 00:47:23.314
mates on one table of six! Really!
Not so much the family but the

1243
00:47:23.314 --> 00:47:27.439
Not so much the family but the
mates! I don’t want to sound like a

1244
00:47:27.439 --> 00:47:29.272
mates! I don’t want to sound like a
broken record, but it really is

1245
00:47:29.272 --> 00:47:30.272
broken record, but it really is
getting test, trace and isolate

1246
00:47:30.272 --> 00:47:32.189
getting test, trace and isolate
fixed. This isn’t with the benefit

1247
00:47:32.189 --> 00:47:35.230
fixed. This isn’t with the benefit
of hindsight. The World Health

1248
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.439
of hindsight. The World Health
Organisation was clear back in

1249
00:47:36.439 --> 00:47:38.272
Organisation was clear back in
March, as we were watching the virus

1250
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:41.689
March, as we were watching the virus
come from China to Italy and this

1251
00:47:41.689 --> 00:47:42.689
come from China to Italy and this
country, that that system was

1252
00:47:42.689 --> 00:47:44.689
country, that that system was
necessary as a backbone in our

1253
00:47:44.689 --> 00:47:44.814
necessary as a backbone in our
pub“:

1254
00:47:44.814 --> 00:47:45.689
necessary as a backbone in our
public health response, and the

1255
00:47:45.689 --> 00:47:47.814
public health response, and the
government stopped tracking and

1256
00:47:47.814 --> 00:47:49.230
government stopped tracking and
tracing back in April. It didn’t run

1257
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.564
tracing back in April. It didn’t mn
proper testing,

1258
00:47:51.564 --> 00:47:51.814
tracing back in April. It didn’t run
propertesting, didn’t

1259
00:47:51.814 --> 00:47:52.230
tracing back in April. It didn’t run
proper testing, didn’t ramp up

1260
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:53.397
proper testing, didn’t ramp up
testing capacity to where it needs

1261
00:47:53.397 --> 00:47:55.647
testing capacity to where it needs
to be. I think the public are

1262
00:47:55.647 --> 00:47:57.689
to be. I think the public are
incredibly sympathetic and I

1263
00:47:57.689 --> 00:47:59.189
incredibly sympathetic and I
understand this is very difficult

1264
00:47:59.189 --> 00:48:01.439
understand this is very difficult
but, actually, it is pretty simple

1265
00:48:01.439 --> 00:48:03.439
but, actually, it is pretty simple
to is needed to be done, and it’s

1266
00:48:03.439 --> 00:48:04.439
to is needed to be done, and it’s
unforgivable that the government is

1267
00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:08.189
unforgivable that the government is
where it is. The virus is an act of

1268
00:48:08.189 --> 00:48:09.189
where it is. The virus is an act of
God, but the incompetence and

1269
00:48:09.189 --> 00:48:11.022
God, but the incompetence and
failure to address it, they lie

1270
00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:13.522
failure to address it, they lie
squarely with the government. Can

squarely with the government. (“an

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.355
january for a holiday and, since
returning, I

1289
00:48:48.355 --> 00:48:52.439
January for a holiday and, since
returning, I have been following my

1290
00:48:52.439 --> 00:48:53.647
returning, I have been following my
lockdown here through Zoom and the

1291
00:48:53.647 --> 00:48:54.855
lockdown here through Zoom and the
telephone, and I have been observing

1292
00:48:54.855 --> 00:48:57.022
telephone, and I have been observing
bears, and they went through a

1293
00:48:57.022 --> 00:48:59.980
bears, and they went through a
harder lockdown, and now they are

1294
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.980
harder lockdown, and now they are
mainly recovered and getting about

1295
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.605
mainly recovered and getting about
their own lives. A good question

1296
00:49:06.605 --> 00:49:08.605
their own lives. A good question
about hospitality, because there are

1297
00:49:08.605 --> 00:49:09.689
about hospitality, because there are
restrictions about people travelling

1298
00:49:09.689 --> 00:49:09.855
restrictions about peopla travelling
abroad,

1299
00:49:09.855 --> 00:49:10.980
restrictions about people travelling
abroad, and lots of hotels are now

1300
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.397
abroad, and lots of hotels are now
fully booked from local people

1301
00:49:13.397 --> 00:49:13.605
fully booked from [oral peopla
travelling,

1302
00:49:13.605 --> 00:49:14.605
fully booked from local people
travelling, trying to make the most

1303
00:49:14.605 --> 00:49:18.772
travelling, trying to make the most
in the country itself, so I fully

1304
00:49:18.772 --> 00:49:20.439
in the country itself, so I fully
echo what Devi is saying, that there

1305
00:49:20.439 --> 00:49:22.064
echo what Devi is saying, that there
is no conflict in balancing public

1306
00:49:22.064 --> 00:49:22.314
is no conﬂict in balancing public
health

1307
00:49:22.314 --> 00:49:27.689
is no conflict in balancing public
health and the economy. Elliott. It

1308
00:49:27.689 --> 00:49:29.272
health and the economy. Elliott. It
was just to add to some of the

1309
00:49:29.272 --> 00:49:31.189
was just to add to some of the
points that Kieran made about the

1310
00:49:31.189 --> 00:49:34.230
points that Kieran made about the
failures of testing. I think a large

1311
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.689
failures of testing. I think a large
part of the failure is with the

1312
00:49:35.689 --> 00:49:38.230
part of the failure is with the
privatisation of testing. We talk

1313
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.355
privatisation of testing. We talk
about NHS testing but, in many

1314
00:49:40.355 --> 00:49:40.522
about NHS testing but, in many
uses,

1315
00:49:40.522 --> 00:49:42.647
about NHS testing but, in many
cases, it isn’t the NHS who are

1316
00:49:42.647 --> 00:49:43.022
rases, it isn’t the NHS who are
testing. A

1317
00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:45.564
cases, it isn’t the NHS who are
testing. A family friend had to pay

1318
00:49:45.564 --> 00:49:47.689
testing. A family friend had to pay
£175 to get a test and they did have

1319
00:49:47.689 --> 00:49:49.897
£175 to get a test and they did have
coronavirus. If they were not in a

1320
00:49:49.897 --> 00:49:51.272
coronavirus. If they were not in a
position to pay, that would have

1321
00:49:51.272 --> 00:49:52.439
position to pay, that would have
been somebody who would not have

1322
00:49:52.439 --> 00:49:54.272
been somebody who would not have
been able to get access to a test

1323
00:49:54.272 --> 00:49:57.272
been able to get access to a test
otherwise it would have been going

1324
00:49:57.272 --> 00:49:58.439
otherwise it would have been going
out in society unaware they had

1325
00:49:58.439 --> 00:49:58.814
out in society unaware they had
coronavirus. So

1326
00:49:58.814 --> 00:49:59.022
out in society unaware they had
coronavirus. Sojust

1327
00:49:59.022 --> 00:49:59.772
out in society unaware they had
coronavirus. So just adding to that

1328
00:49:59.772 --> 00:50:01.189
coronavirus. So just adding to that
and mentioning the impact of

1329
00:50:01.189 --> 00:50:05.022
and mentioning the impact of
privatisation on testing as well. No

1330
00:50:05.022 --> 00:50:08.522
privatisation on testing as well. No
government wants to be cast in the

1331
00:50:08.522 --> 00:50:08.855
government wants to be fast in the
role of

1332
00:50:08.855 --> 00:50:09.730
government wants to be cast in the
role of the Grinch, obviously, and

1333
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.105
rola of the Grinch, obviously, and
Boris johnson

1334
00:50:10.105 --> 00:50:12.230
role of the Grinch, obviously, and
BorisJohnson said he very much

1335
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.605
Boris johnson said he very much
hopes things

1336
00:50:12.605 --> 00:50:13.647
BorisJohnson said he very much
hopes things could get, that we can

1337
00:50:13.647 --> 00:50:13.980
hopes things could get, that we ran
get together

1338
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.772
hopes things could get, that we can
get together at Christmas, but he

1339
00:50:14.772 --> 00:50:17.730
get together at Christmas, but he
can’t promise. When you listen to

1340
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.022
can’t promise. when you listen to
Linda, who

1341
00:50:20.022 --> 00:50:21.064
can’t promise. When you listen to
Linda, who obviously has a massive

1342
00:50:21.064 --> 00:50:22.314
Linda, who obviously has a massive
family, congratulations, but the

1343
00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:23.564
family, congratulations, but the
idea of getting altogether at the

1344
00:50:23.564 --> 00:50:24.772
idea of getting altogether at the
moment, if the will of six

1345
00:50:24.772 --> 00:50:27.605
moment, if the will of six
continues, is a nonstarter. I

1346
00:50:27.605 --> 00:50:27.772
moment, if the will of six
continues, is a nonstarter. Iwould

1347
00:50:27.772 --> 00:50:28.730
continues, is a nonstarter. Iwould
like [cad

1348
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:30.105
continues, is a nonstarter. Iwould
like lead and all of us to enjoy

1349
00:50:30.105 --> 00:50:30.772
like lead and all of us to enjoy
time with our

1350
00:50:30.772 --> 00:50:30.939
like lead and all of us to enjoy
time with ourfamilies

1351
00:50:30.939 --> 00:50:31.397
like lead and all of us to enjoy
time with our families at Christmas,

1352
00:50:31.397 --> 00:50:33.064
time with our families at Christmas,
but let’s go back to where we are

1353
00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:35.230
but let’s go back to where we are
now compared to March. We are in a

1354
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:36.855
now compared to March. We are in a
quite different place because of the

1355
00:50:36.855 --> 00:50:38.772
quite different place because of the
action is the government has taken,

1356
00:50:38.772 --> 00:50:40.397
action is the government has taken,
and because lots of people have

1357
00:50:40.397 --> 00:50:40.605
and because lots of peopla have
shown

1358
00:50:40.605 --> 00:50:41.814
and because lots of people have
shown an enormous amount of common

1359
00:50:41.814 --> 00:50:43.355
shown an enormous amount of common
sense. We have managed the months to

1360
00:50:43.355 --> 00:50:45.772
sense. We have managed the months to
get this under control and to open

1361
00:50:45.772 --> 00:50:46.022
get this under control and to open
“P

1362
00:50:46.022 --> 00:50:47.980
get this under control and to open
up the economy in a big way. You

1363
00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.564
up the economy in a big way. You
have seen in the last few months the

1364
00:50:50.564 --> 00:50:51.647
have seen in the last few months the
economy started to recover, consumer

1365
00:50:51.647 --> 00:50:55.064
economy started to recover, consumer
confidence returning. Is do you

1366
00:50:55.064 --> 00:50:56.022
confidence returning. Is do you
think coronavirus is under control

1367
00:50:56.022 --> 00:50:56.439
think coronavirus is under control
in this

1368
00:50:56.439 --> 00:50:58.730
think coronavims is under control
in this country?

1369
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:59.147
think coronavirus is under control
in this country? Cross infection

1370
00:50:59.147 --> 00:51:00.605
in this country? Cross infection
rates have been rising so we have

1371
00:51:00.605 --> 00:51:01.647
rates have been rising so we have
introduced new measures that people

1372
00:51:01.647 --> 00:51:04.064
introduced new measures that people
to follow them. What I am concerned

1373
00:51:04.064 --> 00:51:04.439
to follow them. what I am concerned
about is

1374
00:51:04.439 --> 00:51:05.272
to follow them. What I am concerned
about is when I hear from

1375
00:51:05.272 --> 00:51:07.272
to follow them. What I am concerned
about is when I hearfrom Louise

1376
00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:07.397
to follow them. What I am concerned
about is when I hear from Louise and

1377
00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:09.022
about is when I hear from Louise and
Ed this constant criticism. Of

1378
00:51:09.022 --> 00:51:10.439
Ed this constant criticism. Of
course, we should be held to account

1379
00:51:10.439 --> 00:51:13.897
course, we should be held to account
and we should get things right, but

1380
00:51:13.897 --> 00:51:15.772
and we should get things right, but
when Louise’s colleague, the Shadow

1381
00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:16.814
when Louise’s colleague, the Shadow
Education Secretary, talked about

1382
00:51:16.814 --> 00:51:18.439
Education Secretary, talked about
the fact that Labour shouldn’t miss

1383
00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:19.855
the fact that labour shouldn’t miss
out on a good

1384
00:51:19.855 --> 00:51:21.730
the fact that Labour shouldn’t miss
out on a good crisis, that is really

1385
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.855
out on a good crisis, that is really
quite unacceptable. This is a global

1386
00:51:22.855 --> 00:51:25.397
quite unacceptable. This is a global
pandemic and we all need to work

1387
00:51:25.397 --> 00:51:27.647
pandemic and we all need to work
together, we want to see

1388
00:51:27.647 --> 00:51:28.814
together, we want to see
constructive opposition, not people

1389
00:51:28.814 --> 00:51:29.439
constructive opposition, not peopla
just carping

1390
00:51:29.439 --> 00:51:30.022
constructive opposition, not people
just carping from the sidelines.

1391
00:51:30.022 --> 00:51:33.272
just carping from the sidelines.
That isn’t what the public wants. I

1392
00:51:33.272 --> 00:51:34.980
That isn’t what the public wants. I
think that is really unfair on the

1393
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:35.397
think that is really unfair on the
labour Party

1394
00:51:35.397 --> 00:51:36.189
think that is really unfair on the
Labour Party and the opposition

1395
00:51:36.189 --> 00:51:36.980
labour Party and the opposition
first up we

1396
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.064
Labour Party and the opposition
first up we have been supportive of

1397
00:51:38.064 --> 00:51:39.814
first up we have been supportive of
the government on many measures. It

1398
00:51:39.814 --> 00:51:40.189
the government on many measures. It
is our

1399
00:51:40.189 --> 00:51:42.022
the government on many measures. It
is ourjob to hold you to account

1400
00:51:42.022 --> 00:51:43.439
is ourjob to hold you to account
when you make mistakes and everybody

1401
00:51:43.439 --> 00:51:45.730
when you make mistakes and everybody
knows you are making a real mistake

1402
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:46.980
knows you are making a real mistake
in the test entries. The facts are

1403
00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.189
in the test entries. The facts are
there for the Alan’s point about

1404
00:51:50.189 --> 00:51:50.397
there for the Alan’s point about
elderty

1405
00:51:50.397 --> 00:51:51.439
there for the Alan’s point about
elderly people may be suffering from

1406
00:51:51.439 --> 00:51:51.605
elderty peopla may be suffering from
mental

1407
00:51:51.605 --> 00:51:53.772
elderly people may be suffering from
mental health. If you look at our

1408
00:51:53.772 --> 00:51:54.189
mental health. If you look at our
rare homes,

1409
00:51:54.189 --> 00:51:55.230
mental health. If you look at our
care homes, there are a lot of

1410
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.022
rare homes, there are a lot of
people with

1411
00:51:57.022 --> 00:51:57.647
care homes, there are a lot of
people with dementia who, because

1412
00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:57.814
people with dementia who, because
rare

1413
00:51:57.814 --> 00:52:00.439
people with dementia who, because
care homes haven’t had the testing

1414
00:52:00.439 --> 00:52:00.772
rare homes haven’t had the testing
for their

1415
00:52:00.772 --> 00:52:01.647
care homes haven’t had the testing
for their staff and residents and

1416
00:52:01.647 --> 00:52:04.855
for their staff and residents and
visitors, some of those elderly

1417
00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:04.980
visitors, some of those elderty
peopla,

1418
00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.689
visitors, some of those elderly
people, their conditions have

1419
00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.397
people, their conditions have
worsened. This is the impact of not

1420
00:52:07.397 --> 00:52:08.439
worsened. This is the impact of not
getting testing right, it is

1421
00:52:08.439 --> 00:52:12.730
getting testing right, it is
affecting many people.

1422
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:13.897
ﬂ

1423
00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:18.147
I want to get a question from Alex
Buckmaster.

1424
00:52:18.147 --> 00:52:20.980
Why can I return from a foreign
holiday, quarantine and see my

1425
00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:24.272
family at Christmas,
but not from university?

1426

what we are hearing is that because

1434
00:52:43.397 --> 00:52:46.855
what we are hearing is that because
of the rules in Scotland, different

1435
00:52:46.855 --> 00:52:47.730
of the rules in Scotland, different
households not mixing, students at

only speak from the perspective of
pub“:

1443
00:53:00.522 --> 00:53:02.147
only speak from the perspective of
public health which is we have seen

1444
00:53:02.147 --> 00:53:03.980
public health which is we have seen
this scenario in the United States

1445
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.855
this scenario in the United States
over the past eight weeks, a lot of

1446
00:53:05.855 --> 00:53:07.647
over the past eight weeks, a lot of
students came back, movement of

1447
00:53:07.647 --> 00:53:08.022
students came back, movement of
peopla across

1448
00:53:08.022 --> 00:53:10.939
students came back, movement of
people across the country and the

1449
00:53:10.939 --> 00:53:11.147
peopla across the country and the
world

1450
00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:11.980
people across the country and the
world into cramped student living,

1451
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.605
world into cramped student living,
which is hard to keep separate with

1452
00:53:14.605 --> 00:53:16.480
which is hard to keep separate with
shared bathrooms and kitchens and

1453
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.355
shared bathrooms and kitchens and
adding on top of that, you have

1454
00:53:19.355 --> 00:53:20.730
adding on top of that, you have
students who want to socialise and

1455
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.605
students who want to socialise and
they are least likely to comply with

1456
00:53:22.605 --> 00:53:22.730
they are least likely to comply with
mles

1457
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:23.605
they are least likely to comply with
rules which they feel are

1458
00:53:23.605 --> 00:53:27.564
rules which they feel are
restrictive on them. Let me ask you

1459
00:53:27.564 --> 00:53:29.980
restrictive on them. Let me ask you
as a global public health expert,

1460
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.814
as a global public health expert,
given how quickly this has happened,

1461
00:53:31.814 --> 00:53:33.397
given how quickly this has happened,
Scottish universities have been back

1462
00:53:33.397 --> 00:53:35.314
Scottish universities have been back
for a fortnight, do you think they

1463
00:53:35.314 --> 00:53:37.689
for a fortnight, do you think they
should have come back at all? I

1464
00:53:37.689 --> 00:53:39.730
should have come back at all? I
think they should have only come

1465
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.522
think they should have only come
back under strict guidelines, I did

1466
00:53:42.522 --> 00:53:44.439
back under strict guidelines, I did
in Article eight weeks ago where I

1467
00:53:44.439 --> 00:53:46.189
in Article eight weeks ago where I
asked for testing on arrival and

1468
00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:49.480
asked for testing on arrival and
after five days to catch all cases,

1469
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.355
after five days to catch all cases,
regular testing on campuses and

1470
00:53:52.355 --> 00:53:53.980
regular testing on campuses and
ventilation and bubbling and all the

1471
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.022
ventilation and bubbling and all the
different measures you would have in

1472
00:53:56.022 --> 00:53:59.480
different measures you would have in
place to make the campus Covid safe

1473
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.314
place to make the campus Covid safe
and it just

1474
00:54:00.314 --> 00:54:01.605
place to make the campus Covid safe
and itjust seems and all I guess I

1475
00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:02.564
and it just seems and all I guess I
ran do as

1476
00:54:02.564 --> 00:54:04.689
and itjust seems and all I guess I
can do as an the Adamic is lay but I

1477
00:54:04.689 --> 00:54:05.230
ran do as an the Adamic is lay but I
think will help

1478
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:06.855
can do as an the Adamic is lay but I
think will help them to go back

1479
00:54:06.855 --> 00:54:10.855
think will help them to go back
safely. We have got some students

1480
00:54:10.855 --> 00:54:17.105
safely. We have got some students
amongst our audience. Let us hear

1481
00:54:17.105 --> 00:54:19.147
amongst our audience. Let us hear
from Sinem. You are starting your

1482
00:54:19.147 --> 00:54:22.605
from Sinem. You are starting your
first year. I would just like to

1483
00:54:22.605 --> 00:54:23.439
first year. I would just like to
say,

1484
00:54:23.439 --> 00:54:23.730
first year. I would just like to
5“- young

1485
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:25.147
first year. I would just like to
say, young people like myself, are

1486
00:54:25.147 --> 00:54:25.897
say, young peopla like myself, are
being

1487
00:54:25.897 --> 00:54:28.480
say, young people like myself, are
being blamed for this second spike

1488
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.647
being blamed for this second spike
in Covid—19 and hearing for example

1489
00:54:31.647 --> 00:54:31.814
in Covid-19 and hearing for example
Matt

1490
00:54:31.814 --> 00:54:33.272
in Covid—19 and hearing for example
Matt Hancock making a condescending

1491
00:54:33.272 --> 00:54:35.772
Matt Hancock making a condescending
comment on, do not kill your grandma

1492
00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:36.397
comment on, do not kill your grandma
by matching

1493
00:54:36.397 --> 00:54:37.939
comment on, do not kill your grandma
by catching coronavirus and passing

1494
00:54:37.939 --> 00:54:39.730
by matching coronavirus and passing
it on, it’s very

1495
00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:39.939
by catching coronavirus and passing
it on, it’s very frustrating,

1496
00:54:39.939 --> 00:54:42.897
it on, it’s very frustrating,
because the use have been instructed

1497
00:54:42.897 --> 00:54:43.480
because the use have been instmcted
to Eat Out

1498
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.730
because the use have been instructed
to Eat Out To Help Out, told to go

1499
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.105
to Eat Out To Help Out, told to go
back to school and that is exactly

1500
00:54:46.105 --> 00:54:48.355
back to school and that is exactly
what we have done, but we are still

1501
00:54:48.355 --> 00:54:51.105
what we have done, but we are still
the ones being blamed. Tia. You’re

1502
00:54:51.105 --> 00:54:56.439
the ones being blamed. Tia. You’re
starting your first as well. Yes, I

1503
00:54:56.439 --> 00:54:58.314
starting your first as well. Yes, I
am starting my first year as well

1504
00:54:58.314 --> 00:55:00.189
am starting my first year as well
and I have been told that

1505
00:55:00.189 --> 00:55:01.605
and I have been told that
universities are returning for the

1506
00:55:01.605 --> 00:55:03.355
universities are returning for the
mental health of young people and I

1507
00:55:03.355 --> 00:55:05.772
mental health of young people and I
understand that and it is important,

1508
00:55:05.772 --> 00:55:09.522
understand that and it is important,
but the fact is that we are

1509
00:55:09.522 --> 00:55:11.397
but the fact is that we are
returning to university physically

1510
00:55:11.397 --> 00:55:11.939
returning to university physically
for four hours,

1511
00:55:11.939 --> 00:55:12.772
returning to university physically
forfour hours, I have eight hours

1512
00:55:12.772 --> 00:55:13.647
for four hours, I have eight hours
of lassons

1513
00:55:13.647 --> 00:55:17.564
forfour hours, I have eight hours
of lessons 3 week, four of which are

1514
00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:18.772
of lessons 3 week, four of which are
face—to—face and basically I am

1515
00:55:18.772 --> 00:55:19.314
face-to-face and basically I am
going and

1516
00:55:19.314 --> 00:55:20.730
face—to—face and basically I am
going and exposing myself to so many

1517
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:23.189
going and exposing myself to so many
other people from different parts of

1518
00:55:23.189 --> 00:55:25.397
other people from different parts of
the country, being brought together,

1519
00:55:25.397 --> 00:55:27.064
the country, being brought together,
sharing a kitchen, I know that some

1520
00:55:27.064 --> 00:55:29.564
sharing a kitchen, I know that some
of the holes share a kitchen and

1521
00:55:29.564 --> 00:55:32.147
of the holes share a kitchen and
toilets with ten people, we are

1522
00:55:32.147 --> 00:55:36.480
toilets with ten people, we are
being asked to come together for

1523
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.272
being asked to come together for
essentially four face—to—face awake

1524
00:55:37.272 --> 00:55:37.689
essentially four face-to-face awake
and we

1525
00:55:37.689 --> 00:55:38.730
essentially four face—to—face awake
and we are not allowed to socialise

1526
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:41.480
and we are not allowed to socialise
and I do not think it is massively

1527
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.689
and I do not think it is massively
beneficial for our mental health

1528
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:46.105
beneficial for our mental health
either, especially now. I am

1529
00:55:46.105 --> 00:55:46.272
beneficial for our mental health
either, especially now. lam being

1530
00:55:46.272 --> 00:55:47.939
either, especially now. lam being
told that if I go to university I

1531
00:55:47.939 --> 00:55:49.605
told that if I go to university I
may not be able to go home for

1532
00:55:49.605 --> 00:55:51.730
may not be able to go home for
Christmas and that leaves me with

1533
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:54.855
Christmas and that leaves me with
the decision, do I save my mental

1534
00:55:54.855 --> 00:55:56.647
the decision, do I save my mental
health now which apparently going to

1535
00:55:56.647 --> 00:55:58.022
health now which apparently going to
university well, or do I stay away

1536
00:55:58.022 --> 00:56:00.980
university well, or do I stay away
so that I can stay with my family

1537
00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:01.314
so that I ran stay with my family
and see

1538
00:56:01.314 --> 00:56:02.689
so that I can stay with my family
and see people more often than just

1539
00:56:02.689 --> 00:56:03.189
and see peopla more often thanjust
four hours

1540
00:56:03.189 --> 00:56:06.522
and see people more often than just
four hours a week and be at home for

1541
00:56:06.522 --> 00:56:07.314
four hours a week and be at home for
Christmas? Those are horrible

1542
00:56:07.314 --> 00:56:08.772
Christmas? Those are horrible
decisions that you are having to

1543
00:56:08.772 --> 00:56:11.272
decisions that you are having to
make and I feel for you

1544
00:56:11.272 --> 00:56:11.522
decisions that you are having to
make and Ifeel for you hearing

1545
00:56:11.522 --> 00:56:14.355
make and I feel for you hearing
that.

1546
00:56:14.355 --> 00:56:15.189
make and Ifeel for you hearing
that. Louise, Labour has supported

1547
00:56:15.189 --> 00:56:15.439
that. Louise, labour has supported
the

1548
00:56:15.439 --> 00:56:17.439
that. Louise, Labour has supported
the government in trying to make

1549
00:56:17.439 --> 00:56:19.147
the government in trying to make
sure that education continues and

1550
00:56:19.147 --> 00:56:21.605
sure that education continues and
seeing what is happening more in

1551
00:56:21.605 --> 00:56:24.355
seeing what is happening more in
Scotland, Scotland is ahead of

1552
00:56:24.355 --> 00:56:26.189
Scotland, Scotland is ahead of
England, particularly, is this the

1553
00:56:26.189 --> 00:56:26.397
England, particularty, is this the
right

1554
00:56:26.397 --> 00:56:29.064
England, particularly, is this the
right approach? It would have been

1555
00:56:29.064 --> 00:56:30.355
right approach? It would have been
incredibly constructive for the

1556
00:56:30.355 --> 00:56:31.605
incredibly constructive for the
government and I have attempted to

1557
00:56:31.605 --> 00:56:33.064
government and I have attempted to
support them and how to tackle the

1558
00:56:33.064 --> 00:56:34.105
support them and how to tackla the
virus

1559
00:56:34.105 --> 00:56:36.480
support them and how to tackle the
virus because it is not good for the

1560
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:36.689
virus because it is not good for the
pub“:

1561
00:56:36.689 --> 00:56:39.855
virus because it is not good for the
public to hear that. In terms of

1562
00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:42.272
public to hear that. In terms of
universities. We supported schools

1563
00:56:42.272 --> 00:56:46.355
universities. We supported schools
reopening. We want to see students

1564
00:56:46.355 --> 00:56:47.939
reopening. We want to see students
going back to university, but with

1565
00:56:47.939 --> 00:56:50.147
going back to university, but with
millions of students moving across

1566
00:56:50.147 --> 00:56:52.355
millions of students moving across
the country, it was always going,

1567
00:56:52.355 --> 00:56:54.480
the country, it was always going,
there was always going to be

1568
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.647
there was always going to be
increased demand for testing, there

1569
00:56:56.647 --> 00:56:58.689
increased demand for testing, there
needed to be clear guidance in order

1570
00:56:58.689 --> 00:57:02.355
needed to be clear guidance in order
to make campuses Covid secure and

1571
00:57:02.355 --> 00:57:04.855
to make campuses Covid secure and
there needed to be a proper Track

1572
00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:07.564
there needed to be a proper Track
and Trace system underpinning that.

1573
00:57:07.564 --> 00:57:09.980
and Trace system underpinning that.
Given that we are where we are, do

1574
00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.147
Given that we are where we are, do
you think it is right that students,

1575
00:57:14.147 --> 00:57:16.189
you think it is right that students,
we are not sure what will happen in

1576
00:57:16.189 --> 00:57:17.397
we are not sure what will happen in
England but students in Scotland

1577
00:57:17.397 --> 00:57:19.605
England but students in Scotland
will not be able to go home. It is

1578
00:57:19.605 --> 00:57:21.230
will not be able to go home. It is
grossly unfair to tell students they

1579
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.439
grossly unfair to tell students they
ran

1580
00:57:21.439 --> 00:57:23.939
grossly unfair to tell students they
can return to university... I do not

1581
00:57:23.939 --> 00:57:24.939
ran return to university... I do not
think it is right

1582
00:57:24.939 --> 00:57:26.355
can return to university... I do not
think it is right that we are asking

1583
00:57:26.355 --> 00:57:27.564
think it is right that we are asking
them to return to university, the

1584
00:57:27.564 --> 00:57:29.397
them to return to university, the
first time living away from home and

1585
00:57:29.397 --> 00:57:30.772
first time living away from home and
then being told they cannot

1586
00:57:30.772 --> 00:57:33.397
then being told they cannot
socialise and potentially not return

1587
00:57:33.397 --> 00:57:35.605
socialise and potentially not return
home to their families. Tia said it

1588
00:57:35.605 --> 00:57:36.980
home to their families. Tia said it
is about improving mental health and

1589
00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.189
is about improving mental health and
I think that will be deteriorating

1590
00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:41.147
I think that will be deteriorating
for it. It is really tough on the

1591
00:57:41.147 --> 00:57:42.480
for it. It is really tough on the
students and let us remember there

1592
00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.397
students and let us remember there
was an added problem for them and

1593
00:57:45.397 --> 00:57:47.439
was an added problem for them and
the universities, because of the way

1594
00:57:47.439 --> 00:57:48.772
the universities, because of the way
the government mishandled the exam

1595
00:57:48.772 --> 00:57:50.147
the government mishandled the exam
system, they ended up having to

1596
00:57:50.147 --> 00:57:53.105
system, they ended up having to
allow more people to be able to go

1597
00:57:53.105 --> 00:57:53.439
allow more peopla to be able to go
to university

1598
00:57:53.439 --> 00:57:55.522
allow more people to be able to go
to university and that was very late

1599
00:57:55.522 --> 00:57:57.397
to university and that was very late
in the day. Universities have

1600
00:57:57.397 --> 00:57:58.480
in the day. Universities have
stmggled,

1601
00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.189
in the day. Universities have
struggled, they have massive

1602
00:57:59.189 --> 00:58:01.980
struggled, they have massive
financial problems, to make their

1603
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.147
financial problams, to make their
rampuses

1604
00:58:02.147 --> 00:58:03.730
financial problems, to make their
campuses and accommodation Covid

1605
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.939
campuses and accommodation Covid
secure and then there was a massive

1606
00:58:05.939 --> 00:58:07.522
secure and then there was a massive
increase in students because of the

1607
00:58:07.522 --> 00:58:09.939
increase in students because of the
incompetence over the A—level

1608
00:58:09.939 --> 00:58:10.980
incompetence over the A-level
system. The

1609
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.939
incompetence over the A—level
system. The government have made it

1610
00:58:11.939 --> 00:58:13.980
system. The government have made it
even more difficult for

1611
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.730
even more difficult for
universities, even more difficult

1612
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:19.605
universities, even more difficult
for students and again, I do not see

1613
00:58:19.605 --> 00:58:21.980
for students and again, I do not see
them take an action, giving more

1614
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.939
them take an action, giving more
support to universities who are

1615
00:58:23.939 --> 00:58:26.730
support to universities who are
having to struggle with S. Alok,

1616
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.064
having to struggle with S. Alok,
this has got public health

1617
00:58:28.064 --> 00:58:28.855
this has got public health
implications and you cannot

1618
00:58:28.855 --> 00:58:30.730
this has got public health
implications and you cannotjust

1619
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:31.189
implications and you cannot just
allow

1620
00:58:31.189 --> 00:58:32.605
implications and you cannotjust
allow universities and students to

1621
00:58:32.605 --> 00:58:33.564
allow universities and students to
fend for themselves, they need

1622
00:58:33.564 --> 00:58:35.814
fend for themselves, they need
support and I do not see why they

1623
00:58:35.814 --> 00:58:38.397
support and I do not see why they
are not getting it. A number of

1624
00:58:38.397 --> 00:58:40.022
are not getting it. A number of
points there. I am not an expert in

1625
00:58:40.022 --> 00:58:41.772
points there. I am not an expert in
education but I think it is clear

1626
00:58:41.772 --> 00:58:45.064
education but I think it is clear
that young people, there was always

1627
00:58:45.064 --> 00:58:46.730
that young peopla, there was always
going to be

1628
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:47.772
that young people, there was always
going to be transmission and it is

1629
00:58:47.772 --> 00:58:50.189
going to be transmission and it is
whether you are off the view that it

1630
00:58:50.189 --> 00:58:52.147
whether you are off the view that it
is better to be safe and they are a

1631
00:58:52.147 --> 00:58:53.647
is better to be safe and they are a
long way from Granny and you could

1632
00:58:53.647 --> 00:58:55.230
long way from Granny and you could
argue that this is the time for them

1633
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.522
argue that this is the time for them
to get it, but the point is that

1634
00:58:57.522 --> 00:59:00.522
to get it, but the point is that
students go elsewhere. There needs

1635
00:59:00.522 --> 00:59:03.230
students go elsewhere. There needs
to be a plan and I think schools

1636
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:07.980
to be a plan and I think schools
have a problem. I got a letter,

1637
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.980
have a problem. I got a letter,
sorry, an e-mail

1638
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.772
have a problem. I got a letter,
sorry, an e—mail today, from a guy

1639
00:59:09.772 --> 00:59:12.605
sorry, an e-mail today, from a guy
who sits on

1640
00:59:12.605 --> 00:59:14.314
sorry, an e—mail today, from a guy
who sits on the parents, he is on

1641
00:59:14.314 --> 00:59:15.730
who sits on the parents, he is on
the Board of Governors, and he was

1642
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:19.314
the Board of Governors, and he was
making the point that he has got

1643
00:59:19.314 --> 00:59:21.355
making the point that he has got
teachers having to do Covid claims

1644
00:59:21.355 --> 00:59:24.147
teachers having to do Covid claims
and they are struggling to stay on

1645
00:59:24.147 --> 00:59:24.897
and they are stmggling to stay on
top and to

1646
00:59:24.897 --> 00:59:26.897
and they are struggling to stay on
top and to deliver teaching at home

1647
00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:29.105
top and to deliver teaching at home
for kids that cannot attend and they

1648
00:59:29.105 --> 00:59:32.522
for kids that cannot attend and they
need more resources. I was able to

1649
00:59:32.522 --> 00:59:34.605
need more resources. I was able to
pay for extra cleaning and extra

1650
00:59:34.605 --> 00:59:36.355
pay for extra cleaning and extra
measures, because I am a business

1651
00:59:36.355 --> 00:59:38.314
measures, because I am a business
and I think maybe it might help if

1652
00:59:38.314 --> 00:59:40.314
and I think maybe it might help if
the government could look at how

1653
00:59:40.314 --> 00:59:43.230
the government could look at how
they could support, to work out the

1654
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.939
they could support, to work out the
right protocol and provide funding

1655
00:59:45.939 --> 00:59:47.105
right protocol and provide funding
for schools and universities to help

1656
00:59:47.105 --> 00:59:50.564
for schools and universities to help
them deliver that kind of safe

1657
00:59:50.564 --> 00:59:53.147
them deliver that kind of safe
environment. 50, Alok, what is the

1658
00:59:53.147 --> 00:59:54.064
environment. So, Alok, what is the
plan? If there

1659
00:59:54.064 --> 00:59:56.647
environment. 50, Alok, what is the
plan? If there has been an outbreak

1660
00:59:56.647 --> 00:59:59.730
plan? If there has been an outbreak
in Liverpool, 87 cases, if we see in

1661
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.647
in Liverpool, 87 cases, if we see in
England what

1662
01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:00.855
in Liverpool, 87 rases, if we see in
England what is

1663
01:00:00.855 --> 01:00:01.272
in Liverpool, 87 cases, if we see in
England what is happening in

1664
01:00:01.272 --> 01:00:05.105
England what is happening in
Scotland, what is the plan? I will

1665
01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:07.147
Scotland, what is the plan? I will
acknowledge, it has been a tough

1666
01:00:07.147 --> 01:00:09.730
acknowledge, it has been a tough
time for young people. I have two

1667
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:09.897
time for young peopla. I have two
daughters

1668
01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.147
time for young people. I have two
daughters who are of university age

1669
01:00:11.147 --> 01:00:15.522
daughters who are of university age
and it has been very tough. There is

1670
01:00:15.522 --> 01:00:16.980
and it has been very tough. There is
the point about making sure that

1671
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.939
the point about making sure that
students are able to go to

1672
01:00:19.939 --> 01:00:21.189
students are able to go to
university, younger children to be

1673
01:00:21.189 --> 01:00:23.355
university, younger children to be
in school, I think that is really

1674
01:00:23.355 --> 01:00:24.730
in school, I think that is really
important for their mental health

1675
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:26.897
important for their mental health
and well—being and important in

1676
01:00:26.897 --> 01:00:27.522
and well-being and important in
terms of

1677
01:00:27.522 --> 01:00:28.397
and well—being and important in
terms of their development. We are

1678
01:00:28.397 --> 01:00:29.564
terms of their development. We are
working with the university sector

1679
01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:31.564
working with the university sector
to ensure that they have the advice

1680
01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:36.522
to ensure that they have the advice
in terms of keeping premises safe...

1681
01:00:36.522 --> 01:00:37.522
in terms of keeping premises safe...
(“an you see a

1682
01:00:37.522 --> 01:00:38.105
in terms of keeping premises safe...
Can you see a situation happening in

1683
01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:41.105
(“an you see a situation happening in
England like in

1684
01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:41.647
Can you see a situation happening in
England like in Scotland, where

1685
01:00:41.647 --> 01:00:42.689
England like in Scotland, where
university students are not allowed

1686
01:00:42.689 --> 01:00:46.022
university students are not allowed
to go home? Not allowed to go to the

1687
01:00:46.022 --> 01:00:48.189
to go home? Not allowed to go to the
pub? I hope we do not get to that,

1688
01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:51.355
pub? I hope we do not get to that,
but that does require... Is that in

1689
01:00:51.355 --> 01:00:52.730
but that does require... Is that in
your planning? We have always said

1690
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.689
your planning? We have always said
and we set it right from the start

1691
01:00:54.689 --> 01:00:56.564
and we set it right from the start
of this pandemic, we keep all

1692
01:00:56.564 --> 01:00:58.189
of this pandemic, we keep all
options on the table and under

1693
01:00:58.189 --> 01:01:01.522
options on the table and under
review. Point now is that we want

1694
01:01:01.522 --> 01:01:02.939
review. Point now is that we want
people to follow the rules and the

1695
01:01:02.939 --> 01:01:03.147
people to follow the mles and the
guidance

1696
01:01:03.147 --> 01:01:04.939
people to follow the rules and the
guidance that we put in place now

1697
01:01:04.939 --> 01:01:07.022
guidance that we put in place now
and if they do that, we will be able

1698
01:01:07.022 --> 01:01:10.022
and if they do that, we will be able
to get under control. You were a

1699
01:01:10.022 --> 01:01:17.064
to get under control. You were a
fresh ones! How realistic is it to

1700
01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:19.272
fresh ones! How realistic is it to
expect people going away from home

1701
01:01:19.272 --> 01:01:20.897
expect people going away from home
for the first time to university to

1702
01:01:20.897 --> 01:01:22.730
for the first time to university to
stay two metres away from literally

1703
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:27.147
stay two metres away from literally
everyone? It is of course very

1704
01:01:27.147 --> 01:01:29.064
everyone? It is of course very
difficult, but from what I have

1705
01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:30.439
difficult, but from what I have
observed, young people are very

1706
01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:31.564
observed, young people are very
responsible and they understand the

1707
01:01:31.564 --> 01:01:33.355
responsible and they understand the
reason that we asked people to

1708
01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.480
reason that we asked people to
follow the guidance on the rails and

1709
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.939
follow the guidance on the rails and
going back to the support for

1710
01:01:37.939 --> 01:01:39.147
going back to the support for
universities, we are making

1711
01:01:39.147 --> 01:01:39.939
universities, we are making
financial support available and

1712
01:01:39.939 --> 01:01:41.730
financial support available and
obviously they will have less

1713
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:41.897
obviously they will have lass
foreign

1714
01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:43.147
obviously they will have less
foreign students coming and that

1715
01:01:43.147 --> 01:01:44.689
foreign students coming and that
support is being provided on this

1716
01:01:44.689 --> 01:01:47.064
support is being provided on this
idea that we are somehow leaving the

1717
01:01:47.064 --> 01:01:48.689
idea that we are somehow leaving the
sector unsupported, that is not

1718
01:01:48.689 --> 01:01:49.147
sector unsupported, that is not
fair. Max,

1719
01:01:49.147 --> 01:01:50.105
sector unsupported, that is not
fair. Alex, what do you think of

1720
01:01:50.105 --> 01:01:50.814
fair. Max, what do you think of
what you have

1721
01:01:50.814 --> 01:01:54.147
fair. Alex, what do you think of
what you have heard? I think what

1722
01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:56.397
what you have heard? I think what
Alok said about going to university

1723
01:01:56.397 --> 01:01:58.772
Alok said about going to university
helping your mental health, may not

1724
01:01:58.772 --> 01:02:00.730
helping your mental health, may not
going home for Christmas is so much

1725
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.105
going home for Christmas is so much
worse than we going to university.

1726
01:02:03.105 --> 01:02:04.939
worse than we going to university.
So much worse than you not going to

1727
01:02:04.939 --> 01:02:06.605
So much worse than you not going to
university? I would

1728
01:02:06.605 --> 01:02:06.730
So much worse than you not going to
university? Iwould have

1729
01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:06.897
So much worse than you not going to
university? Iwould havejust

1730
01:02:06.897 --> 01:02:09.147
So much worse than you not going to
university? I would have just stayed

1731
01:02:09.147 --> 01:02:09.564
university? Iwould have just stayed
at home

1732
01:02:09.564 --> 01:02:10.939
university? I would have just stayed
at home and on all of my course

1733
01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:11.105
at home and on all of my course
onUne

1734
01:02:11.105 --> 01:02:12.897
at home and on all of my course
online which I am basically doing

1735
01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:13.689
online which I am basically doing
anyway, I

1736
01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:14.480
online which I am basically doing
anyway, lam having

1737
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.689
online which I am basically doing
anyway, I am having all but two

1738
01:02:15.689 --> 01:02:17.064
anyway, I am having all but two
hours of online lectures and I could

1739
01:02:17.064 --> 01:02:18.772
hours of online lectures and I could
have stayed at home and had

1740
01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:21.397
have stayed at home and had
Christmas with my family. I am the

1741
01:02:21.397 --> 01:02:23.605
Christmas with my family. I am the
only son, my dad has cancer, they

1742
01:02:23.605 --> 01:02:25.772
only son, my dad has cancer, they
have had such a difficult year and

1743
01:02:25.772 --> 01:02:31.564
have had such a difficult year and
now for them to know, they knew the

1744
01:02:31.564 --> 01:02:34.814
now for them to know, they knew the
risk of higher education and

1745
01:02:34.814 --> 01:02:36.730
risk of higher education and
infection and for them to say, there

1746
01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:38.730
infection and for them to say, there
is a chance you will miss Christmas,

1747
