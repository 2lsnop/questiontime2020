Welcome to our panel,

85
00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:46.987
Right, we are going to start tonight
not with one question, but with two.

86
00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:50.487
Can we hear please hear
from Suzanna Bell and Lee Andrade.

87
00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:54.654
Would you please explain to me,
a community nurse, how chronic

88
00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:57.070
understaffing in social care will be
tackled given the government’s

89
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.195
new immigration system.

90
00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.154
And, Lee?

91
00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:05.195
Hoteliers struggle all year to staff
permanent positions.

92
00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:07.404
Who will be recruited
into the seasonal positions that

93
00:04:07.404 --> 00:04:11.195
are traditionally filled
by the EU citizens?

94
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:15.112
Obviously this is a response
from both of you to the immigration

95
00:04:15.112 --> 00:04:16.529
proposals that we had this week.

96
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.945
Alison.

97
00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:21.362
Well, I think the thing about these
migration proposals that

98
00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:23.279
we’ve had from the Tories
demonstrate two things.

99
00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.695
Firstly, that the Tories
define a person’s worth,

100
00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:29.279
the value of their work,
by money, which I think

101
00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.154
is interesting, given
how hard some people,

102
00:04:33.154 --> 00:04:35.529
particularly in social care,
but in other aspects like retail

103
00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.487
and hospitality work.

104
00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:41.154
The other thing I find absolutely
mystifying about this is that

105
00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:45.654
I thought that BorisJohnson
and his friends in the Cabinet

106
00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:47.320
were free marketeers.

107
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.779
I thought they believed
in the free market.

108
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.779
But actually this immigration system
is going to be really bureaucratic.

109
00:04:55.612 --> 00:04:58.695
So, I think that actually it’s
going to be much more complex

110
00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:01.779
for people and I do think
that we are going to end up

111
00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.404
in particular areas like those that
have been mentioned with significant

112
00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:08.820
challenges and shortages.

113
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.862
But the one thing I hope that comes
out of it all is that for those

114
00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:17.445
people who do work in social care
that we work out a way through this

115
00:05:17.445 --> 00:05:19.029
to pay those people some more.

116
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.404
It is one of the hardestjobs
in this country and I am sick

117
00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:27.362
to death of people who work
in social care being on poverty pay.

118
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.487
Do you support the labour position
that was voted at party conference

119
00:05:31.487 --> 00:05:33.237
that there should be
freedom of movement?

120
00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:35.820
I think freedom of movement
was a good thing.

121
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.154
I think that the single market works
because it gives everybody a chance

122
00:05:40.154 --> 00:05:43.779
and an opportunity to learn around
the continent of Europe and to work.

123
00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.404
0K, Michael Portillo.

124
00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:50.862
Well, I think it’s extremely
important that we should not have

125
00:05:50.862 --> 00:05:54.362
shortages in the health service,
in care homes and in hotels.

126
00:05:54.362 --> 00:05:57.445
And I think the government
is going to have to show a certain

127
00:05:57.445 --> 00:05:58.695
amount of flexibility.

128
00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:01.820
There are some dangers I think
in the new immigration policy,

129
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.945
and that’s why they have said
they are going to have to adapt

130
00:06:04.945 --> 00:06:06.279
to what actually happens.

131
00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.945
I do think we have got ourselves
into a rather unhealthy

132
00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:11.237
position nationally,
where we assume that care workers

133
00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:15.404
and health workers are going to come
from other countries and probably

134
00:06:15.404 --> 00:06:18.779
not stay very long and probably not
move up through the system and not

135
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.904
be promoted to senior positions.

136
00:06:21.904 --> 00:06:25.529
And in hotels as well
and restaurants, only a very small

137
00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.029
number of the people who go
in as waiters and so on,

138
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.570
as chambermaids, have
the opportunity to be promoted.

139
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.404
I think we ought to get back
to a situation where more British

140
00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:40.404
people see the care industry,
the national health service,

141
00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:43.612
catering, hotels, see these
as careers and go to them

142
00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:48.654
because they want
to go to these jobs.

143
00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.612
Have the proper qualifications, have
training and have the opportunity

144
00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:55.279
to move up through the system.

145
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.945
I think there is something rather
decadent about the situation we have

146
00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:01.820
got into where we think
there are lots ofjobs that only

147
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.279
foreigners and probably rather
transitory foreigners

148
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.195
at that will do.

149
00:07:06.195 --> 00:07:09.487
I ratherjoin with Alison
in thinking that one

150
00:07:09.487 --> 00:07:12.820
of the consequences of this may be
that we will have people

151
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.195
who are very committed, who have
decided it is what they want to do

152
00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:18.570
for their lifetime,
and certainly, therefore,

153
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.362
are going to be better paid.

154
00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:24.029
I think the consequences of this
immigration policy are pretty broad

155
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:25.570
and pretty positive.

156
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.070
You said you could see dangers.

157
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.987
What are they, briefly?

158
00:07:31.987 --> 00:07:35.112
The danger is the short—term one
is that of course if the policy

159
00:07:35.112 --> 00:07:37.487
bites and there are vacancies,
then the government will have

160
00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:38.570
to respond quickly.

161
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.570
Lee, where are you?

162
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.987
What is your feeling on this?

163
00:07:40.987 --> 00:07:42.695
You heard what Michael had to say.

164
00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.654
I think the care industry
and hospitality industry

165
00:07:44.654 --> 00:07:47.070
are very different anyway.

166
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.320
I absolutely agree that the care
industry should be paid a lot more.

167
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.487
I wonder about the hospitality
industry, though.

168
00:07:53.487 --> 00:07:58.487
We are giving a double standard,
we are saying they should...

169
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.237
Michael is talking about maybe
rather than getting people

170
00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:06.570
in from the rest of the world why
not get British people to do

171
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.779
this and train them up?

172
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:08.862
Is that realistic?

173
00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:10.279
As far as you are concerned?

174
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:12.445
No, we are constantly
looking for staff all

175
00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:13.404
the way through the year.

176
00:08:13.404 --> 00:08:16.654
The bulk of our staff come
from the European Union mostly

177
00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:19.154
for the seasonal work
because we cannot get

178
00:08:19.154 --> 00:08:21.279
staff any other way.

179
00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:25.112
Why do you think British people
aren’t going for it?

180
00:08:25.112 --> 00:08:28.029
Well, firstly, they worry
about what they are going to do out

181
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:30.654
of season, so if they are only
employed for eight months

182
00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:33.529
of the year what will they do
for the next four months

183
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:34.570
of the year?

184
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.195
That is obviously a concern.

185
00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:38.570
You couldn’t employ them
all the year—round because you don’t

186
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.737
have the business for them
all the year round.

187
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:43.612
But I do worry about having a double
standard when you say

188
00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:46.487
you want to see people come
into the hospitality industry and be

189
00:08:46.487 --> 00:08:51.487
treated as professionals
and look to go forward,

190
00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.945
but on the other hand you say this
is unskilled work,

191
00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:01.279
it is cheap labour coming in to do
it, which doesn’t paint a picture

192
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:04.195
of professionalism or a job that
people might want to go into.

193
00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:05.862
George, since these immigration
proposals were mooted

194
00:09:05.862 --> 00:09:08.695
by the Home Secretary there has been
a fair degree of outcry

195
00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:11.112
from a number of sectors,
not least the hospitality industry

196
00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:14.320
and the social care sector.

197
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.112
How much of these proposals
are going to stay as is?

198
00:09:18.112 --> 00:09:20.445
I think the important thing
to remember, as we leave

199
00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:23.404
the European Union we have got
a chance to do things differently

200
00:09:23.404 --> 00:09:26.404
and to have an independent
immigration policy.

201
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:30.195
And rather than simply having free
movement with European countries,

202
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:33.945
we have got the chance to say
we are going to have a skills —based

203
00:09:33.945 --> 00:09:36.987
immigration system and not decide
on allowing people free movement

204
00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:39.445
just because they are European,
but to actually have people

205
00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:43.070
with the right skills
from around the world.

206
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.029
In terms of the sectors that
have been mentioned,

207
00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:49.612
it’s important to recognise
that the EU citizens that

208
00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:51.820
are here now working in those
industries can stay.

209
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.529
In fact, over 3 million...

210
00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:57.404
You know that there is unemployment
in the social care sector,

211
00:09:57.404 --> 00:10:00.154
there are jobs that can’t be filled
in the hospitality sector.

212
00:10:00.154 --> 00:10:05.195
Yes, but we need to try to wean
ourselves off this constant

213
00:10:08.154 --> 00:10:10.070
pipe dream of people coming
from other countries.

214
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.779
There are industries
that could automate more

215
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.237
to replace some of those jobs.

216
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:14.279
In social care?

217
00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:17.529
Not the care sector, no, admittedly.

218
00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:20.695
Do you think you are going to have
to realistically give some

219
00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:25.195
flexibility when it comes
to social care?

220
00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:28.987
The point I was making is we have
got over 3 million that have already

221
00:10:28.987 --> 00:10:32.154
signed up to settle here,
so there is a lot of EU citizens

222
00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:37.195
that are already here working
who will stay and can stay.

223
00:10:39.654 --> 00:10:42.195
We have also alongside this opened
seasonal agricultural workers

224
00:10:42.195 --> 00:10:44.362
scheme for 10,000 people,
and there are also special

225
00:10:44.362 --> 00:10:49.320
provisions for the NHS.

226
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.945
There is an NHS visa scheme
and there is a way for people to get

227
00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:54.862
points if they have less
than the threshold.

228
00:10:54.862 --> 00:10:56.987
There are lots of hands up.

229
00:10:56.987 --> 00:10:59.820
Let’s hear from the woman
here in the front in the pink.

230
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.279
Interesting what you
are saying here.

231
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:06.320
68 million people who now live
in England, going up, UN estimates.

232
00:11:06.612 --> 00:11:10.695
At what stage the panel think people
in this country have had enough?

233
00:11:10.695 --> 00:11:14.570
That we should close the borders,
completely close the borders

234
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.529
because it’s got to the stage now
there is no education, schooling,

235
00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:20.112
infrastructure, it’s enough.

236
00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:23.320
We are sinking.

237
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.820
Surely someone has got to see common
sense and say enough is enough?

238
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.862
You’ve got people flooding into this
country that cannot speak English.

239
00:11:31.987 --> 00:11:34.904
I come from London, in the national
health service everything is written

240
00:11:34.904 --> 00:11:35.904
in different languages.

241
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.695
How much is that costing?

242
00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:40.529
How much is it costing
for the interpreters.

243
00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:43.987
Sorry, madam, how much is it costing
for the interpreters?

244
00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:46.612
I was in hospital last week,
the interpreter never turned up

245
00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:48.320
for the peopla who couldn’t speak
English.

246
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.612
She was paid, they all had to go
on and all the radiologists stood

247
00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:52.945
around doing nothing.

248
00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:55.154
What sort of country
is allowing this? is allowing

249
00:11:55.154 --> 00:11:59.070
this tourism to come in,

250
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.237
arrive on a plane, you get free
service, you can have your babies,

251
00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:04.612
you can just carry
on having it all forfree.

252
00:12:04.612 --> 00:12:09.612
Why haven’t they got points set up
in the hospitals and you pay it

253
00:12:09.904 --> 00:12:12.362
like you do in every other country
you go to?

254
00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:15.404
You wouldn’t turn up in America
and be allowed to go for free.

255
00:12:15.404 --> 00:12:19.320
OK, let’s let the panel answered
some of those points.

256
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.654
OK, let’s let the panel answer
some of those points.

257
00:12:21.654 --> 00:12:23.654
Strongly made.

258
00:12:23.654 --> 00:12:26.529
One thing is I wouldn’t presume
to know what kind of nonsense

259
00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:28.945
I get up to in America,
but that’s another story.

260
00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:32.029
On this matter of health tourism
what has been found is that migrants

261
00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:34.862
to this country bringing more
and contribute more in tax

262
00:12:34.862 --> 00:12:37.237
to this country bring more
and contribute more in tax

263
00:12:37.237 --> 00:12:38.945
than they take out of the system.

264
00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:39.945
It’s rubbish.

265
00:12:39.945 --> 00:12:40.987
No, it’s true.

266
00:12:40.987 --> 00:12:44.820
It’s a fact, sorry I don’t care
what you think, it’s a fact.

267
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.987
Migrants, particularly
when they are young,

268
00:12:46.987 --> 00:12:49.904
they are working age,
they are contributing to the private

269
00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:52.737
sector in the form of paying rent,
through paying for their cost

270
00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:55.195
of living in this country,
and also contributing in this

271
00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:59.695
country through taxes.

272
00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:02.529
When it comes to Britain,
we have an ageing population,

273
00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:06.195
so you have got more and more people
who will age out of the workforce

274
00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:09.320
and at the moment with our birth
rate we don’t have enough people

275
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.612
ageing into the workforce to be able
to support the kind of social care

276
00:13:12.612 --> 00:13:14.820
and pensions needs which are only
going to grow.

277
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.945
But one thing that I really
want to say because this is really

278
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:21.070
important to me is I don’t
want to make the case for migration

279
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.945
on GDP and the labourforce,
I want to make the human

280
00:13:23.945 --> 00:13:24.945
case for it.

281
00:13:24.945 --> 00:13:28.820
My grandmother came to this country,
she was 17, and it was to fill a gap

282
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.487
in the labour market
which still exists,

283
00:13:30.487 --> 00:13:31.904
which is in social care.

284
00:13:31.904 --> 00:13:34.945
Under these rules she wouldn’t have
been able to come to this country,

285
00:13:34.945 --> 00:13:38.237
she wouldn’t have been able
to meet my grandfather,

286
00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:40.320
fall in love, have children,
have some grandchildren.

287
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.195
I know many of you will not
agree that all of her

288
00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:47.195
grandchildren are a good idea,
but, we exist.

289
00:13:47.195 --> 00:13:50.279
That is a human story,
that has got worth and it has got

290
00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:52.445
a value which cannot be measured
purely in GDP.

291
00:13:52.445 --> 00:13:54.862
I understand that, but why
would you prefer European countries

292
00:13:54.862 --> 00:13:56.279
over other countries in the world.

293
00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.945
I think this is the point,
you should have a system

294
00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:01.362
that is around the people that
you need, the skills

295
00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:03.987
shortages you have, not
about the fact that they are from

296
00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:05.195
European countries.

297
00:14:05.195 --> 00:14:07.820
Here are two things I think
are good about this policy,

298
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.695
and you’ll never hear me praising
the Conservative government.

299
00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:12.820
Getting rid of the £30,000
threshold, which was

300
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.904
completely bonkers

301
00:14:13.904 --> 00:14:15.445
and an arbitrary cap.

302
00:14:15.445 --> 00:14:18.154
However, I don’t believe that
by making conditions worse for EU

303
00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:20.779
nationals we are actually making
them betterfor non—EU nationals.

304
00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:23.654
I’d like to get round a little bit
more of the audience.

305
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.904
Yes, the women in the
black and white top.

306
00:14:25.904 --> 00:14:28.320
Hello, yes, getting back
to your previous comment about why

307
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.320
do these people not stay
in theirjobs?

308
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.404
I think it boils down to the fact
that we don’t value enough

309
00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:37.112
of our own people and pay them
enough and value them

310
00:14:37.112 --> 00:14:42.070
much more strongly.

311
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.612
Why should we deem a foreigner could
do a job because they are paid less?

312
00:14:45.612 --> 00:14:49.487
It is absolutely outrageous.

313
00:14:49.487 --> 00:14:52.820
We need to address the social care
crisis anyway and I think we must

314
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.820
start with valuing them more
and pay them well.

315
00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:03.945
The man in the orange top.

316
00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:07.904
Any illusion that BorisJohnson
might have been a bit neutered

317
00:15:07.904 --> 00:15:10.529
after his election win has kind
of gone out the window.

318
00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:14.070
It’s nationalism to me.

319
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.070
It’s picking someone over,
I don’t know, the bit

320
00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:21.404
of land they were born on.

321
00:15:21.404 --> 00:15:23.570
If they’ve got the skills,
they should be given

322
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.654
the chance to move on up.

323
00:15:25.654 --> 00:15:28.070
It seems a bit worrying,
it is not the Brexit

324
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.654
dream of 350 million,
Utopia.

325
00:15:30.654 --> 00:15:34.029
It’s kind of the first realistic,
grim step and it will be a bit

326
00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:37.154
of a scary wake up call and people
might have a few regrets.

327
00:15:37.154 --> 00:15:39.404
OK, the woman in the glasses there.

328
00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:43.779
How are care homes going to be able
to manage to pay care workers higher

329
00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:46.904
wages when they are short of money?

330
00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:50.820
Lots of care homes
are closing anyhow.

331
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.070
Surely that’s going to be a huge
problem in the future?

332
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.195
Can we hear from you on this,
you are particularly concerned.

333
00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:00.862
You work in the social care sector.

334
00:16:00.862 --> 00:16:04.237
Yes, I do, I’m a community nurse,
I work in community nursing,

335
00:16:04.237 --> 00:16:06.862
caring for these people that
require social care.

336
00:16:06.862 --> 00:16:10.029
12% of the health and social care
workforce are foreign nationals.

337
00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:12.737
We couldn’t function without them
and so discouraging them from coming

338
00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:16.779
to work in social care
is going to cause the social care

339
00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:21.112
system to collapse even further
than it already has and is a scary

340
00:16:21.112 --> 00:16:24.654
thought that people like myself
are going to be picking up

341
00:16:24.654 --> 00:16:27.779
the mess of these people
who are going to become ill and not

342
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.487
have the care that they need.

343
00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:31.654
I’m going to come
to you in a minute.

344
00:16:31.654 --> 00:16:33.779
George, I want to put
that point to you.

345
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.695
I thought you had
forgotten I was here.

346
00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:40.737
No, I hadn’t forgotten.

347
00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:47.070
Provision was made to allow in care
workers in the previous immigration

348
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.987
bill which was just over a year ago.

349
00:16:48.987 --> 00:16:50.237
That has been dropped now.

350
00:16:50.237 --> 00:16:52.820
Did it matter then but it hasn’t
it doesn’t matter now?

351
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.237
I think the point is that the 3
million or so here are staying

352
00:16:56.237 --> 00:16:57.904
and they can stay in those roles.

353
00:16:57.904 --> 00:17:00.070
As Michael said earlier
we have to basically start

354
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.904
training our own workforce in these
areas and value some of these

355
00:17:02.904 --> 00:17:04.154
careers and these jobs more.

356
00:17:04.154 --> 00:17:05.945
I think we can do that.

357
00:17:05.945 --> 00:17:08.362
We need to start training
and having our own home—grown

358
00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:12.862
talent in these areas.

359
00:17:12.862 --> 00:17:14.445
We have nearly full employment.

360
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:17.070
Are you confident, and you know
about business, are you confident

361
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.362
we will find these people?

362
00:17:18.362 --> 00:17:20.820
Not in the particular
areas that were created.

363
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.404
We do have almost full employment,
but speaking from the perspective

364
00:17:24.404 --> 00:17:27.070
of an employer, obviously employers
have been in dialogue

365
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.612
with the government
about what its immigration policy

366
00:17:30.612 --> 00:17:35.570
should be, hearing in mind
the needs of the economy.

367
00:17:38.945 --> 00:17:42.320
And I think what they’ve come up
with is in some ways not bad.

368
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.945
I agree with Ash about
the reduction in salary.

369
00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:48.612
But there are two areas,
and you hit on them precisely,

370
00:17:48.612 --> 00:17:51.029
the double question,
where I think they’ve got it wrong.

371
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.195
One is social care and
the other is hospitality.

372
00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:55.779
But I think the solutions are very
different in each case.

373
00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:58.695
I think in the case of hospitality,
what we need is something

374
00:17:58.695 --> 00:18:00.987
like what George referred
to about migrant workers etc

375
00:18:00.987 --> 00:18:04.695
in agriculture, and I think
we probably need something

376
00:18:04.695 --> 00:18:09.654
equivalent in hospitality
because I do know that particularly

377
00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:13.362
in relatively well off areas
where it is expensive to live,

378
00:18:13.362 --> 00:18:15.695
it’s actually very difficult
to recruit local workers for hotels

379
00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:17.320
and restaurants and stuff.

380
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.737
In social care, I think it’s
a completely different question.

381
00:18:20.737 --> 00:18:23.820
And there, I think, we are awaiting,
and have been for some time,

382
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.862
a government policy on social care.

383
00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:32.862
Of course, there was an attempt
at it in the famous Theresa May

384
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.237
manifesto that crashed and burned,
if you recall.

385
00:18:35.237 --> 00:18:38.070
And the Prime Minister said
there was a plan ready to go

386
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.237
when he stood on the steps
of Downing Street.

387
00:18:40.237 --> 00:18:45.279
Exactly, and that’s what we need.

388
00:18:46.404 --> 00:18:48.654
Because the problem
is the social care

389
00:18:48.654 --> 00:18:50.070
sector is underfunded

390
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.737
and as a result there are all sorts
of false incentives,

391
00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:56.070
the NHS has an incentive to dump
people out of the NHS into social

392
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.445
care, but social care has got
an incentive to dump

393
00:18:58.445 --> 00:19:00.404
people back into the NHS,
particularly older people.

394
00:19:00.404 --> 00:19:03.529
And this has got to be sorted out,
and that, I don’t think,

395
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:05.237
is primarily an immigration
question at origin.

396
00:19:05.237 --> 00:19:07.154
It’s about how we fund social care.

397
00:19:07.154 --> 00:19:10.237
So these are the two gaps
in the policy, but they do need

398
00:19:10.237 --> 00:19:11.279
different solutions.

399
00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:12.904
The man there with the glasses.

400
00:19:12.904 --> 00:19:16.404
One of the pitfalls,
or potential pitfalls of the points

401
00:19:16.404 --> 00:19:21.362
system that has been proposed,
I think is, with regards

402
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:25.195
to the minimum wages scale,
which has been pitched

403
00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:28.195
at about £25,000.

404
00:19:28.195 --> 00:19:31.695
It’s going to backfire
and cause further problems,

405
00:19:31.695 --> 00:19:35.529
at least in the health care system,
because the current salary

406
00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:40.320
of the health care people
is about 16, £17,000.

407
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.945
And they do not reach that
threshold of £25,000.

408
00:19:42.945 --> 00:19:45.404
They miss out on 20
points straightaway

409
00:19:45.404 --> 00:19:47.154
which will backfire,
I think.

410
00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:52.154
The man at the back.

411
00:19:52.654 --> 00:19:57.612
People coming over into the country
looking forjobs in the social care

412
00:19:57.612 --> 00:20:01.654
industry, like the NHS
and the welfare state,

413
00:20:01.654 --> 00:20:04.487
how can they be ensured theirjob
will pay them well enough?

414
00:20:04.487 --> 00:20:06.737
Because economic conditions
like austerity have resulted

415
00:20:06.737 --> 00:20:09.612
in people in the NHS leaving,
going on strike, not providing care

416
00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:11.945
for people who need it.

417
00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:14.820
OK, the woman there with her hand
up in the black top.

418
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.987
How do you think people feel
about being labelled

419
00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:18.570
a low skilled worker?

420
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.195
APPLAUSE.

421
00:20:21.195 --> 00:20:24.612
I think it’s divisive.

422
00:20:24.612 --> 00:20:27.320
Care is not low skilled.

423
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.320
Care is highly skilled,
highly skilled.

424
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.904
It’s not paid enough,
but is a highly skilled job.

425
00:20:33.904 --> 00:20:37.987
I would love the government,
as part of this, to bring forward

426
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.404
a proper care workforce plan
so we can see whether...

427
00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:43.445
Of course we want British people
to work in the care sector,

428
00:20:43.445 --> 00:20:46.904
but we want it to be a really good
job where people can progress

429
00:20:46.904 --> 00:20:49.737
on and be paid enough to feel
the dignity and self—respect

430
00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:51.904
for doing what is a really
highly skilled job.

431
00:20:51.904 --> 00:20:55.362
APPLAUSE.

432
00:20:55.362 --> 00:20:59.737
Michael?

433
00:20:59.737 --> 00:21:03.362
I mean, maybe in a way to summarise,
I don’t think we should be proud

434
00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:07.779
as a country of having run
an immigration policy that meant

435
00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:10.987
that lots of our vital services have
depended on cheap labour coming

436
00:21:10.987 --> 00:21:13.987
from outside, which has not only
meant we are dependent on that,

437
00:21:13.987 --> 00:21:16.862
but it’s also driven down the wages
of people in this country.

438
00:21:16.862 --> 00:21:19.654
And this has been happening for...

439
00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:23.654
What is the evidence for that?

440
00:21:23.654 --> 00:21:26.779
Well, it’s obvious, if you admit
a source of people that are willing

441
00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:29.904
to come and do jobs that British
people are not willing to do

442
00:21:29.904 --> 00:21:33.029
at that level of pay,
then all pay is going to be dragged

443
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:34.070
down by it.

444
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.237
What the data shows is that
where there has been a small

445
00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:39.404
amount of undercutting,
it is highly localised in particular

446
00:21:39.404 --> 00:21:40.529
sectors and particular regions.

447
00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:42.445
It’s not across the entire
workforce at all.

448
00:21:42.445 --> 00:21:47.445
I think we are moving...

449
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.404
ALISON: I think Ash and Howard need
to give you an economics seminar!

450
00:21:59.404 --> 00:22:02.779
I think we are moving to a position
where we will feel greater national

451
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.654
dignity because we are not doing
that, we will be inviting British

452
00:22:05.654 --> 00:22:09.029
people to be qualified and stay
in jobs and have a vocation and get

453
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:10.487
away from this rather
decadent position.

454
00:22:10.487 --> 00:22:12.654
I want to take a question
from Jane Edsell.

455
00:22:12.654 --> 00:22:13.654
whereabouts are you 7

456
00:22:13.654 --> 00:22:15.404
That addresses this
exact point, I think.

457
00:22:15.404 --> 00:22:17.987
As an economically inactive person,
what will entice me to fill

458
00:22:17.987 --> 00:22:20.862
the gap left by the exodus
of "low—skilled foreigners"?

459
00:22:20.862 --> 00:22:23.445
Because you are in the 8.16
million, I think it was.

460
00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:25.820
Yeah, 8.4 million.

461
00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.112
Cited by the Home Secretary
as the workforce we could draw upon.

462
00:22:30.112 --> 00:22:32.112
Many of those are students.

463
00:22:32.112 --> 00:22:34.570
Retired.
Currently sick.

464
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.320
Carers.
You would count.

465
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.404
So what would entice you,
as Michael says, rather

466
00:22:41.404 --> 00:22:43.904
than delegate this work to people
from outside our shores?

467
00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:45.570
I think it’s tricky
for me currently.

468
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.695
I’m retired, I retired early,
but I’m also on the edges of looking

469
00:22:48.695 --> 00:22:52.112
at caring for elderly parents.

470
00:22:52.112 --> 00:22:54.737
So there’s the potential I will be
stepping into that arena.

471
00:22:54.737 --> 00:22:58.445
So could you be enticed and be
part of this workforce

472
00:22:58.445 --> 00:23:00.237
Michael is calling for?

473
00:23:00.237 --> 00:23:02.154
Probably not at the
moment, I would say.

474
00:23:02.154 --> 00:23:07.195
Being on the edges of, as I say,
being wanting to care

475
00:23:07.737 --> 00:23:11.570
for elderly parents,
or being part of that plan,

476
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.862
that to me is more important
than going out and working

477
00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:18.445
and filling some of those gaps.

478
00:23:18.445 --> 00:23:21.154
Maybe others may be enticed
to do that, but for me,

479
00:23:21.154 --> 00:23:23.529
it’s not something Ifeel
able to do.

480
00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:26.987
Does it concern you?

481
00:23:26.987 --> 00:23:29.404
When Priti Patel talks about this
8.5 million, and then...

482
00:23:29.404 --> 00:23:34.404
It has attracted a fair degree
of criticism, it’s fair to say,

483
00:23:34.737 --> 00:23:37.362
the majority of those people are not
actually available to work.

484
00:23:37.362 --> 00:23:38.570
So what was she thinking?

485
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.154
I think the point she was making
was that there are people who can be

486
00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:47.195
drawn from that group.

487
00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:51.404
Not that all 8 million of that group
could or even would.

488
00:23:51.404 --> 00:23:56.320
But there will be some students,
there will be some older people,

489
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.195
for instance who might go
into a caring role and that might

490
00:23:59.195 --> 00:24:00.404
work for them, working part—time.

491
00:24:00.404 --> 00:24:03.987
But the point she was making was,
that’s a group that can be drawn on.

492
00:24:03.987 --> 00:24:07.154
But to touch on a point a gentleman
made earlier about the NHS

493
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:09.070
staff and the threshold,
because the threshold actually

494
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.404
with NHS staff doesn’t apply
in quite the same way.

495
00:24:11.404 --> 00:24:13.820
So to get the points
there are certain jobs such

496
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.487
as nursing where you can actually
come in on a salary

497
00:24:16.487 --> 00:24:17.529
significa ntly below that.

498
00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:21.112
If you are in one of those
occupations where you are at

499
00:24:21.112 --> 00:24:24.195
a shortage, including the NHS,
and of course we also have the NHS

500
00:24:24.195 --> 00:24:25.237
visa system as well.

501
00:24:25.237 --> 00:24:27.362
Howard, very briefly.

502
00:24:27.362 --> 00:24:30.487
We are obviously not
going to attract you,

503
00:24:30.487 --> 00:24:33.654
the woman in blue, into work,
into a position where we are going

504
00:24:33.654 --> 00:24:36.070
to force people to work
if they don’t want to.

505
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.987
But the general answer
to your question is,

506
00:24:37.987 --> 00:24:40.820
we have to have more flexible
working so people can fit it

507
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.487
in around caring responsibilities
and we have to have more lifetime

508
00:24:43.487 --> 00:24:44.904
retraining opportunities
so people can retrain.

509
00:24:44.904 --> 00:24:47.070
So the Labour manifesto
is what you just said.

510
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.154
That’s fine.

511
00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:53.112
1983, I think!

512
00:24:53.237 --> 00:24:56.529
Let’s move on, because there
are a lot of you that want to talk

513
00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:58.737
about this next subject.

514
00:24:58.737 --> 00:25:01.404
Before I do, I will tell
you that we will be

515
00:25:01.404 --> 00:25:02.737
in Middlesbrough next week.

516
00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:05.362
And after that we will be
in Tunbridge Wells with Labour

517
00:25:05.362 --> 00:25:07.779
leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy.

518
00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:11.362
If you’d like to be in the audience
you can call this number or go

519
00:25:11.362 --> 00:25:13.279
to the website and follow
the instructions there.

520
00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:21.904
So do come and join us
at either of those locations.

521
00:25:21.904 --> 00:25:23.570
It would be great to see you.

522
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.487
Let’s take the next question
from Hilary Maxwell.

523
00:25:25.487 --> 00:25:27.195
Have we forgotten how to be kind?

524
00:25:27.195 --> 00:25:29.362
Hilary, you are referring,
of course, to the tragic

525
00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:30.404
death of Caroline Flack.

526
00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:35.279
Absolutely.

527
00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:38.404
She in fact said on one
of her Instagram posts back

528
00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:41.779
in December, I think it was,
she wrote, in a world where you can

529
00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:42.820
be anything, be kind.

530
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.737
Ash?

531
00:25:46.737 --> 00:25:50.154
When I first heard the news
about Caroline Flack,

532
00:25:50.154 --> 00:25:53.820
like lots of people I was completely
shocked and saddened.

533
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.570
And after I was shocked
and saddened Ifelt,

534
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.237
in a way quite deeply angry,
because I thought that

535
00:26:00.237 --> 00:26:05.237
after Amy Winehouse,
I thought that after Princess Diana,

536
00:26:06.112 --> 00:26:10.154
this tabloid hunger to build up
young women in the public eye

537
00:26:10.154 --> 00:26:12.945
just to tear them down,
that we would have learned

538
00:26:12.945 --> 00:26:14.529
something from that.

539
00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.487
And I know that...

540
00:26:16.487 --> 00:26:18.404
Is itjust the press, do you think?

541
00:26:18.404 --> 00:26:20.987
No, all of us in some
way participate in this

542
00:26:20.987 --> 00:26:25.987
particularform of,
you know, media ecology.

543
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.404
All of us do.

544
00:26:27.404 --> 00:26:29.529
We use social media,
we drive the clicks.

545
00:26:29.529 --> 00:26:31.654
But ultimately I do think
that responsibility has

546
00:26:31.654 --> 00:26:33.570
to lie with the press.

547
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.737
For instance, when it comes
to tobacco regulation,

548
00:26:35.737 --> 00:26:38.029
you don’tjust expect smokers
to change their behaviour.

549
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:42.404
You expect tobacco companies
to be properly regulated.

550
00:26:42.404 --> 00:26:45.404
They are the ones feeding this quite
unhealthy addiction.

551
00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:49.487
I think there’s a parallel
there with the press.

552
00:26:49.487 --> 00:26:54.529
Serving the public interest is not
the same thing as, you know,

553
00:27:01.612 --> 00:27:03.779
meeting this quite ghoulish thirst
for details of people’s

554
00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:05.945
lives that perhaps
sometimes we should just not have.

555
00:27:05.945 --> 00:27:10.945
I think there needs to be a better
regulation of the press.

556
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:19.612
I think we might even need Levenson
II, so we can stop having a media

557
00:27:19.612 --> 00:27:22.279
that instead of holding the powerful
to account is simply ruining

558
00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.279
people’s lives for profit.

559
00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:24.362
APPLAUSE.

560
00:27:24.362 --> 00:27:26.987
Michael, you have been in public
life for quite some time.

561
00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:28.904
You’ve had yourfair
share of press coverage,

562
00:27:28.904 --> 00:27:30.112
some positive and some negative.

563
00:27:30.112 --> 00:27:31.154
What’s your view?

564
00:27:31.154 --> 00:27:34.279
I think my first reflection is that
I remember a friend of mine

565
00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:36.904
committing suicide when I was very
young, and when that happens,

566
00:27:36.904 --> 00:27:40.029
and you are close to the person,
you are left with a question

567
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:43.404
for the rest of your life as to,
was there anything you could have

568
00:27:43.404 --> 00:27:45.070
done, should you have spotted
something, should

569
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.112
you have intervened 7

570
00:27:46.112 --> 00:27:48.487
And so my sympathy is not only
with Caroline Flack,

571
00:27:48.487 --> 00:27:51.404
but with all those people who may
find themselves in that position

572
00:27:51.404 --> 00:27:53.529
at the moment and wondering
if there was anything

573
00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:55.320
they could have done.

574
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.529
I don’t think I do rush to blame
someone in this situation,

575
00:27:59.529 --> 00:28:03.404
in the way that I’ve
just heard from Ash.

576
00:28:03.404 --> 00:28:06.487
There is an article I think
in today’s Telegraph about a woman

577
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:09.612
who found herself in the same
position, that she had been

578
00:28:09.612 --> 00:28:12.695
accused of common assault
against her partner,

579
00:28:12.695 --> 00:28:14.529
and she was talking
about her suicidal feelings

580
00:28:14.529 --> 00:28:17.820
before it reached trial.

581
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.987
And when it did reach
the moment before trial,

582
00:28:19.987 --> 00:28:22.945
it was suddenly called off.

583
00:28:22.945 --> 00:28:26.279
And this woman was reflecting
that she might have taken her own

584
00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:31.320
life and then she found she didn’t
even have to face the trial.

585
00:28:32.904 --> 00:28:35.737
And that is a tragic thought here,
that Caroline Flack was clearly

586
00:28:35.737 --> 00:28:38.154
overwhelmed by this feeling
about what the trial would be

587
00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:39.362
and what it would mean.

588
00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:42.237
And she can’t even have known,
what were the prospects that it

589
00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:44.404
would even reach court,
let alone that it would

590
00:28:44.404 --> 00:28:47.112
result in an outcome.

591
00:28:47.112 --> 00:28:50.695
I don’t think I do blame
the Crown Prosecution Service,

592
00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:54.070
because I know they would have been
blamed if these steps had not been

593
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.487
taken because she was a celebrity.

594
00:28:55.487 --> 00:29:00.487
It is standard procedure that they
proceed even if the alleged victim

595
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.695
doesn’t wish to participate,
because that is very often because

596
00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:07.029
the victim feels intimidated.

597
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:12.070
It is standard procedure,
although I think it is rather

598
00:29:14.612 --> 00:29:17.987
a cruel one, and I’m not sure it
should be for partners in that

599
00:29:17.987 --> 00:29:19.654
situation, not to be
allowed to communicate.

600
00:29:19.654 --> 00:29:21.570
And Caroline Flack,
unlike some of the contestants,

601
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.779
of course, was a professional.

602
00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:25.404
She has been in the public eye
for decades and knows

603
00:29:25.404 --> 00:29:26.612
what it is to be...

604
00:29:26.612 --> 00:29:30.529
She knew what it was to
be in the public eye.

605
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:33.195
And there is a thing that
happens with famous people,

606
00:29:33.195 --> 00:29:36.320
which is we all love good publicity
and we all hate bad publicity.

607
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.695
And it is part of what goes
with the territory.

608
00:29:38.695 --> 00:29:40.612
So I’m not rushing
to blame anyone here.

609
00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.404
There are quite a few hands up.

610
00:29:42.404 --> 00:29:46.612
The man in the blue shirt.

611
00:29:46.612 --> 00:29:51.487
Hello, I have a unique
perspective on this.

612
00:29:51.487 --> 00:29:56.404
I have been a television producer
for the last A0 years.

613
00:29:56.404 --> 00:30:01.445
And also, today is the ninth
anniversary of my son’s suicide.

614
00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.320
He was 2A years old when
he took his own life.

615
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.195
But I know that the press
and the media can be really

616
00:30:09.195 --> 00:30:11.154
brutal in its ambition.

617
00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:14.862
I know that, I’ve been there.

618
00:30:14.862 --> 00:30:16.570
And unfortunately I’ve
been part of that,

619
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.612
and I hold my hand up to that.

620
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:27.529
But also, it can drag
in the vulnerable and spit them out.

621
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:30.362
It can be very, very brutal.

622
00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:34.779
And that’s what I would like to say.

623
00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:37.195
In terms of my son’s death,
there are many complications

624
00:30:37.195 --> 00:30:38.529
to do with suicide.

625
00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:43.029
There are many different reasons.

626
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:45.654
In my son’s case, he had taken
a prescription drug, Proacne,

627
00:30:45.654 --> 00:30:49.404
and he’d become very,
very depressed, psychotic.

628
00:30:49.404 --> 00:30:52.195
He suffered sexual dysfunction.

629
00:30:52.195 --> 00:30:57.154
Eventually he committed suicide.

630
00:31:02.154 --> 00:31:04.529
I am desperately sorry
for your situation, and I applaud

631
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:09.404
you for coming along tonight on this
anniversary and talking about it.

632
00:31:09.404 --> 00:31:12.362
The one thing I’m hearing
about the many things you are seeing

633
00:31:12.362 --> 00:31:13.487
is how complicated it is.

634
00:31:13.487 --> 00:31:15.654
Alison, I’m thinking,
and I’ve been following the story

635
00:31:15.654 --> 00:31:16.737
like everyone else.

636
00:31:16.737 --> 00:31:17.945
I didn’t know Caroline Flack.

637
00:31:17.945 --> 00:31:21.112
The press have come in for an awful
lot of criticism, perhaps rightly,

638
00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:23.029
but these things can be
complex, can’t they?

639
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:26.070
They can.

640
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.945
Firstly, I would absolutely
agree with you, sir,

641
00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:31.195
I think you’re really brave.

642
00:31:31.195 --> 00:31:33.862
Hats off to you and I applaud
you for being frank

643
00:31:33.862 --> 00:31:37.695
in the way you have.

644
00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:40.570
I also think of Caroline Flack’s
family and what they must be

645
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.445
going through, and having to deal
with this constant attention must be

646
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:44.529
very, very difficult.

647
00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:47.195
But I want to go back
to the question, which is,

648
00:31:47.195 --> 00:31:48.862
have we forgotten how to be kind.

649
00:31:48.862 --> 00:31:53.820
My answer to that is, yes and no.

650
00:31:54.154 --> 00:31:56.820
My experience of life
is that there is a huge amount

651
00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.779
of kind people in this country
doing their best.

652
00:32:01.945 --> 00:32:04.529
And there are lots of ways,
as we have heard described,

653
00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:09.570
where we are not kind.

654
00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.445
And there are two answers to that.

655
00:32:13.445 --> 00:32:16.612
The first is that we can all be
responsible for our own choices

656
00:32:16.612 --> 00:32:19.737
and we can all choose to be kind
to one another, which is

657
00:32:19.737 --> 00:32:21.154
what we frankly ought to do.

658
00:32:21.154 --> 00:32:24.362
And the second thing is, we need
to make the system more kind.

659
00:32:24.362 --> 00:32:27.404
So we so we know we need radical
investment in the mental health

660
00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:28.445
system in this country.

661
00:32:28.445 --> 00:32:30.112
But that goes through
every single aspect,

662
00:32:30.112 --> 00:32:32.320
whether that’s workplace culture,
to make that more kind,

663
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.987
or whether that’s the way
the NHS can or can’t react

664
00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:36.029
to particular conditions.

665
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:37.195
Let’s make that more kind.

666
00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:39.112
Let’s make the Department
for Work and Pensions,

667
00:32:39.112 --> 00:32:41.279
in the way that Universal Credit
functions, more kind.

668
00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:42.904
I think there’s lots we can do.

669
00:32:42.904 --> 00:32:45.362
But if the question is,
should we have a manifesto

670
00:32:45.362 --> 00:32:46.737
for kindness, I say yes please.

671
00:32:46.737 --> 00:32:51.779
The man here in the front.

672
00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.404
I agree with this thing
about being kind and my condolences

673
00:32:54.404 --> 00:32:58.195
to the gentleman over there.

674
00:32:58.195 --> 00:33:01.279
The fact is Caroline Flack
was a very, very sad case

675
00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:05.820
and the fact that she has
taken her own life is appalling.

676
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.154
But we have hundreds
and hundreds of veterans

677
00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:10.487
who are dying at their own hands
every single year.

678
00:33:10.487 --> 00:33:11.529
Where is the outcry?

679
00:33:11.529 --> 00:33:14.779
Where is the support?

680
00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:19.737
The women at the back
with the white T—shirt.

681
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.779
Kindness comes from all of us.

682
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.904
Are we not all guilty of not picking
up that phone and talking to someone

683
00:33:30.904 --> 00:33:32.320
and just merely sending a text?

684
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.445
It means far more if you hear
kindness rather thanjust read it.

685
00:33:35.445 --> 00:33:36.904
The woman there in the glasses.

686
00:33:36.904 --> 00:33:41.404
Me?
Yes.

687
00:33:41.404 --> 00:33:46.404
Well, I’d be the last
person to say the press

688
00:33:47.404 --> 00:33:50.279
is exonerated of anything,
but on the other hand if you don’t

689
00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:52.404
buy those newspapers,
and if you don’t read those

690
00:33:52.404 --> 00:33:56.445
newspapers, they’re not
going to make the stories.

691
00:33:56.445 --> 00:34:00.779
I think it’s up to us to pass
by those tabloids and not pay

692
00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:04.029
attention to the stories that
are in the tabloids.

693
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:06.154
We sell those newspapers.

694
00:34:08.945 --> 00:34:12.779
And of course much as the press may
or may not have a role to play,

695
00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:15.404
there is the role of social media
as well, which you

696
00:34:15.404 --> 00:34:17.737
touched upon, George.

697
00:34:17.737 --> 00:34:20.945
Yes, and I do think coming
back to the original

698
00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:24.320
question from Hilary,
that there is something about social

699
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.320
media, in particular Twitter,
that there is anonymity.

700
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.195
For some reason that has developed
a culture for people to think

701
00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:36.320
it is OK to be rude and to be
abusive and aggressive.

702
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.737
I think we somehow need
to try to break that cycle

703
00:34:39.737 --> 00:34:43.862
because this is a very,
very tragic, terrible case.

704
00:34:43.862 --> 00:34:48.195
I agree with Michael that it’s wrong
to point the finger at any one

705
00:34:48.195 --> 00:34:49.862
institution or organisation
because these are always

706
00:34:49.862 --> 00:34:52.445
very complicated cases,
but we have issues in our schools

707
00:34:52.445 --> 00:34:55.154
across the country at the moment
with teenagers suffering from mental

708
00:34:55.154 --> 00:34:56.987
health and depression.

709
00:34:56.987 --> 00:35:00.737
A lot of that is because they are
wearing their hearts

710
00:35:00.737 --> 00:35:04.154
on their sleeve, seeking validation
from sometimes strangers and not

711
00:35:04.154 --> 00:35:07.445
always getting it and getting abuse
and everybody is quite exposed.

712
00:35:07.445 --> 00:35:10.154
I think there is this point
about trying to get some

713
00:35:10.154 --> 00:35:12.904
courtesy and kindness back
into our discourse.

714
00:35:12.904 --> 00:35:16.570
There is something about
social media that means

715
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.029
it is absent quite often.

716
00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:22.529
I think George is right
about social media.

717
00:35:22.529 --> 00:35:27.529
I lead a relatively sheltered
life in this respect.

718
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.612
I’m on Twitter and this and that
and I’m nota big Instagram person,

719
00:35:33.612 --> 00:35:36.779
but I’m often amazed
by the virulence and hostility

720
00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:39.695
and anger that people will come out
with once they hide behind

721
00:35:39.695 --> 00:35:42.987
Cornish George, or whatever
handle they use.

722
00:35:42.987 --> 00:35:47.070
Is that your handle, George?

723
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.904
Have you just been outed by Howard?

724
00:35:49.904 --> 00:35:51.612
I’m famously not on Twitter.

725
00:35:51.612 --> 00:35:54.195
I decided early on it is not for me.

726
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:56.362
It doesn’t appeal to me.

727
00:35:56.362 --> 00:36:00.987
Let’s hear what Howard has to say.

728
00:36:00.987 --> 00:36:05.779
I mean, it’s out of this very sad
set of circumstances which I think

729
00:36:05.779 --> 00:36:10.779
show how tension can build up
in an individual and suddenly they

730
00:36:12.445 --> 00:36:15.320
can go from being in everybody’s eye
to being very isolated.

731
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.945
Also what worries me,
and Michael may be right about not

732
00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:22.987
criticising the CPS,
but what has happened

733
00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:28.404
to innocent until proved guilty?

734
00:36:28.404 --> 00:36:31.320
Are you saying they shouldn’t have
brought the prosecution?

735
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.237
No, I’m not saying that,
but I am saying that when this

736
00:36:34.237 --> 00:36:36.404
prosecution was brought
she was dropped from herjob,

737
00:36:36.404 --> 00:36:38.487
she wasn’t allowed to see
her other half, etc.

738
00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:39.529
That wasn’t the CPS.

739
00:36:39.529 --> 00:36:42.154
No, it wasn’t the CPS,
but suddenly you are isolated

740
00:36:42.154 --> 00:36:45.945
because the assumption is made that
you must have done something wrong

741
00:36:45.945 --> 00:36:48.529
and I think we’ve lost that innocent
until proved guilty dimension

742
00:36:48.529 --> 00:36:53.195
which I think is most unfortunate.

743
00:36:53.195 --> 00:36:56.529
But if we do get a debate
about civility, even if we can’t

744
00:36:56.529 --> 00:36:59.112
get as far as kindness,
we could get back

745
00:36:59.112 --> 00:37:04.154
to civility I think.

746
00:37:06.654 --> 00:37:09.362
And if that comes out of this,
there will be something

747
00:37:09.362 --> 00:37:11.279
positive from what is
a very unhappy situation.

748
00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:14.820
Let’s see if we can do that at least
for the rest of the programme.

749
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.487
It has been pretty civil so far.

750
00:37:16.487 --> 00:37:18.404
Let’s take a question
now from Carol Burgess.

751
00:37:18.404 --> 00:37:20.570
Why has BorisJohnson not
reacted to the appalling

752
00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.945
recent floods and had no
Cobra meeting?

753
00:37:22.945 --> 00:37:27.862
APPLAUSE.

754
00:37:27.862 --> 00:37:29.320
George, what is going on?

755
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.404
We’ve had Storm Ciara,
we’ve had Storm Dennis,

756
00:37:33.404 --> 00:37:36.362
record heights in rivers such
as the River Wye, and we haven’t

757
00:37:36.362 --> 00:37:38.029
heard a peep out of Borisjohnson.

758
00:37:38.029 --> 00:37:39.695
Why no Cobra meeting?

759
00:37:39.695 --> 00:37:40.820
Well, I have...

760
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.487
I know you have been very busy.

761
00:37:42.487 --> 00:37:45.862
What about him?

762
00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:48.695
When I was appointed last Thursday,
the first thing the Prime Minister

763
00:37:48.695 --> 00:37:51.112
said to me is, we’ve got
Storm Dennis coming up.

764
00:37:51.112 --> 00:37:53.362
We want you to lead
on that response.

765
00:37:53.362 --> 00:37:56.945
We discussed the possible
impacts of Storm Dennis.

766
00:37:56.945 --> 00:38:01.445
We immediately stood up what we had,
which is a flood response centre.

767
00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:05.570
That’s an equivalent really to Cobra
that is focused on floods.

768
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:08.654
Hang on, you’ve got a Tory,
your own MP, saying

769
00:38:08.654 --> 00:38:13.195
he was trying for nine days
to get emergency funding.

770
00:38:13.195 --> 00:38:16.112
You have Tory MPs calling
for a Cobra meeting because it gets

771
00:38:16.112 --> 00:38:19.529
all the departments together to make
a decision together about where

772
00:38:19.529 --> 00:38:21.945
the funding is going to go
and where the resources

773
00:38:21.945 --> 00:38:23.029
are going to go.

774
00:38:23.029 --> 00:38:24.195
That’s the point of it.

775
00:38:24.195 --> 00:38:25.820
There was one...

776
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.987
When the general election was going
on, there was a Cobra meeting then.

777
00:38:28.987 --> 00:38:30.987
Why has there not
been one this week?

778
00:38:30.987 --> 00:38:33.904
Because we have the flood response
centre and we also have local

779
00:38:33.904 --> 00:38:35.570
resilience forums that lead
on the ground.

780
00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:37.237
Have you had those then as well?

781
00:38:37.237 --> 00:38:38.445
Yes...

782
00:38:38.445 --> 00:38:41.654
So what is different this time
because it is worse this time?

783
00:38:41.654 --> 00:38:45.029
The difference this time is we have
had two consecutive storms in a row.

784
00:38:45.029 --> 00:38:47.820
But we were well prepared for them.

785
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.612
During the election, paradoxically,
because we were in what’s called

786
00:38:50.612 --> 00:38:52.987
the purdah period and ministers
weren’t in their departments,

787
00:38:52.987 --> 00:38:55.612
there was a slow start
to the response, and that’s why

788
00:38:55.612 --> 00:38:58.237
the Prime Minister convened Cobra
to get it back on track.

789
00:38:58.237 --> 00:39:00.695
That’s not happened this time.

790
00:39:00.695 --> 00:39:04.195
In fact, we’ve had 1000 Environment
Agency staff on the ground.

791
00:39:04.195 --> 00:39:07.112
We have laid 5000 metres
of temporary flood defences.

792
00:39:07.112 --> 00:39:10.529
We’ve had 90 pumps moving.

793
00:39:10.529 --> 00:39:13.487
We have protected around
25,000 properties over

794
00:39:13.487 --> 00:39:17.112
the course of the last week.

795
00:39:17.112 --> 00:39:20.987
And on Tuesday we did stand up
a comprehensive package of emergency

796
00:39:20.987 --> 00:39:23.862
support with funding for councils,
hardship funds for homes

797
00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:27.529
that have been flooded,
suspension of council tax for people

798
00:39:27.529 --> 00:39:29.237
who have been affected,
business rates relief,

799
00:39:29.237 --> 00:39:32.820
and other things besides.

800
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.487
Howard, in terms of the question,
the fact we haven’t heard

801
00:39:35.487 --> 00:39:39.404
anything from Boris Johnson.

802
00:39:39.404 --> 00:39:40.737
Is he unusually silent?

803
00:39:40.737 --> 00:39:42.404
We haven’t heard anything.

804
00:39:42.404 --> 00:39:44.529
Whether it would be useful
to have Boris galumphing

805
00:39:44.529 --> 00:39:46.195
around in his wellies,
I’m not sure!

806
00:39:46.195 --> 00:39:48.612
But Carol is not saying galumphing
around in his wellies,

807
00:39:48.612 --> 00:39:50.779
you are saying you haven’t heard
anything from him?

808
00:39:50.779 --> 00:39:51.820
No.

809
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.195
I think what George said
is probably fair in terms

810
00:39:54.195 --> 00:39:56.029
of what the government
have been doing.

811
00:39:56.029 --> 00:39:59.862
But I think the reality is that this
is all too late and after the event.

812
00:39:59.862 --> 00:40:04.904
I think what we have to realise now
in this country is that these

813
00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:11.570
incidence of extreme weather
conditions, and particularly floods,

814
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:12.029
incidence of extreme weather
conditions, and particularly floods,

815
00:40:12.029 --> 00:40:15.987
are what we are going
to have to get used to.

816
00:40:15.987 --> 00:40:19.612
What we are going to have to have,
as part of the Green new Deal,

817
00:40:19.612 --> 00:40:23.445
or whatever we want to call it,
we are going to have to have a major

818
00:40:23.445 --> 00:40:24.904
programme of investment
in protecting ourselves

819
00:40:24.904 --> 00:40:27.320
against the implications of climate
change and rising sea levels.

820
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.945
Sea levels are rising three
millimetres a year and over time

821
00:40:29.945 --> 00:40:34.904
that has an enormous effect.

822
00:40:34.904 --> 00:40:38.279
I was talking to a Dutch economist
earlier this week and I said, "Well,

823
00:40:38.279 --> 00:40:40.654
surely the Dutch must be worried
about all of this,

824
00:40:40.654 --> 00:40:42.112
given what we have got?"

825
00:40:42.112 --> 00:40:45.362
And she pointed out that actually
in the 19505 the Dutch had

826
00:40:45.362 --> 00:40:49.070
a terrible series of floods and went
in for a major investment programme

827
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.029
to protect the Netherlands,
since when they have not had floods,

828
00:40:54.029 --> 00:40:58.070
or they are very tiny
and they are very well protected.

829
00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:02.154
And I think this is now at the point
where we just have to say this needs

830
00:41:02.154 --> 00:41:05.487
a major programme of investment
to cope with rising sea levels

831
00:41:05.487 --> 00:41:09.070
and if we don’t do that,
then we are left with George’s

832
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:13.612
emergency measures and sandbags and
I don’t think that will be enough.

833
00:41:13.612 --> 00:41:17.820
We are doing that as well.

834
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:21.612
In the last five years we have spent
£2.5 billion on 600 projects

835
00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:24.279
protected over 200,000 homes.

836
00:41:24.279 --> 00:41:27.112
We are going to spend another
£4 million over the next five

837
00:41:27.112 --> 00:41:29.570
years on flood defences.

838
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.987
Had we not done the work we have
done in the last five years,

839
00:41:32.987 --> 00:41:35.404
there would have been another 25,000
homes affected by this

840
00:41:35.404 --> 00:41:39.570
most recent event.

841
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.279
So, it will be 9% of H52.

842
00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:45.779
Good, well done.

843
00:41:45.779 --> 00:41:48.070
He is an economist after all.

844
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.820
I’m sure his maths is right.

845
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.279
But he is right, these extreme
weather events are becoming

846
00:41:52.279 --> 00:41:53.820
more frequent, sadly.

847
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:58.820
We do need to invest
in flood infrastructure.

848
00:41:59.112 --> 00:42:02.445
That is notjust hard defences
in towns, it can also be using flood

849
00:42:02.445 --> 00:42:04.320
plains and soft dams and such
upstream

850
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.654
to try to slow the water flow
and that is something we are looking

851
00:42:07.654 --> 00:42:08.695
at very closely.

852
00:42:08.695 --> 00:42:11.612
If the government is taking it
so seriously, how come BorisJohnson

853
00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:14.237
hasn’t responded to the climate
emergency that was set by Parliament

854
00:42:14.237 --> 00:42:19.279
and the deadline to respond
to Parliament within that timeframe?

855
00:42:29.654 --> 00:42:32.070
How come Claire O’Neill,
who was heading up the COP

856
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.487
conference said, you know what,
he just doesn’t understand climate

857
00:42:34.487 --> 00:42:37.362
change and he told me directly
that he doesn’t understand myjob.

858
00:42:37.362 --> 00:42:39.987
To me as an outsider that doesn’t
fill me with confidence

859
00:42:39.987 --> 00:42:42.404
that our Prime Minister is taking
seriously the single most

860
00:42:42.404 --> 00:42:44.445
important political issue
facing our country today.

861
00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:47.612
He is taking it seriously
and you will see in the weeks

862
00:42:47.612 --> 00:42:50.279
and months ahead with a policy
that we have got, with

863
00:42:50.279 --> 00:42:52.904
the environmental that puts climate
change at the heart of it.

864
00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:57.945
Climate change is a big feature
of our future agriculture policy.

865
00:42:59.862 --> 00:43:02.445
Later this year, Glasgow
is hosting a COP and we have

866
00:43:02.445 --> 00:43:03.487
got lots of proposals.

867
00:43:03.487 --> 00:43:05.195
But Claire O’Neill
has left her post.

868
00:43:05.195 --> 00:43:08.070
She is the one who said that
BorisJohnson, lam paraphrasing,

869
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.945
she didn’t actually say this,
she said he doesn’t give a stuff

870
00:43:10.945 --> 00:43:11.987
about climate change.

871
00:43:11.987 --> 00:43:13.237
He didn’t say exactly that.

872
00:43:13.237 --> 00:43:14.237
I’m paraphrasing.

873
00:43:14.237 --> 00:43:15.404
He was the one talking.

874
00:43:15.404 --> 00:43:18.320
I think she said that after she was
replaced by somebody else.

875
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.362
Why, you are laughing at this
particular exchange.

876
00:43:25.945 --> 00:43:28.362
Yes, basically because the COP
situation, the big, global summit

877
00:43:28.362 --> 00:43:32.195
that we are supposed to be hosting,
is it in Glasgow or is it in London?

878
00:43:32.195 --> 00:43:33.570
Who is the president of it?

879
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.654
We don’t really know.

880
00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:37.529
It’s a bit chaotic and it says
a huge amount about our

881
00:43:37.529 --> 00:43:39.695
Prime Minister that the collective
decision of the government

882
00:43:39.695 --> 00:43:42.570
is that he is more holed up
in a country house somewhere

883
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.237
than he is actually getting out
there and offering a bit

884
00:43:45.237 --> 00:43:47.154
of support to people
who are experiencing flooding.

885
00:43:47.154 --> 00:43:49.779
I think the spirit of
the question is shouldn’t we be

886
00:43:49.779 --> 00:43:51.237
seeing a bit more of him?

887
00:43:51.237 --> 00:43:53.862
Don’t people want a bit more
reassurance that he has actually

888
00:43:53.862 --> 00:43:55.320
got his finger on the pulse.

889
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.904
I’ll come to you in a minute, the
women in the front in the classes.

890
00:43:58.904 --> 00:44:02.320
The reason I am asking is why has
the EU stopped dredging the rivers

891
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.654
and then they wouldn’t have flooded
in the first place.

892
00:44:04.654 --> 00:44:07.529
Why the EU did?

893
00:44:07.529 --> 00:44:10.445
Yes, why have they stopped dredging
all the rivers across the country

894
00:44:10.445 --> 00:44:12.987
and then we wouldn’t
have this problem.

895
00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:17.029
Over here.

896
00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:19.945
I don’t know if any of the panel
walked through Weymouth today.

897
00:44:19.945 --> 00:44:20.987
Yes.

898
00:44:20.987 --> 00:44:22.279
Idid.

899
00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:24.695
Did you see all the empty shops?

900
00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.612
Shouldn’t the government cut
business rates for starters?

901
00:44:26.612 --> 00:44:27.945
That would help the shops.

902
00:44:27.945 --> 00:44:29.862
You are talking about
business rates for those

903
00:44:29.862 --> 00:44:31.362
who have just been flooded.

904
00:44:31.362 --> 00:44:33.737
Secondly, what the gentleman
there said about HSZ.

905
00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:37.154
If you got the Chinese to do HSZ,
you’d have loads of loose change

906
00:44:37.154 --> 00:44:39.404
to do all the flooding relief.

907
00:44:39.404 --> 00:44:43.654
Michael.

908
00:44:43.654 --> 00:44:47.029
I sense the mood of the country
is that in all sorts of ways

909
00:44:47.029 --> 00:44:49.654
we want enormous change,
we just don’t want things to be

910
00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:52.445
done the way they have
been done in the past.

911
00:44:52.445 --> 00:44:56.487
With the floods it really
is like Groundhog Day.

912
00:44:56.487 --> 00:44:59.904
Twice a year this happens,
there are more floods,

913
00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:03.612
a minister comes on and says how
much we have spent.

914
00:45:03.612 --> 00:45:06.945
People locally say it has all been
ineffective and then we have a row

915
00:45:06.945 --> 00:45:08.612
about dredging the rivers and so on.

916
00:45:08.612 --> 00:45:11.320
It looks to me as though
the Environment Agency has lost

917
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.737
all public confidence.

918
00:45:12.737 --> 00:45:15.654
I think we really are at a stage
when we want something

919
00:45:15.654 --> 00:45:17.112
bigger and different.

920
00:45:17.112 --> 00:45:20.529
We want something quite exceptional,
a strategic look at how

921
00:45:20.529 --> 00:45:24.154
we are going to deal with this.

922
00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:26.862
It can’t surelyjust be
about building defences so we move

923
00:45:26.862 --> 00:45:29.029
the water further down river
and a different lot

924
00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:30.945
of people get flooded.

925
00:45:30.945 --> 00:45:34.529
Surely what we need to do is think
about how we can get the water

926
00:45:34.529 --> 00:45:37.445
from where it is falling to the only
plate which is safe,

927
00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:38.487
which is the ocean.

928
00:45:38.487 --> 00:45:41.279
That is the only place where it
doesn’t affect other people.

929
00:45:41.279 --> 00:45:44.029
I just don’t get any
of that strategic feeling.

930
00:45:44.029 --> 00:45:46.820
I think the comparison with HS2
is apposite in this respect.

931
00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.862
I’m in favour of H52,
but I do think we need megaprojects

932
00:45:57.862 --> 00:46:00.945
to move the water to places
where it is safe, rather than just

933
00:46:00.945 --> 00:46:03.404
this defeated repeated effort
of building a few flood defences

934
00:46:03.404 --> 00:46:04.404
here and there.

935
00:46:04.404 --> 00:46:07.737
The question is about BorisJohnson
who seems to be very good at coming

936
00:46:07.737 --> 00:46:10.195
to the House of Commons and making
very enthusiastic speeches

937
00:46:10.195 --> 00:46:12.820
about trains, or doing things,
or having energy, but when it

938
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:16.445
actually comes to getting
projects delivered he seems

939
00:46:16.445 --> 00:46:17.987
to be pretty poor.

940
00:46:17.987 --> 00:46:20.362
What did he fail to do in London?

941
00:46:20.362 --> 00:46:24.029
The garden bridge.

942
00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:29.029
Water cannon.

943
00:46:29.862 --> 00:46:32.279
He was going to have
an airport on an island.

944
00:46:32.279 --> 00:46:33.945
We’ve had all of these great plans.

945
00:46:33.945 --> 00:46:36.820
Had he done a photocell this week,
you too would have been

946
00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.195
the leading critics.

947
00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:41.320
One of the most surprising thing
is I have ever heard is that

948
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.445
Michael Portillo is in favour
of investment in railways.

949
00:46:43.445 --> 00:46:44.487
That is pretty astonishing.

950
00:46:44.487 --> 00:46:49.445
There is a point here,
you have a cabinet for a reason,

951
00:46:53.404 --> 00:46:58.404
it is not a one—man show
and there are issues like this.

952
00:46:58.945 --> 00:47:00.862
The Prime Minister spoke
to me last Thursday,

953
00:47:00.862 --> 00:47:03.029
two days before the impact
of the floods came

954
00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:04.070
through we discussed

955
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:09.070
what was coming up and we discussed
what the plan would be and we stood

956
00:47:13.737 --> 00:47:16.779
up all of our emergency procedures
and we had a thousand EA staff

957
00:47:16.779 --> 00:47:19.445
working out on the ground hard,
knocking on doors, warning people

958
00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:20.612
and helping to support communities.

959
00:47:20.612 --> 00:47:23.029
There is another point
to what Michael said as well,

960
00:47:23.029 --> 00:47:25.695
the lack of strategic thinking,
you have been in this department

961
00:47:25.695 --> 00:47:28.362
since 2013 and have been talking
about the floods since just

962
00:47:28.362 --> 00:47:29.362
after you started.

963
00:47:29.362 --> 00:47:31.737
Do you think why are
we still in the situation

964
00:47:31.737 --> 00:47:33.404
that we have been in for years?

965
00:47:33.404 --> 00:47:38.195
Know, because I can remember
when I worked for David Cameron many

966
00:47:38.195 --> 00:47:40.779
years ago now in 2007
and there was a flood then

967
00:47:40.779 --> 00:47:42.279
and there were 17,000 homes flooded.

968
00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:45.029
This time we have had
a worse weather event,

969
00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:47.445
the land is already waterlogged,
two consecutive storms,

970
00:47:47.445 --> 00:47:49.695
and is terrible, we have
had M00 homes flooded,

971
00:47:49.695 --> 00:47:52.779
but were it not for the defences
we build over the last decade,

972
00:47:52.779 --> 00:47:54.945
that number would have been more
like 25,000 homes.

973
00:47:54.945 --> 00:47:58.362
What we are doing is working,
but there is always more that we can

974
00:47:58.362 --> 00:48:01.445
do and that is where we need
to continue investing in the future.

975
00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:03.612
I’m trying to get as many
questions in tonight.

976
00:48:03.612 --> 00:48:04.737
Let’s take a question now
from Maggie Stansfield.

977
00:48:04.737 --> 00:48:07.404
Should we continue to support
the BBC as a universal public

978
00:48:07.404 --> 00:48:08.445
service broadcaster?

979
00:48:08.445 --> 00:48:09.654
AUDIENCE SUCKS AIR THROUGH TEETH.

980
00:48:09.654 --> 00:48:10.695
SOME "OOHS".

981
00:48:10.695 --> 00:48:13.112
I’m not sure what that
means, that sort of sigh,

982
00:48:13.112 --> 00:48:14.320
the noise in the room!

983
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.404
Howard, I wanted to come to first
on this because you were part

984
00:48:17.404 --> 00:48:21.112
of the Charter review for the BBC,
the review that happens

985
00:48:21.112 --> 00:48:23.779
to find out how much money
the BBC should be given,

986
00:48:23.779 --> 00:48:28.737
if at all.

987
00:48:35.029 --> 00:48:37.945
And you are part of the review
in 2004—05, and it looked

988
00:48:37.945 --> 00:48:38.987
at the licence fee.

989
00:48:38.987 --> 00:48:40.029
Yes indeed.

990
00:48:40.029 --> 00:48:42.654
The short answer to your question,
I would say, yes, personally.

991
00:48:42.654 --> 00:48:44.820
We looked at this 15
years ago and concluded,

992
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.195
the licence fee is a funny thing
in a way because it has several

993
00:48:48.195 --> 00:48:49.279
things up against it.

994
00:48:49.279 --> 00:48:51.112
One is, of course, it’s a poll tax.

995
00:48:51.112 --> 00:48:54.737
So the rich pay the same as the not
so rich, and that’s not normally

996
00:48:54.737 --> 00:48:57.404
the good way of taxing,
really, because you like to have

997
00:48:57.404 --> 00:48:58.404
taxes that are progressive.

998
00:48:58.404 --> 00:49:00.570
So it’s not good from
that point of view.

999
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.445
And the only thing it had
going for it at the time...

1000
00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:04.612
Well, two things really.

1001
00:49:04.612 --> 00:49:08.070
One, people actually wanted it.

1002
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.987
There was a majority
in favour of funding

1003
00:49:09.987 --> 00:49:13.987
the BBC with a licence fee.

1004
00:49:13.987 --> 00:49:16.404
So as economists, we would be
set there saying, well,

1005
00:49:16.404 --> 00:49:19.154
why should we sit there and tell
people they can’t have

1006
00:49:19.154 --> 00:49:22.779
what it is clear they actually want,
even if it is a slightly odd way

1007
00:49:22.779 --> 00:49:24.362
of doing it.

1008
00:49:24.362 --> 00:49:27.612
And what’s changed now is that it’s
clear that only about a quarter

1009
00:49:27.612 --> 00:49:32.195
of the population on recent opinion
polls do favour the licence fee.

1010
00:49:32.195 --> 00:49:35.362
So that has been a change over
the 15 years since I last

1011
00:49:35.362 --> 00:49:36.904
looked at it closely.

1012
00:49:36.904 --> 00:49:41.904
So I think the question
now has to be asked,

1013
00:49:42.154 --> 00:49:47.154
and the problem is that
while the BBC appears on free view,

1014
00:49:47.945 --> 00:49:50.612
and the problem is that
while the BBC appears on Freeview,

1015
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:53.945
it is not possible to determine
who is watching the BBC at any one

1016
00:49:53.945 --> 00:49:56.862
time, and determine whether you can
have a subscription service or not.

1017
00:49:56.862 --> 00:49:58.529
Because you are getting
it through Freeview.

1018
00:49:58.529 --> 00:50:01.404
I think in the long run,
in ten or 15 years time,

1019
00:50:01.404 --> 00:50:04.945
probably the BBC will have to move
to some kind of a different funding

1020
00:50:04.945 --> 00:50:08.987
model, a subscription model,
when the technology is available

1021
00:50:08.987 --> 00:50:12.154
to know exactly who is watching
what, and then you can charge them

1022
00:50:12.154 --> 00:50:13.862
appropriately for it.

1023
00:50:13.862 --> 00:50:17.237
In the meantime, I have to say,
I would stick with the licence fee.

1024
00:50:17.237 --> 00:50:20.404
Alison?

1025
00:50:20.404 --> 00:50:25.404
I reserve the right to criticise
the BBC when it does things that

1026
00:50:28.154 --> 00:50:30.487
I don’t like and puts
on programmes I don’t like...

1027
00:50:30.487 --> 00:50:32.362
Feel free, don’t mind me!

1028
00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:35.237
But I think we all have
to be a bit careful here,

1029
00:50:35.237 --> 00:50:38.112
because I think there’s a tonne
of things that the BBC does

1030
00:50:38.112 --> 00:50:40.279
that I can’t see really
a subscription service doing.

1031
00:50:40.279 --> 00:50:43.029
I can’t see anyone else doing.

1032
00:50:43.029 --> 00:50:45.195
Most primary schools in the country
watch Newsround now,

1033
00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:46.279
which is absolutely brilliant.

1034
00:50:46.279 --> 00:50:48.695
I can’t see anybody making
that for them for free.

1035
00:50:48.695 --> 00:50:51.237
There’s loads of programming
that we all know of that’s

1036
00:50:51.237 --> 00:50:53.612
absolutely brilliant that the BBC
does, so I think we

1037
00:50:53.612 --> 00:50:55.904
have to be careful.

1038
00:50:55.904 --> 00:50:59.320
Nobody should give the BBC
3 sort of free pass,

1039
00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.320
and we should engage
in our national support...

1040
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.237
Nationalsport, rather,
of complaining about the telly,

1041
00:51:03.237 --> 00:51:04.445
and even shouting at it.

1042
00:51:04.445 --> 00:51:06.404
I’m sure people do that
at this programme.

1043
00:51:06.404 --> 00:51:07.529
I know they do.

1044
00:51:07.529 --> 00:51:10.779
I’m sure they do, but I would say,
let’s all be a bit careful,

1045
00:51:10.779 --> 00:51:12.695
because the BBC is an incredible
national institution,

1046
00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:13.904
like the National Health Service.

1047
00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:16.237
APPLAUSE.

1048
00:51:16.237 --> 00:51:21.195
Pretty unique to this country,
and I can’t see a paid

1049
00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:24.779
for subscription service doing some
of the things that the BBC does.

1050
00:51:24.779 --> 00:51:28.445
Michael, as a former
Conservative Cabinet minister,

1051
00:51:28.445 --> 00:51:33.404
Secretary of State, what do you make
of these briefings that seem to be

1052
00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:36.279
coming out of Number 10?

1053
00:51:36.279 --> 00:51:38.945
In the papers at the weekend?

1054
00:51:38.945 --> 00:51:43.987
Do you mind if I answer
the question, the main question?

1055
00:51:44.987 --> 00:51:47.154
Well, you can do that
one as well after.

1056
00:51:47.154 --> 00:51:48.195
Yes, if you like.

1057
00:51:48.195 --> 00:51:50.112
Although that’s not
an area of my expertise.

1058
00:51:50.112 --> 00:51:52.279
But I have to begin
by declaring an interest,

1059
00:51:52.279 --> 00:51:54.945
because I derive most of my income
from the licence payer.

1060
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:55.987
LAUGHTER.

1061
00:51:55.987 --> 00:51:57.445
Bite the hand, Michael!

1062
00:51:57.445 --> 00:52:00.612
And therefore, you might be
surprised when I say that I do not

1063
00:52:00.612 --> 00:52:02.070
believe the licence fee can survive.

1064
00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:04.279
It’s partly, actually,
my experience of making films.

1065
00:52:04.279 --> 00:52:06.737
I make films with very young people.

1066
00:52:06.737 --> 00:52:09.404
And the young people
with whom I make films do not

1067
00:52:09.404 --> 00:52:10.404
pay the licence fee.

1068
00:52:10.404 --> 00:52:12.779
They do not have televisions.

1069
00:52:12.779 --> 00:52:14.695
They consume their media
on their mobile phones

1070
00:52:14.695 --> 00:52:18.445
or on their laptops.

1071
00:52:18.445 --> 00:52:21.612
And since, I think it was about two
years ago, when you went

1072
00:52:21.612 --> 00:52:24.445
on your laptop to download,
to go to iPlayer and catch up,

1073
00:52:24.445 --> 00:52:29.487
it asks you whether you
have a licence fee.

1074
00:52:31.112 --> 00:52:34.237
You now have to answer that
question, so they answer no and that

1075
00:52:34.237 --> 00:52:35.654
blocks them out of the BBC.

1076
00:52:35.654 --> 00:52:38.320
Therefore these young people now
have no connection with the BBC.

1077
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.404
They don’t even watch the programmes
they make with me because they have

1078
00:52:41.404 --> 00:52:42.654
no access to the BBC.

1079
00:52:42.654 --> 00:52:44.820
And the BBC is losing its audience.
And why?

1080
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.987
Because these people have any other
number of opportunities

1081
00:52:46.987 --> 00:52:49.362
to watch television,
and they consume it as they wish

1082
00:52:49.362 --> 00:52:51.487
and when they wish.

1083
00:52:51.487 --> 00:52:53.904
The other extraordinary thing
is that when you are abroad,

1084
00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.154
you cannot consume the BBC.

1085
00:52:55.154 --> 00:52:58.320
Or not BBC television, anyway.

1086
00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.904
So even though I pay the licence
fee, when I go abroad I am blocked

1087
00:53:01.904 --> 00:53:02.945
from watching the BBC.

1088
00:53:02.945 --> 00:53:05.570
And don’t forget the licence fee
is notjust for television.

1089
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:09.195
It’s all the radio stations
and online as well.

1090
00:53:09.195 --> 00:53:12.904
Yes, radio is a different question
and a much simpler question.

1091
00:53:12.904 --> 00:53:16.195
But I also think that if we talk
about television for the moment,

1092
00:53:16.195 --> 00:53:19.029
there’s not much evidence now
on the BBC that it is performing

1093
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.779
a public service role.

1094
00:53:21.779 --> 00:53:25.404
I don’t think there is much evidence
on the BBC now that they are doing

1095
00:53:25.404 --> 00:53:27.945
much that other people
couldn’t possibly do.

1096
00:53:27.945 --> 00:53:30.404
For example, in arts,
there are almost no arts programming

1097
00:53:30.404 --> 00:53:32.070
now on BBC television.

1098
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.237
You won’t see arts,
you would watch Sky Arts.

1099
00:53:35.237 --> 00:53:37.862
Wouldn’t you watch BBC Four?

1100
00:53:37.862 --> 00:53:41.862
But coming to the more important
point, not only can British people

1101
00:53:41.862 --> 00:53:44.029
not watch the BBC abroad
when they have paid

1102
00:53:44.029 --> 00:53:45.070
their licence fee.

1103
00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:46.737
Foreigners can’t consume
the BBC directly either.

1104
00:53:46.737 --> 00:53:49.487
And there are eight,
9 billion people out there,

1105
00:53:49.487 --> 00:53:54.320
who would be very keen
to consume the BBC.

1106
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.154
I don’t want to keep butting in,
but there is BBC World.

1107
00:53:57.154 --> 00:53:58.404
In the interests of accuracy.

1108
00:53:58.404 --> 00:54:00.945
BBC World is not a real channel.

1109
00:54:00.945 --> 00:54:04.195
The BBC is not proud
of BBC World, seriously.

1110
00:54:04.195 --> 00:54:06.820
I think the people who work
on BBC World are probably

1111
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.820
proud of BBC World.

1112
00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.320
I’m not sure that they are.

1113
00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:13.779
LAUGHTER.

1114
00:54:13.779 --> 00:54:17.237
But the point is, 20 years ago,
Netﬂix was a corner shop

1115
00:54:17.237 --> 00:54:22.237
renting video tapes.

1116
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.695
Today it is spending $10 billion
per year on content.

1117
00:54:24.695 --> 00:54:25.945
20 years ago, the BBC...

1118
00:54:25.945 --> 00:54:27.404
And it is billions in debt.

1119
00:54:27.404 --> 00:54:29.529
20 years ago the BBC
was a global name.

1120
00:54:29.529 --> 00:54:32.029
Today the BBC is wedded
to the licence fee.

1121
00:54:32.029 --> 00:54:34.945
It is like a polar bear
on a receding piece of ice.

1122
00:54:34.945 --> 00:54:36.529
APPLAUSE.

1123
00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:40.612
I have to get the rest
of the panel in.

1124
00:54:40.612 --> 00:54:41.862
Ash?

1125
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.529
I’ve got really strong
feelings about this.

1126
00:54:43.529 --> 00:54:46.695
I think the BBC needs to adapt
or die, but it shouldn’t adapt

1127
00:54:46.695 --> 00:54:51.570
in the direction that
Dominic Cummings and his team

1128
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:55.737
at Number 10 are angling for it
to change, which is to privatise,

1129
00:54:55.737 --> 00:54:59.112
commercialise and no longer be
licence funded model.

1130
00:54:59.112 --> 00:55:02.279
I think the way it needs to adapt
is to first be established

1131
00:55:02.279 --> 00:55:04.029
on a permanent statutory footing.

1132
00:55:04.029 --> 00:55:08.195
So you don’t have this brouhaha
every ten years over

1133
00:55:08.195 --> 00:55:10.529
the Charter renewal,
in which the government of the day

1134
00:55:10.529 --> 00:55:12.945
is able to exert a tremendous amount
of political pressure

1135
00:55:12.945 --> 00:55:16.237
by essentially holding the BBC’s
continuing existence hostage.

1136
00:55:16.237 --> 00:55:19.487
I also think we need to look
at things like a digital licence

1137
00:55:19.487 --> 00:55:24.487
fee, and also taxing some of these
big digital multinationals

1138
00:55:24.529 --> 00:55:26.695
like Netﬂix, like Facebook, Google,
which make tremendous amounts

1139
00:55:26.695 --> 00:55:29.487
of money in this country.

1140
00:55:29.487 --> 00:55:33.404
I know there are a lot of people
on the left who at the moment

1141
00:55:33.404 --> 00:55:35.862
are furious with the BBC
for elements of its news

1142
00:55:35.862 --> 00:55:37.737
and current affairs coverage
during the general election,

1143
00:55:37.737 --> 00:55:41.029
and I share a lot
of those criticisms.

1144
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:44.612
But what I would say to those people
on the left who are currently saying

1145
00:55:44.612 --> 00:55:47.737
they may as well support defunding
the BBC on political grounds,

1146
00:55:47.737 --> 00:55:50.612
is that handing over the British
broadcasting environment

1147
00:55:50.612 --> 00:55:53.570
to Rupert Murdoch,
which is what would happen if we no

1148
00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.279
longer had a licence payerfunded
BBC, is not a credible

1149
00:55:56.279 --> 00:55:58.279
left—wing position.

1150
00:55:58.279 --> 00:56:02.029
APPLAUSE.

1151
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:05.737
George, what’s going on?

1152
00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:10.237
There’s going to be a licence fee
model until at least 2027,

1153
00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:13.362
so nothing is being done
in a hurry anyway.

1154
00:56:13.362 --> 00:56:16.404
The BBC is a cherished institution,
there is no doubt about that.

1155
00:56:16.404 --> 00:56:21.404
But I think both Michael and Howard
have made good points, which is,

1156
00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.445
just see how media has changed over
the last decade with people now

1157
00:56:25.445 --> 00:56:30.154
getting their content
from smartphones, from iPads.

1158
00:56:30.154 --> 00:56:33.279
Imagine what’s going to happen
in the next seven years.

1159
00:56:33.279 --> 00:56:36.570
So it’s appropriate in my view
to think about what the funding

1160
00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:39.779
model should be and how best
you should raise money to fund

1161
00:56:39.779 --> 00:56:43.779
the BBC, because it can’t make
sense in the long term

1162
00:56:43.779 --> 00:56:47.112
to still have a licence fee based
on sort of conventional

1163
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:51.404
televisions that we grew up
with in the 605 and 705.

1164
00:56:51.404 --> 00:56:54.362
At some point the model will need
to change to reflect

1165
00:56:54.362 --> 00:56:56.320
the changing way people
are receiving their content.

1166
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.445
And do you think public service
broadcasting is possible

1167
00:56:58.445 --> 00:56:59.487
under a different model?

1168
00:56:59.487 --> 00:57:01.195
Does that even matter, do you think?

1169
00:57:01.195 --> 00:57:02.862
I personally think it does, yes.

1170
00:57:02.862 --> 00:57:05.570
I think there is an important
role for public service

1171
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:08.570
broadcasting and this
is where the difficulty comes.

1172
00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:12.487
How do you fund that
on a subscription only service?

1173
00:57:12.487 --> 00:57:15.570
These are complex and difficult
issues and that’s why nothing

1174
00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:19.279
is being done in a hurry and indeed,
nothing much will change until 2027,

1175
00:57:19.279 --> 00:57:22.362
which is when the licence fee model
continues to at the very least.

1176
00:57:22.362 --> 00:57:24.945
So what about the sabre rattling
coming from your government, then,

1177
00:57:24.945 --> 00:57:29.987
talking about the licence fee
being under threat?

1178
00:57:30.237 --> 00:57:33.112
Why do that if it’s not
in a hurry to change things?

1179
00:57:33.112 --> 00:57:35.987
Is itjust to exert a bit
of influence over the appointment

1180
00:57:35.987 --> 00:57:37.029
of the next director—general?

1181
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:38.695
I personally haven’t
seen any sabre rattling.

1182
00:57:38.695 --> 00:57:40.404
You haven’t seen any
sabre rattling?!

1183
00:57:40.404 --> 00:57:43.320
It’s all over the papers,
the front page of the Sunday Times!

1184
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.570
You should learn not to believe
everything you see in the papers.

1185
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.320
We know your background, the papers.

1186
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.445
I don’t believe everything
I read in the papers.

1187
00:57:50.445 --> 00:57:53.362
I never have.

1188
00:57:53.362 --> 00:57:56.612
Howard has referred to looking
at things over ten or 15 years.

1189
00:57:56.612 --> 00:58:00.904
And George hasjust said everything
is going to be the same until 2027.

1190
00:58:00.904 --> 00:58:04.529
I don’t think either one of you has
an idea of how quickly this picture

1191
00:58:04.529 --> 00:58:06.904
is changing and I’m deeply depressed
by both those answers.

1192
00:58:06.904 --> 00:58:11.070
I think the BBC may be in very
serious difficulty if we wait

1193
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:16.029
until 2027 before we decide
on a different model of how the BBC

1194
00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:19.279
can be carried forward,
notjust as a means for us to watch

1195
00:58:19.279 --> 00:58:23.362
television, but as a means of taking
the wonders of the BBC to the world,

1196
00:58:23.362 --> 00:58:26.404
which at the moment are not
available in a modern form,

1197
00:58:26.404 --> 00:58:29.070
that is to say they are not
available to the individual

1198
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.404
who wants to buy a BBC
programme at the moment

1199
00:58:31.404 --> 00:58:33.612
that he or she chooses
to watch it.

1200
00:58:33.612 --> 00:58:37.654
APPLAUSE.

1201
00:58:37.654 --> 00:58:40.820
We have very little time left,
but you have had your hand up

1202
00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:41.862
for quite some time.

1203
00:58:41.862 --> 00:58:43.779
You may end up having the last word.

1204
00:58:43.779 --> 00:58:45.945
I just think the BBC
is a national institution

1205
00:58:45.945 --> 00:58:47.362
that we are all proud of.

1206
00:58:47.362 --> 00:58:49.529
And I don’t think anybody
should be worrying about

1207
00:58:49.529 --> 00:58:50.570
paying that licence fee.

1208
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:51.570
It’s incredibly good value.

1209
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.445
What I think is the problem
is what are we spending that

1210
00:58:54.445 --> 00:58:56.612
money on, how much do
we pay our presenters...

1211
00:58:56.612 --> 00:58:58.529
And I’m not asking
this to you, Fiona!

1212
00:58:58.529 --> 00:59:02.945
If we are paying six and seven
figure salaries to TV presenters,

1213
00:59:02.945 --> 00:59:07.070
what does that actually say,
coming back to the lady’s first

1214
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.445
question of tonight,
the people that we value in this

1215
00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:12.154
country, the people that are doing
really hard jobs, day in,

1216
00:59:12.154 --> 00:59:15.237
day out, for a pittance,
and why is that money going to pay

1217
00:59:15.237 --> 00:59:18.154
people to do something here,
when I think anybody in the audience

1218
00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.487
could get up and present a programme
brilliantly as well.

1219
00:59:20.487 --> 00:59:22.362
I’m being controversial!

1220
00:59:22.362 --> 00:59:25.862
Fighting talk.

1221
00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.945
To me and Michael.

1222
00:59:27.945 --> 00:59:32.904
I’ll do it next week if you like.

1223
00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:35.070
0K, watch this space.

1224
00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.237
On that bombshell, I won’t be
sitting here again...

1225
00:59:37.237 --> 00:59:38.237
What’s your name?

1226
00:59:38.237 --> 00:59:39.279
Michael.
Michael.

1227
00:59:39.279 --> 00:59:40.945
Michael will be sitting
here next week.

1228
00:59:40.945 --> 00:59:41.987
Our hour is up.

1229
00:59:41.987 --> 00:59:43.029
Just as well.

1230
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:45.487
Next week we are in Middlesbrough
and the following week

1231
00:59:45.487 --> 00:59:47.612
we are in Tunbridge Wells in Kent.

1232
00:59:47.612 --> 00:59:50.029
Callus if you’d like
to be in the audience.

1233
00:59:50.029 --> 00:59:53.070
Or if you’d like to sit here,
who knows, or present

1234
00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.612
train programmes!

1235
00:59:55.612 --> 00:59:58.279
Or you can go to the Question Time
website and follow

1236
00:59:58.279 --> 00:59:59.404
the instructions there.

1237
00:59:59.404 --> 01:00:03.529
If you want to have your say
and continue the conversation

1238
01:00:03.529 --> 01:00:06.654
on tonight’s topics,
you can as always join Adrian Chiles

1239
01:00:06.654 --> 01:00:09.445
and guests on Question Time extra
time on 5 Live right now.

1240
01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:12.404
But for now, thank you very much
to the panel, to Michael,

1241
01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:14.695
to the audience here
and to you at home for

1242
01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:15.737
watching and listening.

1243
01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.570
From Weymouth.
Bye—bye.

1244
01:00:47.487 --> 01:00:50.779
Three men, armed with a pickaxe
and a baseball bat.

1245
01:00:50.779 --> 01:00:53.237
It looks like some
sort of hatchback...

1246
01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:56.112
I really thought the ceiling was
coming through.

1247
01:00:56.112 --> 01:00:58.695
What had this bloke found that he
deserved to die?

1248
01:00:58.695 --> 01:01:01.279
Who were those men? No comment.
The plot thickens...

1249
01:01:01.279 --> 01:01:03.404
It’s a lot bigger team
than we normally have.

1250
01:01:03.404 --> 01:01:04.945
It’s a massivejob, this one.

1251
01:01:04.945 --> 01:01:07.237
Take everything, full packs.
It’s Code One.

1252
01:01:07.237 --> 01:01:08.904
Police! What’s going on?!

1253
01:01:08.904 --> 01:01:11.154
True crime in real time.

1254
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:18.154
This is not our culture.

1255
01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:20.654
Some would argue
this is not any of our business.

1256
01:01:20.654 --> 01:01:22.404
People don’t like it when they see
blood.

1257
01:01:22.404 --> 01:01:23.820
It’s easy to go to the supermarket

1258
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.695
and buy beef without seeing
the slaughter.

1259
01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:27.820
These pilot whales
should just be left alone.

1260
01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.654
They don’t need to be slaughtered
forfood orfor tradition.

1261
01:01:37.154 --> 01:01:38.320
Whitney!

1262
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.237
Patrick!

1263
01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:41.529
Whitney!

1264
01:02:01.279 --> 01:02:04.154
Every year in the UK, thousands
of baby boys have an operation

1265
01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.195
where a small part of
their penis is removed

1266
01:02:06.195 --> 01:02:08.029
for religious and cultural reasons.

1267
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:11.279
Literally, when the child is born,
eight days later, you circumcise it

1268
01:02:11.279 --> 01:02:13.654
and it’s like a sort of
handing on the tradition.

1269
01:02:13.654 --> 01:02:15.820
It’s always been done
in the community.

1270
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.362
Therefore it’s a tradition
that continues.

1271
01:02:18.362 --> 01:02:20.445
Male circumcision is one
of the most common

1272
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.237
surgical procedures in the world —

1273
01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:25.945
but in Britain it’s also becoming
one of the most controversial.

1274
01:02:25.945 --> 01:02:29.404
I think it’s unspeakably not OK
to do that to a baby.

1275
01:02:29.404 --> 01:02:31.112
It was done badly.

1276
01:02:31.112 --> 01:02:34.112
I’ve had to see plastic surgeons
to try and sort it out.

1277
01:02:34.112 --> 01:02:38.445
Its opponents say it is unnecessary
and can cause children to suffer.

1278
01:02:38.445 --> 01:02:42.362
The case against mutilating
children’s genitals

1279
01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:44.362
is just overwhelming.

1280
01:02:44.362 --> 01:02:46.945
But for the parents who do it,
it’s an act of faith.

1281
01:02:46.945 --> 01:02:48.820
This is what we did
for our older boy

1282
01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.779
and we’re completely happy with it.

1283
01:02:50.779 --> 01:02:53.070
It’s what we’ve always done.

1284
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.070
I’ve been circumcised.
I didn’t have a choice.

1285
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.695
Was that wrong?
Should we keep circumcising people?

1286
01:02:58.695 --> 01:03:02.529
I’m Adnan Sarwar. I’m a journalist,
I’m from a Muslim background,

1287
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.945
and I was circumcised as an infant.

1288
01:03:04.945 --> 01:03:08.362
With several European countries
debating a ban on the practice,

1289
01:03:08.362 --> 01:03:12.904
I want to find out, is it something
we should consider banning here?

1290
01:03:20.154 --> 01:03:21.820
I’m beginning myjourney

1291
01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.820
at an Islamic circumcision centre
in London.

1292
01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.404
I’ve never witnessed
a circumcision before,

1293
01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:29.820
so I’m here see one
with my own eyes.

1294
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.237
I grew up as a Muslim
and I was circumcised,

1295
01:03:33.237 --> 01:03:34.737
and this is exactly the kind
of thing

1296
01:03:34.737 --> 01:03:36.154
that would have happened to me.

1297
01:03:36.154 --> 01:03:39.362
Imagine getting to see what happened
to you when you were born.

1298
01:03:39.362 --> 01:03:42.237
This service is based
in the East London Mosque,

1299
01:03:42.237 --> 01:03:45.029
where around 80% of their clients
are Muslims —

1300
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:48.279
but anyone can come here
for the operation.

1301
01:03:48.279 --> 01:03:52.195
It’s run by a consultant surgeon,
Dr Mohammad Howlader.

1302
01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:56.195
He’s a Muslim and he has run
this centre since 2014.

1303
01:03:56.195 --> 01:04:00.070
It carries out thousands
of circumcisions every year.

1304
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:03.237
Hello, Adnan. How are you doing?
Mohammad, how are you doing?

1305
01:04:03.237 --> 01:04:05.195
Good to meet you.
Good to see you as well.

1306
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.112
So why did you start doing it?

1307
01:04:08.112 --> 01:04:10.820
I used to see lots of people
who’d come in with complications,

1308
01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.945
not done in a regulated way,
not by the experienced people.

1309
01:04:13.945 --> 01:04:16.987
So I thought if I can provide
a better service for the community

1310
01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:19.529
and the people,
better for the children,

1311
01:04:19.529 --> 01:04:21.737
that was the incentive for me
to come into the practice.

1312
01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:24.612
What is circumcision?

1313
01:04:24.612 --> 01:04:29.279
Circumcision is the...is essentially
taking the foreskin

1314
01:04:29.279 --> 01:04:33.279
which covers the glans, the head,
to take that off.

1315
01:04:33.279 --> 01:04:36.737
We trim it off so that
it looks better looking

1316
01:04:36.737 --> 01:04:40.695
and easy to take care of,
look after it after the procedure.

1317
01:04:40.695 --> 01:04:42.404
Does the baby feel pain at all?

1318
01:04:42.404 --> 01:04:45.820
It’s only from 10—second
injection pain, that’s it.

1319
01:04:46.945 --> 01:04:49.070
You can’t get circumcised on the NHS

1320
01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:51.445
in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.

1321
01:04:51.445 --> 01:04:55.029
50 parents here have to pay
£120 for the procedure.

1322
01:04:56.654 --> 01:04:59.112
How are you feeling as a dad,
and how are you feeling as a mum,

1323
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:00.237
bringing your kid here?

1324
01:05:00.237 --> 01:05:05.154
It is the bit stressful, but the
cutting—up bit itself is pain—free.

1325
01:05:05.154 --> 01:05:07.362
This is what the doctor said.

1326
01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:11.945
It’s our religious custom and this
is what we did for our older boy.

1327
01:05:11.945 --> 01:05:14.279
0K.
And we’re completely happy with it.

1328
01:05:14.279 --> 01:05:16.862
Naturally, there is concern. Yeah.
