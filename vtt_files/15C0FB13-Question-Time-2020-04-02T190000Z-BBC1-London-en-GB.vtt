160
00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:37.157
Birmingham but I also work part-time
at my [oral

161
00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:38.741
Birmingham but I also work part—time
at my local supermarket. During my

162
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:39.282
at my [oral supermarket. During my
shifts I

163
00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:40.782
at my local supermarket. During my
shifts I encounter quite a lot of

164
00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:42.991
shifts I encounter quite a lot of
customers, and therefore I am

165
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:44.282
customers, and therefore I am
wondering why Germany has mustered

166
00:07:44.282 --> 00:07:46.116
wondering why Germany has mustered
over half a million tests per week,

167
00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:49.116
over half a million tests per week,
whereas we have only managed

168
00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:49.449
whereas we have only managed
5000-8000 per

169
00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:50.366
whereas we have only managed
5000—8000 per day. Why does the

170
00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:50.866
5000-8000 per day. why does the
panel think

171
00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:52.991
5000—8000 per day. Why does the
panel think this has happened? You

172
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:54.657
panel think this has happened? You
were talking about this in the press

173
00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:55.824
were talking about this in the press
conference earlier on today, why

174
00:07:55.824 --> 00:07:56.282
conference eartier on today, why
have we

175
00:07:56.282 --> 00:08:00.699
conference earlier on today, why
have we lagged behind? Well, we’ve

176
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.907
have we lagged behind? Well, we’ve
got one of the biggest testing

177
00:08:02.907 --> 00:08:05.616
got one of the biggest testing
programs in Europe, but there are

178
00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:07.241
programs in Europe, but there are
places like Germany where they have

179
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:10.241
places like Germany where they have
been able to do more tests, because

180
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:13.907
been able to do more tests, because
they started with a huge diagnostics

181
00:08:13.907 --> 00:08:14.449
they started with a huge diagnostic
industry,

182
00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:14.866
they started with a huge diagnostics
industry, which is

183
00:08:14.866 --> 00:08:15.407
they started with a huge diagnostics
industry, which isjust not

184
00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:15.949
they started with a huge diagnostics
industry, which is just not the

185
00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:18.449
industry, which is just not the
thing that we’ve had traditionally

186
00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.282
thing that we’ve had traditionally
as a country. They’ve been the

187
00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:21.866
as a country. Therve been the
European

188
00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:22.949
as a country. They’ve been the
European centre of diagnostics,

189
00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:25.157
European centre of diagnostics,
started with over 100 labs in

190
00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:27.949
started with over 100 labs in
Germany. But none of that takes away

191
00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:28.824
Germany. But none of that takes away
from the absolutely accurate point,

192
00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:31.241
from the absolutely accurate point,
which is that we want more testing.

193
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.907
which is that we want more testing.
I understand why people want the

194
00:08:32.907 --> 00:08:35.074
I understand why people want the
certainty that you get from having a

195
00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:39.407
certainty that you get from having a
test. So, we’re ramping up testing,

196
00:08:39.407 --> 00:08:41.491
test. So, we’re ramping up testing,
we’ve hit the goal of having 10,000

197
00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:44.699
we’ve hit the goal of having 10,000
tests a day by the end of March, and

198
00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:47.157
tests a day by the end of March, and
today, I’ve set the goal of 100,000

199
00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:48.699
today, I’ve set the goal of 100,000
tests a day by the end of this

200
00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:52.116
tests a day by the end of this
month. And to do that... Can I

201
00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:52.366
tests a day by the end of this
month. And to do that... Can Ijust

202
00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:52.907
month. And to do that... (“an Ijust
be clear,

203
00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.282
month. And to do that... Can Ijust
be clear, because I did not quite

204
00:08:54.282 --> 00:08:55.491
be clear, because I did not quite
understand it in the press

205
00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:56.949
understand it in the press
conference, because there was a talk

206
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:59.241
conference, because there was a talk
of 25,000 by the end of the month,

207
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:01.116
of 25,000 by the end of the month,
and 100,000 by the end of the month,

208
00:09:01.116 --> 00:09:03.907
and 100,000 by the end of the month,
which is it? 100,000 by the end of

209
00:09:03.907 --> 00:09:07.991
which is it? 100,000 by the end of
the month. The goal was 25,000, and

210
00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:11.032
the month. The goal was 25,000, and
by pulling together out of

211
00:09:11.032 --> 00:09:13.449
by pulling together out of
international effort, I think we can

212
00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:13.866
international effort, I think we ran
get to

213
00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:15.074
international effort, I think we can
get to 100,000. 50 that is the goal

214
00:09:15.074 --> 00:09:15.616
get to 100,000. So that is the goal
I have set

215
00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:19.699
get to 100,000. 50 that is the goal
I have set today. And the whole

216
00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:21.407
I have set today. And the whole
pharmaceutical industry is going to

217
00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:23.032
pharmaceutical industry is going to
have to help and play its part, in

218
00:09:23.032 --> 00:09:26.949
have to help and play its part, in
the same way that we’ve got expert

219
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:28.407
the same way that we’ve got expert
manufacturers who have never

220
00:09:28.407 --> 00:09:30.866
manufacturers who have never
manufactured a ventilator before now

221
00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:32.157
manufactured a ventilator before now
manufacturing ventilators, the

222
00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:32.824
manufacturing ventilators, the
pharmaceutical industry, that

223
00:09:32.824 --> 00:09:34.741
pharmaceutical industry, that
normally deals in other types of

224
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.241
normally deals in other types of
drugs, like vaccines and what have

225
00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:38.491
drugs, like vaccines and what have
7°“-

226
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.616
drugs, like vaccines and what have
you, they are joining this

227
00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:39.907
drugs, like vaccines and what have
you, they arejoining this national

228
00:09:39.907 --> 00:09:42.574
you, they arejoining this national
effort to get enough testing. 50, we

229
00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:43.074
effort to get enough testing. So, we
do test

230
00:09:43.074 --> 00:09:44.949
effort to get enough testing. 50, we
do test more, we’ve tested more than

231
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:46.699
do test more, we’ve tested more than
France, the Netherlands, lots of

232
00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:46.991
France, the Nethertands, lots of
other

233
00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:47.782
France, the Netherlands, lots of
other similar countries, but there

234
00:09:47.782 --> 00:09:49.157
other similar countries, but there
are countries like Germany that are

235
00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:53.032
are countries like Germany that are
ahead of us, and I think that we’ve

236
00:09:53.032 --> 00:09:54.282
ahead of us, and I think that we’ve
got to increase the amount of

237
00:09:54.282 --> 00:09:57.532
got to increase the amount of
testing. And that’s important so

238
00:09:57.532 --> 00:09:59.949
testing. And that’s important so
that is what we are going to have to

239
00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:02.407
that is what we are going to have to
do. To be clear, the aim is 100,000

240
00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:05.407
do. To be clear, the aim is 100,000
by the end of this month, to test if

241
00:10:05.407 --> 00:10:05.866
by the end of this month, to test if
peopla have

242
00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:07.741
by the end of this month, to test if
people have coronavirus, not if they

243
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:08.657
peopla have coronavims, not if they
have had it, if

244
00:10:08.657 --> 00:10:09.241
people have coronavirus, not if they
have had it, if they actually have

245
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.574
have had it, if they actually have
it at the time of taking the test?

246
00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:14.949
it at the time of taking the test?
It is 100,000 tests overall. Both

247
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:19.032
It is 100,000 tests overall. Both
types of test? Exactly, on all the

248
00:10:19.032 --> 00:10:21.907
types of test? Exactly, on all the
different strands of testing policy.

249
00:10:21.907 --> 00:10:23.491
different strands of testing policy.
We have five different strengths.

250
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:25.324
We have five different strengths.
Essentially, there are two types, as

251
00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:25.866
Essentially, there are two types, as
you

252
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:26.157
Fssentially, there are two types, as
you 5“-

253
00:10:26.157 --> 00:10:27.116
Essentially, there are two types, as
you say, there is either the swab

254
00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:29.157
you say, there is either the swab
test to see if you have got it or a

255
00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:30.907
test to see if you have got it or a
blood test to see if you have had

256
00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:35.907
blood test to see if you have had
it. But the latter, the science

257
00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:37.907
it. But the latter, the science
isn’t yet developed enough for those

258
00:10:37.907 --> 00:10:41.449
isn’t yet developed enough for those
tests to be in large scale good

259
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:43.282
tests to be in large scale good
enough not to give false results,

260
00:10:43.282 --> 00:10:44.949
enough not to give false results,
which is worse than having no test

261
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:46.199
which is worse than having no test
at all, because it gives false

262
00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:50.907
at all, because it gives false
comfort. So, just to be clear, the

263
00:10:50.907 --> 00:10:52.532
comfort. So, just to be clear, the
25,000 is to see if people have the

264
00:10:52.532 --> 00:10:53.991
25,000 is to see if peopla have the
symptoms? If

265
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:55.574
25,000 is to see if people have the
symptoms? If people actually have

266
00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:57.616
symptoms? If peopla actually have
it? That

267
00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:58.866
symptoms? If people actually have
it? That was the old goal. The

268
00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.491
it? That was the old goal. The
policy is really clear. It is that

269
00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:02.157
policy is really clear. It is that
by the end of this month, we are

270
00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:06.282
by the end of this month, we are
going to have 100,000 tests per day.

271
00:11:06.282 --> 00:11:08.157
going to have 100,000 tests per day.
That is what we need to do as a

272
00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:11.949
That is what we need to do as a
country. To test if people have got

273
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:13.866
country. To test if people have got
coronavirus and if they have had it?

274
00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:14.241
coronavirus and if they have had it?
The whola

275
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:17.407
coronavirus and if they have had it?
The whole lot. Both types of tests.

276
00:11:17.407 --> 00:11:22.824
The whole lot. Both types of tests.
Yvette? I strongly welcome the

277
00:11:22.824 --> 00:11:25.324
Yvette? I strongly welcome the
measures announced by Matt today,

278
00:11:25.324 --> 00:11:26.949
measures announced by Matt today,
the commitment to broadening the

279
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:28.241
the commitment to broadening the
number of organisations that are

280
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:30.282
number of organisations that are
involved in doing the testing, the

281
00:11:30.282 --> 00:11:31.366
involved in doing the testing, the
universities, the private sector,

282
00:11:31.366 --> 00:11:33.199
universities, the private sector,
the charitable sector, all of that,

283
00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:34.324
the charitabla sector, all of that,
I think it

284
00:11:34.324 --> 00:11:35.741
the charitable sector, all of that,
I think it is really good and really

285
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:38.116
I think it is really good and really
important. If we’re honest, this has

286
00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:39.782
important. If we’re honest, this has
been hugely frustrating, the whole

287
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:40.241
been hugely fmstrating, the whole
process up

288
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:41.407
been hugely frustrating, the whole
process up to now and the confusion

289
00:11:41.407 --> 00:11:44.324
process up to now and the confusion
about the testing, but actually to

290
00:11:44.324 --> 00:11:45.824
about the testing, but actually to
have that commitment to broaden it

291
00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:48.282
have that commitment to broaden it
out is really welcome because I

292
00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:50.074
out is really welcome because I
think the centralised approach and

293
00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:51.032
think the centralised approach and
just using Public Health England,

294
00:11:51.032 --> 00:11:51.199
just using Public Health England,
therre

295
00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:51.782
just using Public Health England,
they’re doing a great

296
00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:52.574
just using Public Health England,
they’re doing a greatjob but it is

297
00:11:52.574 --> 00:11:53.366
therre doing a great job but it is
just not

298
00:11:53.366 --> 00:11:55.116
they’re doing a greatjob but it is
just not enough to do the scale of

299
00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:56.449
just not enough to do the scale of
the tests that we could clearly

300
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:57.366
the tests that we could dearty
need.

301
00:11:57.366 --> 00:11:59.449
the tests that we could clearly
need. But I still have, look, there

302
00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:01.199
need. But I still have, look, there
are questions about how and why we

303
00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:03.741
are questions about how and why we
got to hear and so on, but putting

304
00:12:03.741 --> 00:12:05.366
got to hear and so on, but putting
those aside, because the important

305
00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:08.324
those aside, because the important
thing is where we go now — I still

306
00:12:08.324 --> 00:12:08.866
thing is where we go now - I still
have a big

307
00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:09.449
thing is where we go now — I still
have a big question about the

308
00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:11.407
have a big question about the
overall objective with this, and how

309
00:12:11.407 --> 00:12:14.116
overall objective with this, and how
this testing fits into the wider

310
00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:15.991
this testing fits into the wider
strategy. Because I’m not sure what

311
00:12:15.991 --> 00:12:19.032
strategy. Because I’m not sure what
your plan is around the community

312
00:12:19.032 --> 00:12:21.074
your plan is around the community
testing, is the community testing

313
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.741
testing, is the community testing
just going to be the antibodies, the

314
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:26.907
just going to be the antibodies, the
have you had it, are you now immune?

315
00:12:26.907 --> 00:12:28.491
have you had it, are you now immune?
And is it an immunity test for the

316
00:12:28.491 --> 00:12:31.824
And is it an immunity test for the
community? Or is the community

317
00:12:31.824 --> 00:12:34.199
community? Or is the community
testing strategy about whether

318
00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:34.324
testing strategy about whether
peopla

319
00:12:34.324 --> 00:12:35.407
testing strategy about whether
people are infectious, the Count of

320
00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:35.616
peopla are infectious, the Count of
South

321
00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:37.449
people are infectious, the Count of
South Korea strategy, testing

322
00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:41.116
South Korea strategy, testing
people, tracing the contacts and so

323
00:12:41.116 --> 00:12:41.574
peoplc, tracing the contacts and so
on, which

324
00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:45.157
people, tracing the contacts and so
on, which the WA WHO has always

325
00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:45.241
on, which the WA WHO has always
rallad

326
00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:46.907
on, which the WA WHO has always
called for? There has been this

327
00:12:46.907 --> 00:12:48.407
called for? There has been this
debate in Britain about really

328
00:12:48.407 --> 00:12:50.407
debate in Britain about really
whether the Govan strategy was

329
00:12:50.407 --> 00:12:50.907
whether the Govan strategy was
immunity, or

330
00:12:50.907 --> 00:12:51.074
whether the Govan strategy was
immunity, orwhether

331
00:12:51.074 --> 00:12:52.032
whether the Govan strategy was
immunity, or whether it was a

332
00:12:52.032 --> 00:12:54.074
immunity, or whether it was a
suppression, and it has never really

333
00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.866
suppression, and it has never really
been clear to us, and I am still not

334
00:12:55.866 --> 00:12:58.407
been clear to us, and I am still not
clear with this testing strategy

335
00:12:58.407 --> 00:12:59.866
clear with this testing strategy
whether you are pursuing immunity,

336
00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:01.741
whether you are pursuing immunity,
or whether you’re pursuing

337
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:02.616
or whether you’re pursuing
suppression, as the ultimate

338
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:06.449
suppression, as the ultimate
objective. To be really clear, we

339
00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:09.241
objective. To be really clear, we
are bending the curve down, so if

340
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:10.699
are bending the curve down, so if
you like, all it

341
00:13:10.699 --> 00:13:11.866
are bending the curve down, so if
you like, cell it what you will, it

342
00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:12.241
you like, all it what you will, it
is about

343
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.407
you like, cell it what you will, it
is about getting the curve of the

344
00:13:14.407 --> 00:13:17.574
is about getting the curve of the
virus down, to slow the spread. It

345
00:13:17.574 --> 00:13:20.116
virus down, to slow the spread. It
is not about trying to achieve

346
00:13:20.116 --> 00:13:21.657
is not about trying to achieve
immunity of the whole population.

347
00:13:21.657 --> 00:13:21.866
immunity of the whola population.
It’s

348
00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:24.449
immunity of the whole population.
It’s about trying to get the curve

349
00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.657
It’s about trying to get the curve
down and to protect lives. And to do

350
00:13:26.657 --> 00:13:29.407
down and to protect lives. And to do
that, you need both types of test,

351
00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:30.949
that, you need both types of test,
exactly as you say. You need both

352
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:33.324
exactly as you say. You need both
the tests to test if people have had

353
00:13:33.324 --> 00:13:33.782
the tests to test if peopla have had
it, and

354
00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:35.949
the tests to test if people have had
it, and therefore they are likely to

355
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.866
it, and therefore they are likely to
be immune, like hopefully I am. But

356
00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:41.491
be immune, like hopefully I am. But
to get lots of those, people keep

357
00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:43.366
to get lots of those, people keep
trying to sell me these tests,

358
00:13:43.366 --> 00:13:43.657
trying to sell me these tests,
PNQMNCY

359
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:45.282
trying to sell me these tests,
pregnancy type tests, we keep

360
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:46.741
pregnancy type tests, we keep
checking whether they work, and so

361
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:50.241
checking whether they work, and so
far we haven’t found one that works.

362
00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:51.366
far we haven’t found one that works.
And then also ramping up the

363
00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:55.657
And then also ramping up the
so—called swab test, up your nose,

364
00:13:55.657 --> 00:13:56.157
so-ralled swab test, up your nose,
to find out

365
00:13:56.157 --> 00:13:56.407
so—called swab test, up your nose,
to find out if

366
00:13:56.407 --> 00:13:56.616
so-ralled swab test, up your nose,
to find out if you

367
00:13:56.616 --> 00:13:57.074
so—called swab test, up your nose,
to find out if you currently have

368
00:13:57.074 --> 00:13:58.574
to find out if you currently have
the vims.

369
00:13:58.574 --> 00:13:59.574
to find out if you currently have
the virus. Both of those are very

370
00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:03.407
the vims. Both of those are very
important. So,

371
00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:04.657
the virus. Both of those are very
important. 50, the community testing

372
00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:05.032
important. So, the community testing
of the

373
00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:05.824
important. 50, the community testing
of the current

374
00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:06.449
important. So, the community testing
of the current infection, are you

375
00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:08.241
of the current infection, are you
planning to increase the tracing and

376
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:10.824
planning to increase the tracing and
so on as well? I understand,

377
00:14:10.824 --> 00:14:11.074
so on as well? I understand,
ﬂattening

378
00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:11.907
so on as well? I understand,
flattening the curve, absolutely

379
00:14:11.907 --> 00:14:12.074
ﬂattening the curve, absolutely
right,

380
00:14:12.074 --> 00:14:14.241
flattening the curve, absolutely
right, everybody wants to make sure

381
00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:17.491
right, everybody wants to make sure
that the NHS can cope, and they are

382
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:17.616
that the NHS ran cope, and they are
the

383
00:14:17.616 --> 00:14:19.032
that the NHS can cope, and they are
the heroes dealing with this at the

384
00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:20.907
the heroes dealing with this at the
moment. But in terms of how we come

385
00:14:20.907 --> 00:14:24.366
moment. But in terms of how we come
out of the lockdown, how we come

386
00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:26.366
out of the lockdown, how we come
through this, is it by getting more

387
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:26.824
through this, is it by getting more
peopla to

388
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.491
through this, is it by getting more
people to have had it, which seems

389
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:30.074
peopla to have had it, which seems
to be --

390
00:14:30.074 --> 00:14:31.741
people to have had it, which seems
to be —— seem to be the government

391
00:14:31.741 --> 00:14:32.282
to be -- seem to be the government
strategy at the

392
00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:32.949
to be —— seem to be the government
strategy at the beginning, which was

393
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:35.074
strategy at the beginning, which was
worrying, or is it that we get to a

394
00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.241
worrying, or is it that we get to a
point where we can do proper

395
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:37.407
point where we ran do proper
community

396
00:14:37.407 --> 00:14:38.366
point where we can do proper
community testing and tracing? And

397
00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:40.532
community testing and tracing? And
if it’s the second, which I hope it

398
00:14:40.532 --> 00:14:45.282
if it’s the second, which I hope it
is, that’s great... I don’t even

399
00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:47.074
is, that’s great... I don’t even
need to be here! These are the

400
00:14:47.074 --> 00:14:49.032
need to be here! These are the
questions I wanted to get answered.

401
00:14:49.032 --> 00:14:51.949
questions I wanted to get answered.
If you get that level of community

402
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:53.074
If you get that level of community
testing and tracing for infection,

403
00:14:53.074 --> 00:14:56.116
testing and tracing for infection,
don’t you need to go way, way beyond

404
00:14:56.116 --> 00:14:57.866
don’t you need to go way, way beyond
the 100,000 that you’re talking

405
00:14:57.866 --> 00:14:59.616
the 100,000 that you’re talking
about at the moment? Shouldn’t we be

406
00:14:59.616 --> 00:15:01.116
about at the moment? Shouldn’t we be
setting a much bigger objective even

407
00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:03.699
setting a much bigger objective even
if we can’t get there in a month?

408
00:15:03.699 --> 00:15:06.532
if we can’t get there in a month?
Yes, we have a goal of 250,000 but I

409
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:08.324
Yes, we have a goal of250,000 but I
wanted to put a

410
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.199
Yes, we have a goal of 250,000 but I
wanted to put a timeframe on it and

411
00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:12.032
wanted to put a timeframe on it and
I wanted to say to my team, to the

412
00:15:12.032 --> 00:15:12.324
I wanted to sayto my team, to the
team at

413
00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:13.366
I wanted to say to my team, to the
team at Public Health England, who

414
00:15:13.366 --> 00:15:15.949
team at Public Health England, who
have been brilliant on this, to the

415
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.282
have been brilliant on this, to the
NHS and to the life sciences

416
00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:19.324
NHS and to the life sciences
industry and the companies involved,

417
00:15:19.324 --> 00:15:21.991
industry and the companies involved,
and the charities, all the rest of

418
00:15:21.991 --> 00:15:23.199
and the charities, all the rest of
them, this is our collective goal,

419
00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:24.991
them, this is our collactive goal,
put a date on it,

420
00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:25.741
them, this is our collective goal,
put a date on it, put a number on

421
00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:26.282
put a date on it, put a number on
it. I

422
00:15:26.282 --> 00:15:26.574
put a date on it, put a number on
it. lam

423
00:15:26.574 --> 00:15:27.824
put a date on it, put a number on
it. I am the one who has put that

424
00:15:27.824 --> 00:15:28.491
it. I am the one who has put that
meat, I have

425
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:28.657
it. I am the one who has put that
meet, I have said

426
00:15:28.657 --> 00:15:29.699
it. I am the one who has put that
meat, I have said that this is our

427
00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:33.324
meat, I have said that this is our
goal and we have now got to make it

428
00:15:33.324 --> 00:15:35.491
goal and we have now got to make it
happen. And there is one further

429
00:15:35.491 --> 00:15:37.116
happen. And there is one further
really important point in this,

430
00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:42.657
really important point in this,
which is that of course, getting to

431
00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:44.407
which is that of course, getting to
broad community testing is important

432
00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:46.657
broad community testing is important
and is the goal, but we have to

433
00:15:46.657 --> 00:15:48.491
and is the goal, but we have to
prioritise the tests that we’ve got,

434
00:15:48.491 --> 00:15:49.657
prioritise the tests that we’ve got,
starting with the patient for whom

435
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.991
starting with the patient for whom
it could be a life or death matter,

436
00:15:51.991 --> 00:15:55.866
it could be a life or death matter,
then the critical NHS staff, then

437
00:15:55.866 --> 00:15:57.074
then the critical NHS staff, then
key workers, and once we’ve got

438
00:15:57.074 --> 00:16:00.407
key workers, and once we’ve got
enough tests for all of them, we can

439
00:16:00.407 --> 00:16:01.241
enough tests for all of them, we ran
then get to the

440
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:03.241
enough tests for all of them, we can
then get to the community. On that

441
00:16:03.241 --> 00:16:06.407
then get to the community. On that
point, Donna... It is important to

442
00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:06.616
point, Donna... It is importantto
remember

443
00:16:06.616 --> 00:16:09.407
point, Donna... It is important to
remember that people coming into the

444
00:16:09.407 --> 00:16:11.491
remember that people coming into the
hospital, come in from the

445
00:16:11.491 --> 00:16:13.866
hospital, come in from the
community. So, there is Covid—19 in

446
00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:14.241
community. So, there is Covid-19 in
the community.

447
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.574
community. So, there is Covid—19 in
the community. So, we do have to

448
00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.449
the community. So, we do have to
test the community, because it’s not

449
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:19.074
test the community, because it’s not
just existing in hospital. If you

450
00:16:19.074 --> 00:16:22.866
just existing in hospital. If you
look across, many of the people that

451
00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:23.949
look across, many of the peoplo that
are getting

452
00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.116
look across, many of the people that
are getting Covid—19 are in the

453
00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:25.282
are getting Covid-19 are in the
community.

454
00:16:25.282 --> 00:16:26.699
are getting Covid—19 are in the
community. One thing you and I know

455
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:28.657
community. One thing you and I know
is that it is important, if your

456
00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:30.782
is that it is important, if your
child has got a cough or you have

457
00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.699
child has got a cough or you have
got a cough, that you understand

458
00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:34.116
got a cough, that you understand
what it is, because neither do you

459
00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:36.241
what it is, because neither do you
want to be a spreader, neither do

460
00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:38.991
want to be a spreader, neither do
you want to self—isolate for M

461
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:39.366
you want to self-isolate for 14
days, unless

462
00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.449
you want to self—isolate for M
days, unless you know that you’ve

463
00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:41.991
days, unless you know that you’ve
got it. So it’s hugely important and

464
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:44.491
got it. So it’s hugely important and
we are going to have to ramp up the

465
00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:46.366
we are going to have to ramp up the
tests across the community. We have

466
00:16:46.366 --> 00:16:47.699
tests across the community. We have
focused on the hospitals because we

467
00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:49.907
focused on the hospitals because we
know it is a place where it is

468
00:16:49.907 --> 00:16:51.824
know it is a place where it is
spreading, but equally, we know that

469
00:16:51.824 --> 00:16:53.824
spreading, but equally, we know that
one in ten healthcare workers are

470
00:16:53.824 --> 00:16:54.282
one in ten healthrare workers are
also peopla

471
00:16:54.282 --> 00:16:55.949
one in ten healthcare workers are
also people that are spreading the

472
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:56.407
also peopla that are spreading the
virus, so

473
00:16:56.407 --> 00:16:57.866
also people that are spreading the
virus, so we need the tests both in

474
00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:02.282
virus, so we need the tests both in
the community and in hospitals. I

475
00:17:02.282 --> 00:17:04.616
the community and in hospitals. I
noticed that Matt, you would not

476
00:17:04.616 --> 00:17:06.866
noticed that Matt, you would not
commit to saying when health workers

477
00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:08.449
commit to saying when health workers
would get the coronavirus test that

478
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:10.449
would get the coronavirus test that
they require, as many as they felt

479
00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:12.074
they require, as many as they felt
they needed in order to be able to

480
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:13.532
they needed in order to be able to
see if they have got symptoms,

481
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.782
see if they have got symptoms,
whether they can come back to work,

482
00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:16.407
whether they ran come back to work,
what is your

483
00:17:16.407 --> 00:17:16.991
whether they can come back to work,
what is your feeling about that,

484
00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:19.574
what is your feeling about that,
Donna? Well, we have to get it,

485
00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.824
Donna? Well, we have to get it,
because if we don’t, we want to be

486
00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:23.574
because if we don’t, we want to be
able to work. We know that although

487
00:17:23.574 --> 00:17:25.157
able to work. We know that although
the figures are getting better from

488
00:17:25.157 --> 00:17:26.991
the figures are getting better from
this evening’s press conference, we

489
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:29.991
this evening’s press conference, we
know that at anyone time, between

490
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:30.616
know that at anyone time, between
25%

491
00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:30.866
know that at anyone time, between
2596 and

492
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.241
know that at anyone time, between
25% and 40% of our healthcare

493
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:34.324
25% and 40% of our healthcare
workers are self—isolating. How does

494
00:17:34.324 --> 00:17:34.907
workers are self-isolating. How does
that tally with

495
00:17:34.907 --> 00:17:35.699
workers are self—isolating. How does
that tally with the figure that you

496
00:17:35.699 --> 00:17:41.449
that tally with the figure that you
gave at the press conference?

497
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:42.074
gave at the press conference? 5.7%

498
00:17:42.074 --> 00:17:42.324
gave at the press conference? 5.796
of

499
00:17:42.324 --> 00:17:45.032
gave at the press conference? 5.7%
of doctors. And 8% of all NHS staff.

500
00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:45.366
of doctors. And 896 of all NHS staff.
On Monday

501
00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.907
of doctors. And 8% of all NHS staff.
On Monday we were told that it was

502
00:17:47.907 --> 00:17:48.991
On Monday we were told that it was
2511. Yet,

503
00:17:48.991 --> 00:17:50.616
On Monday we were told that it was
25%. Yet, but that survey was not an

504
00:17:50.616 --> 00:17:51.282
2596. Yet, but that survey was not an
accurate survey.

505
00:17:51.282 --> 00:17:52.824
25%. Yet, but that survey was not an
accurate survey. And so I wanted to

506
00:17:52.824 --> 00:17:54.324
accurate survey. And so I wanted to
get that figure and explain it to

507
00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:58.866
get that figure and explain it to
the public. Because 8% is much lower

508
00:17:58.866 --> 00:17:59.491
the public. Because 896 is much lower
than peopla

509
00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:00.116
the public. Because 8% is much lower
than people had previously reported,

510
00:18:00.116 --> 00:18:02.491
than people had previously reported,
but it is still a high figure, and

511
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:04.866
but it is still a high figure, and
this is why Donna is completely

512
00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.616
this is why Donna is completely
right about the need for the testing

513
00:18:06.616 --> 00:18:10.449
right about the need for the testing
within the NHS, and then once we’ve

514
00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:12.491
within the NHS, and then once we’ve
got to that, then we can keep the

515
00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:12.532
got to that, then we ran keep the
numbers

516
00:18:12.532 --> 00:18:15.741
got to that, then we can keep the
numbers going up and keep expanding.

517
00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:16.116
numbers going up and keep expanding.
john, I

518
00:18:16.116 --> 00:18:16.574
numbers going up and keep expanding.
john, Iwant

519

john, I want to

John, I want to come to you in a

00:18:17.907 --> 00:18:18.324
john, I want to come to you in a
minute. I

00:18:18.324 --> 00:18:18.616
john, I want to come to you in a
minute. lam

523
00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:18.907
john, I want to come to you in a
minute. Iamjust

524
00:18:18.907 --> 00:18:20.241
John, I want to come to you in a
minute. I am just going to read out

525
00:18:20.241 --> 00:18:22.157
minute. I am just going to read out
some of the tweets and comments that

526
00:18:22.157 --> 00:18:24.616
some of the tweets and comments that
we are getting coming in. This one —

527
00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:25.241
we are getting coming in. This one -
would you agree

528
00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:26.491
we are getting coming in. This one —
would you agree that you were slow

529
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.907
would you agree that you were slow
off the mark? You knew that this was

530
00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.241
off the mark? You knew that this was
coming, and testing and ventilators

531
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:33.241
coming, and testing and ventilators
were requested at a late stage. This

532
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:35.407
were requested at a late stage. This
one... Isn’t it that we started on

533
00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:38.699
one... Isn’t it that we started on
the wrong track with heard immunity

534
00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:40.074
the wrong track with heard immunity
and then changed track? This meant

535
00:18:40.074 --> 00:18:42.449
and then changed track? This meant
we were at the back of the queue for

536
00:18:42.449 --> 00:18:46.866
we were at the back of the queue for
buying tests. This one... 100,000

537
00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.616
buying tests. This one... 100,000
tests per day right now, why can’t

538
00:18:48.616 --> 00:18:48.824
tests per day right now, why can’t
we.

539
00:18:48.824 --> 00:18:51.032
tests per day right now, why can’t
we, is it lack of money, lack of

540
00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:52.407
we, is it lack of money, lack of
testing kits? What is your view on

541
00:18:52.407 --> 00:18:52.949
testing kits? what is your view on
all of this,

542
00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:56.407
testing kits? What is your view on
all of this, John? First of all, I

543
00:18:56.407 --> 00:18:57.199
all of this, john? First of all, I
want to begin

544
00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:58.366
all of this, John? First of all, I
want to begin by praising the NHS

545
00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:00.657
want to begin by praising the NHS
staff, and in my book, they should

546
00:19:00.657 --> 00:19:02.282
staff, and in my book, they should
get the tests, they should be a

547
00:19:02.282 --> 00:19:05.574
get the tests, they should be a
priority, just like the patients.

548
00:19:05.574 --> 00:19:06.824
priority, just like the patients.
Because they are putting their lives

549
00:19:06.824 --> 00:19:12.657
Because they are putting their lives
in great danger and because of their

550
00:19:12.657 --> 00:19:13.157
in great danger and because of their
vocation, so

551
00:19:13.157 --> 00:19:13.324
in great danger and because of their
vocation, sol

552
00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:13.949
in great danger and because of their
vocation, so I would have thought

553
00:19:13.949 --> 00:19:15.366
vocation, so I would have thought
the priority should have been,

554
00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:18.991
the priority should have been,
really, the patient and all those

555
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.241
really, the patient and all those
who are on the front line, plus

556
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:23.907
who are on the front line, plus
those working in social care. I

557
00:19:23.907 --> 00:19:24.157
those working in social rare. I
think

558
00:19:24.157 --> 00:19:25.532
those working in social care. I
think the testing should happen. And

559
00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:28.491
think the testing should happen. And
in the end, I don’t think that the

560
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:29.157
in the end, I don’t think that the
government could have prepared

561
00:19:29.157 --> 00:19:34.282
government could have prepared
better. You can do your best, but

562
00:19:34.282 --> 00:19:34.782
better. You ran do your best, but
when it

563
00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:36.491
better. You can do your best, but
when it happens, it hits you pretty

564
00:19:36.491 --> 00:19:39.241
when it happens, it hits you pretty
hard. It’s almost like having an

565
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:41.116
hard. It’s almost like having an
earthquake, you can prepare as much

566
00:19:41.116 --> 00:19:41.824
earthquake, you ran prepare as much
as you like, but

567
00:19:41.824 --> 00:19:44.074
earthquake, you can prepare as much
as you like, but until it happens...

568
00:19:44.074 --> 00:19:45.657
as you like, but until it happens...
One thing the government hasn’t done

569
00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:47.991
One thing the government hasn’t done
is to do what Kitchener did — your

570
00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:48.366
is to do what Kitchener did - your
country needs

571
00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:51.699
is to do what Kitchener did — your
country needs you. And so, we have

572
00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:54.241
country needs you. And so, we have
galvanised, the industries,

573
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.199
galvanised, the industries,
everything, but we are coming to you

574
00:19:57.199 --> 00:19:59.991
everything, but we are coming to you
slightly late. When we had, for

575
00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:00.116
slightly late. when we had, for
example,

576
00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.574
slightly late. When we had, for
example, Formula 1, Mercedes—Benz,

577
00:20:01.574 --> 00:20:02.366
example, Formula 1, Mercedes-Benz,
saying they are

578
00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:03.699
example, Formula 1, Mercedes—Benz,
saying they are capable of producing

579
00:20:03.699 --> 00:20:04.491
saying they are capable of producing
breathing equipment, they can

580
00:20:04.491 --> 00:20:04.866
breathing equipment, they ran
produce a

581
00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:06.282
breathing equipment, they can
produce a thousand a day, there are

582
00:20:06.282 --> 00:20:10.574
produce a thousand a day, there are
many other companies that actually

583
00:20:10.574 --> 00:20:12.824
many other companies that actually
could, without relying on things

584
00:20:12.824 --> 00:20:15.241
could, without relying on things
coming from overseas. So you need

585
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:17.407
coming from overseas. So you need
now to galvanise all the industries

586
00:20:17.407 --> 00:20:18.699
now to galvanise all the industries
and all the scientists and everybody

587
00:20:18.699 --> 00:20:22.491
and all the scientists and everybody
else and say, we have a war with

588
00:20:22.491 --> 00:20:23.407
else and say, we have a war with
this invisible danger, and therefore

589
00:20:23.407 --> 00:20:26.407
this invisible danger, and therefore
we want you to do everything that

590
00:20:26.407 --> 00:20:26.949
we want you to do everything that
you ran, and

591
00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:28.199
we want you to do everything that
you can, and so, for the rest of us,

592
00:20:28.199 --> 00:20:29.241
you ran, and so, for the rest of us,
who are not on

593
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:30.282
you can, and so, for the rest of us,
who are not on the front line, we

594
00:20:30.282 --> 00:20:32.616
who are not on the front line, we
need to do exactly what you say —

595
00:20:32.616 --> 00:20:32.949
need to do exactly what you say -
staying at

596
00:20:32.949 --> 00:20:36.866
need to do exactly what you say —
staying at home, protecting the NHS

597
00:20:36.866 --> 00:20:38.324
staying at home, protecting the NHS
and children and saving lives. This

598
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:42.199
and children and saving lives. This
is what we can do. But collectively,

599
00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:42.616
is what we ran do. But collactively,
this country

600
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:43.366
is what we can do. But collectively,
this country could manufacture some

601
00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:45.741
this country could manufacture some
of that stuff pretty fast, pretty

602
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:47.032
of that stuff pretty fast, pretty
quickly, if all the industries were

603
00:20:47.032 --> 00:20:49.574
quickly, if all the industries were
invited to come to the table. 50 I

604
00:20:49.574 --> 00:20:50.241
invited to come to the tabla. So I
think you come

605
00:20:50.241 --> 00:20:51.949
invited to come to the table. 50 I
think you come to it a bit late, you

606
00:20:51.949 --> 00:20:53.824
think you come to it a bit late, you
should have really done it. For the

607
00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:55.949
should have really done it. For the
things we’ve done so far, I

608
00:20:55.949 --> 00:20:56.241
should have really done it. For the
things we’ve done so far, Ijust

609
00:20:56.241 --> 00:20:58.032
things we’ve done so far, Ijust
want to say some of them,

610
00:20:58.032 --> 00:20:59.366
want to say some of them,
particularly that you gave the

611
00:20:59.366 --> 00:21:03.741
particularly that you gave the
responsibility to science, you

612
00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:04.699
responsibility to science, you
didn’t ignore the scientists that

613
00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:11.907
didn’t ignore the scientists that
needed to come, and I think we would

614
00:21:11.907 --> 00:21:13.574
needed to come, and I think we would
have had already personal protection

615
00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:14.741
have had already personal protection
equipment much faster, because in

616
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.032
equipment much faster, because in
this country, there is things can be

617
00:21:17.032 --> 00:21:17.949
this country, there is things can be
manufactured very quickly and very

618
00:21:17.949 --> 00:21:23.324
manufactured very quickly and very
fast. And with the army, should have

619
00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.532
fast. And with the army, should have
found somebody who is good in

620
00:21:25.532 --> 00:21:26.324
found somebody who is good in
logistic, in a

621
00:21:26.324 --> 00:21:26.657
found somebody who is good in
logistics, in a battle, to

622
00:21:26.657 --> 00:21:29.574
logistics, in a battle, to
distribute things, to be in charge

623
00:21:29.574 --> 00:21:30.407
distribute things, to be in charge
of it and not

624
00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:30.574
distribute things, to be in charge
of it and notjust

625
00:21:30.574 --> 00:21:30.866
distribute things, to be in charge
of it and not just the

626
00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:32.199
distribute things, to be in charge
of it and notjust the health

627
00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:33.324
of it and notjust the health
professionals, because their role is

628
00:21:33.324 --> 00:21:40.282
professionals, because their role is
to heal. Have you found a great

629
00:21:40.282 --> 00:21:41.907
to heal. Have you found a great
brigadier or a major commanding the

630
00:21:41.907 --> 00:21:44.366
brigadier or a major commanding the
distribution of all of this and not

631
00:21:44.366 --> 00:21:45.699
distribution of all of this and not
just relying on a haphazard way of

632
00:21:45.699 --> 00:21:51.199
just relying on a haphazard way of
doing it?

633
00:21:51.199 --> 00:21:51.324
ﬂ

634
00:21:51.324 --> 00:21:57.074
I agree so much. We have, we’ve got
Brigadier Phil Prosser, a remarkable

635
00:21:57.074 --> 00:21:57.657
Brigadier Phil Prosser, a remarkabla
man, who is

636
00:21:57.657 --> 00:21:58.532
Brigadier Phil Prosser, a remarkable
man, who is in charge of the

637
00:21:58.532 --> 00:22:00.866
man, who is in charge of the
logistical effort of getting this

638
00:22:00.866 --> 00:22:02.782
logistical effort of getting this
protective equipment out, and the

639
00:22:02.782 --> 00:22:04.824
protective equipment out, and the
army have been brilliant in

640
00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.199
army have been brilliant in
responding to this. But do you also

641
00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:07.824
responding to this. But do you also
agree with

642
00:22:07.824 --> 00:22:08.324
responding to this. But do you also
agree withJohn that

643
00:22:08.324 --> 00:22:08.574
responding to this. But do you also
agree with John that you’ve

644
00:22:08.574 --> 00:22:08.991
responding to this. But do you also
agree withJohn that you’ve come to

645
00:22:08.991 --> 00:22:09.657
agree with john that you’ve come to
this a bit

646
00:22:09.657 --> 00:22:12.866
agree withJohn that you’ve come to
this a bit late? I think it’s a bit

647
00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:14.074
this a bit late? I think it’s a bit
unfair. On the testing, for

648
00:22:14.074 --> 00:22:16.116
unfair. On the testing, for
instance, we’ve had the private

649
00:22:16.116 --> 00:22:17.741
instance, we’ve had the private
companies, the testing, the British

650
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:18.991
companies, the testing, the British
diagnostic companies, involved in

651
00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:21.199
diagnostic companies, involved in
this from the

652
00:22:21.199 --> 00:22:23.449
diagnostic companies, involved in
this from the start. We just have to

653
00:22:23.449 --> 00:22:23.991
this from the start. We just have to
fast the

654
00:22:23.991 --> 00:22:25.616
this from the start. We just have to
cast the net wider and wider to get

655
00:22:25.616 --> 00:22:26.741
fast the net wider and wider to get
things going

656
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:29.074
cast the net wider and wider to get
things going faster and faster, so,

657
00:22:29.074 --> 00:22:31.074
things going faster and faster, so,
for instance, the universities and

658
00:22:31.074 --> 00:22:32.741
for instance, the universities and
university labs, they’ve been

659
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:34.616
university labs, they’ve been
involved. Companies that are like

660
00:22:34.616 --> 00:22:37.199
involved. Companies that are like
Thermo Fisher, 3 global

661
00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:37.949
involved. Companies that are like
Thermo Fisher, a global company like

662
00:22:37.949 --> 00:22:38.866
Thermo Fisher, a global company like
ran docks,

663
00:22:38.866 --> 00:22:40.157
Thermo Fisher, 3 global company like
ran docks, which is a British

664
00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:40.324
ran docks, which is a British
m"WWW-

665
00:22:40.324 --> 00:22:42.241
ran docks, which is a British
company, they’ve been involved for a

666
00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:43.741
company, therve been involved for a
long time, but I

667
00:22:43.741 --> 00:22:44.907
company, they’ve been involved for a
long time, but I agree. I say that

668
00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:47.407
long time, but I agree. I say that
to explain what we’ve been doing,

669
00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:49.699
to explain what we’ve been doing,
but I agree with the Archbishop’s

670
00:22:49.699 --> 00:22:51.782
but I agree with the Archbishop’s
point, which is this really is a

671
00:22:51.782 --> 00:22:54.032
point, which is this really is a
national effort. Everybody can play

672
00:22:54.032 --> 00:22:54.491
national effort. Everybody ran play
their part,

673
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:56.282
national effort. Everybody can play
their part, whether it’s by staying

674
00:22:56.282 --> 00:22:58.699
their part, whether it’s by staying
at home, or whether it is if you are

675
00:22:58.699 --> 00:23:00.491
at home, or whether it is if you are
in one of these industries where you

676
00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:01.449
in one of these industries where you
ran really do

677
00:23:01.449 --> 00:23:02.741
in one of these industries where you
can really do your bit, then by

678
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:03.157
ran really do your bit, then by
stepping up

679
00:23:03.157 --> 00:23:06.324
can really do your bit, then by
stepping up to the plate. If

680
00:23:06.324 --> 00:23:06.532
can really do your bit, then by
stepping up to the plate. Ifjust

681
00:23:06.532 --> 00:23:07.407
stepping up to the plate. Ifjust
one example, GlaxoSmithKline, great

682
00:23:07.407 --> 00:23:08.199
one example, GlaxoSmithKline, great
British business, never done any

683
00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:11.157
British business, never done any
testing before in its life but

684
00:23:11.157 --> 00:23:12.116
testing before in its life but
pharmaceuticals are obviously quite

685
00:23:12.116 --> 00:23:15.032
pharmaceuticals are obviously quite
close to testing, very briefly and

686
00:23:15.032 --> 00:23:15.866
dose to testing, very brieﬂy and
did

687
00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.199
close to testing, very briefly and
did some for the Olympics, and when

688
00:23:17.199 --> 00:23:17.991
did some for the Olympic, and when
I phoned them

689
00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:19.491
did some for the Olympics, and when
I phoned them up and said, you’ve

690
00:23:19.491 --> 00:23:21.532
I phoned them up and said, you’ve
really got to turn your great

691
00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:22.657
really got to turn your great
industrial muscle to this problem,

692
00:23:22.657 --> 00:23:24.032
industrial musda to this problam,
they said,

693
00:23:24.032 --> 00:23:25.616
industrial muscle to this problem,
they said, how do we help? Let’s do

694
00:23:25.616 --> 00:23:27.532
they said, how do we help? Let’s do
it, let’s make it happen. That’s the

695
00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:30.949
it, let’s make it happen. That’s the
attitude that we need. If I may

696
00:23:30.949 --> 00:23:34.074
attitude that we need. If I may
still say yes, some stuff you have

697
00:23:34.074 --> 00:23:36.949
still say yes, some stuff you have
done and I’m not critical of because

698
00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:38.282
done and I’m not critical of because
this is something you can never

699
00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:38.699
this is something you ran never
prepare for.

700
00:23:38.699 --> 00:23:41.157
this is something you can never
prepare for. What I’m trying to say,

701
00:23:41.157 --> 00:23:42.116
prepare for. what I’m trying to say,
today, I heard

702
00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.199
prepare for. What I’m trying to say,
today, I heard you for the first

703
00:23:43.199 --> 00:23:44.657
today, I heard you for the first
time falling

704
00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:46.491
today, I heard you for the first
time calling upon all industry, all

705
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:47.824
time calling upon all industry, all
universities, all labs. Why didn’t

706
00:23:47.824 --> 00:23:49.324
universities, all labs. why didn’t
you do that

707
00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:52.032
universities, all labs. Why didn’t
you do that two weeks ago? That’s

708
00:23:52.032 --> 00:23:52.949
you do that two weeks ago? That’s
what I’m talking about. Galvanising

709
00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:55.991
what I’m talking about. Galvanising
together everybody, to me it was

710
00:23:55.991 --> 00:23:59.407
together everybody, to me it was
today, not three weeks ago.

711
00:23:59.407 --> 00:24:01.699
today, not three weeks ago.
Literally two weeks ago I did do the

712
00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:03.574
Literally two weeks ago I did do the
same cell but I obviously didn’t get

713
00:24:03.574 --> 00:24:05.532
same all but I obviously didn’t get
it to your ears.

714
00:24:05.532 --> 00:24:06.324
same cell but I obviously didn’t get
it to your ears. In this great

715
00:24:06.324 --> 00:24:09.741
it to your ears. In this great
response to this virus, you know,

716
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:13.616
response to this virus, you know,
you just do everything you can and

717
00:24:13.616 --> 00:24:13.907
you just do everything you ran and
when we

718
00:24:13.907 --> 00:24:15.907
you just do everything you can and
when we come up with an idea and we

719
00:24:15.907 --> 00:24:18.366
when we come up with an idea and we
haven’t thought of it before, I’m

720
00:24:18.366 --> 00:24:20.116
haven’t thought of it before, I’m
not going to shilly—shallying about.

721
00:24:20.116 --> 00:24:20.699
not going to shilly-shallying about.
We just get

722
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:23.824
not going to shilly—shallying about.
We just get on with it. Actually, I

723
00:24:23.824 --> 00:24:25.949
We just get on with it. Actually, I
have to say, this has been true, the

724
00:24:25.949 --> 00:24:28.074
have to say, this has been true, the
response of the country as a whole

725
00:24:28.074 --> 00:24:29.366
response of the country as a whole
has been great. People haven’t been

726
00:24:29.366 --> 00:24:30.824
has been great. People haven’t been
political or picking things apart.

727
00:24:30.824 --> 00:24:36.657
political or picking things apart.
Generally the senses this is a war,

728
00:24:36.657 --> 00:24:38.991
Generally the senses this is a war,
as Archbishop Sentamu just said, but

729
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:41.157
as Archbishop Sentamu just said, but
it’s a war on which we are all on

730
00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:43.324
it’s a war on which we are all on
the same side and that changes the

731
00:24:43.324 --> 00:24:43.532
the same side and that changes the
“Y

732
00:24:43.532 --> 00:24:45.616
the same side and that changes the
way that we deal with it, because it

733
00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:46.991
way that we deal with it, because it
means we’ve all got to pull

734
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:48.366
means we’ve all got to pull
together. I think that’s completely

735
00:24:48.366 --> 00:24:50.032
together. I think that’s completely
right. This is something where you

736
00:24:50.032 --> 00:24:50.991
right. This is something where you
want the whole country pulling

737
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:52.324
want the whole country pulling
together and it’s why you want all

738
00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:55.616
together and it’s why you want all
of the industry, why you want all of

739
00:24:55.616 --> 00:24:56.407
of the industry, why you want all of
the different organisations, and

740
00:24:56.407 --> 00:24:57.991
the different organisations, and
everybody wants to be part of this

741
00:24:57.991 --> 00:24:59.991
everybody wants to be part of this
and wants to innovate. I guess the

742
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:01.866
and wants to innovate. I guess the
only thing I would add is I think

743
00:25:01.866 --> 00:25:03.491
only thing I would add is I think
you said something really important

744
00:25:03.491 --> 00:25:05.741
you said something really important
today, Matt, when you talked about

745
00:25:05.741 --> 00:25:07.574
today, Matt, when you talked about
levelling with people. I think that

746
00:25:07.574 --> 00:25:07.949
levelling with peopla. I think that
does

747
00:25:07.949 --> 00:25:08.741
levelling with people. I think that
does also mean actually also

748
00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:09.991
does also mean actually also
levelling with people and being

749
00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:13.907
levelling with people and being
honest with things about things that

750
00:25:13.907 --> 00:25:15.616
honest with things about things that
should have happened faster or been

751
00:25:15.616 --> 00:25:17.616
should have happened faster or been
done earlier. That’s important

752
00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:17.824
done eartier. That’s important
because

753
00:25:17.824 --> 00:25:18.907
done earlier. That’s important
because it’s about building trust.

754
00:25:18.907 --> 00:25:19.866
because it’s about building tmst.
Yeah.

755
00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:22.241
because it’s about building trust.
Yeah. And when you are in a pandemic

756
00:25:22.241 --> 00:25:25.157
Yeah. And when you are in a pandemic
trust really matters and if people

757
00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:25.824
trust really matters and if peopla
think, or if

758
00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.032
trust really matters and if people
think, or if NHS workers who are on

759
00:25:27.032 --> 00:25:28.657
think, or if NHS workers who are on
the front line with this and

760
00:25:28.657 --> 00:25:29.699
the front line with this and
struggling with the pressures they

761
00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:31.616
stmggling with the pressures they
are facing, if

762
00:25:31.616 --> 00:25:32.991
struggling with the pressures they
are facing, if they lose trust and

763
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:36.532
are facing, if they lose trust and
feel like they are being given a

764
00:25:36.532 --> 00:25:38.157
feel like they are being given a
line from a press release or

765
00:25:38.157 --> 00:25:40.907
line from a press release or
whatever, it makes it much harder to

766
00:25:40.907 --> 00:25:43.032
whatever, it makes it much harder to
build that collective thing. So,

767
00:25:43.032 --> 00:25:43.366
build that collactive thing. So,
whilst I

768
00:25:43.366 --> 00:25:44.949
build that collective thing. So,
whilst I would strongly support the

769
00:25:44.949 --> 00:25:46.616
whilst I would strongly support the
measures you’ve announced today, I

770
00:25:46.616 --> 00:25:48.949
measures you’ve announced today, I
think I would probably also urge you

771
00:25:48.949 --> 00:25:50.699
think I would probably also urge you
to also be honest about the things

772
00:25:50.699 --> 00:25:53.949
to also be honest about the things
that may have gone wrong earlier on,

773
00:25:53.949 --> 00:25:54.907
that may have gone wrong eartier on,
or may not have

774
00:25:54.907 --> 00:25:56.491
that may have gone wrong earlier on,
or may not have slotted into place

775
00:25:56.491 --> 00:25:59.116
or may not have slotted into place
as fast as they should have done.

776
00:25:59.116 --> 00:26:01.574
as fast as they should have done.
And I think the impact, if you are

777
00:26:01.574 --> 00:26:04.157
And I think the impact, if you are
not honest, is we lose confidence.

778
00:26:04.157 --> 00:26:05.699
not honest, is we lose confidence.
So, people hearing about Great

779
00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:06.782
So, people hearing about Great
Ormond Street this afternoon having

780
00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:09.574
Ormond Street this afternoon having
a problem with its cardiac suite

781
00:26:09.574 --> 00:26:11.657
a problem with its cardiac suite
will lose confidence, because... Why

782
00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:13.616
will lose confidence, because... why
were they

783
00:26:13.616 --> 00:26:15.491
will lose confidence, because... Why
were they having a problem? We had

784
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:16.866
were they having a problem? We had
somebody who was infective operating

785
00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:19.616
somebody who was infective operating
and that means the staff will now

786
00:26:19.616 --> 00:26:21.491
and that means the staff will now
need to self isolates, patients will

787
00:26:21.491 --> 00:26:25.074
need to self isolates, patients will
have to be tracked and contacted, so

788
00:26:25.074 --> 00:26:27.491
have to be tracked and contacted, so
it’s important that actually we do

789
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:28.991
it’s important that actually we do
have the tests available. I was

790
00:26:28.991 --> 00:26:31.032
have the tests available. I was
having a debate on Newsnight the

791
00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:32.282
having a debate on Newsnight the
other night. Chris Hopson was saying

792
00:26:32.282 --> 00:26:34.657
other night. Chris Hopson was saying
there is only two tests available.

793
00:26:34.657 --> 00:26:37.574
there is only two tests available.
The timelines for us to get the

794
00:26:37.574 --> 00:26:40.032
The timelines for us to get the
swabs and having them on site in the

795
00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:41.907
swabs and having them on site in the
hospital need to be explicit because

796
00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:44.657
hospital need to be explicit because
otherwise we lose confidence. The

797
00:26:44.657 --> 00:26:46.324
otherwise we lose confidence. The
front line staff lose confidence in

798
00:26:46.324 --> 00:26:49.157
front line staff lose confidence in
what people are saying. I think this

799
00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:49.574
what peopla are saying. I think this
transparency

800
00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:50.657
what people are saying. I think this
transparency is really important and

801
00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:53.241
transparency is really important and
also being clear about some of the

802
00:26:53.241 --> 00:26:53.366
also being clear about some of the
challanges,

803
00:26:53.366 --> 00:26:54.824
also being clear about some of the
challenges, right? This is difficult

804
00:26:54.824 --> 00:26:55.032
challanges, right? This is difficult
and

805
00:26:55.032 --> 00:26:56.907
challenges, right? This is difficult
and there will be bumps in the road.

806
00:26:56.907 --> 00:27:00.532
and there will be bumps in the road.
I hope that by now these antibody

807
00:27:00.532 --> 00:27:03.157
I hope that by now these antibody
tests, the blood tests, you know, we

808
00:27:03.157 --> 00:27:05.574
tests, the blood tests, you know, we
bought a lot of them. We bought from

809
00:27:05.574 --> 00:27:06.741
bought a lot of them. We bought from
nine different companies and it’s

810
00:27:06.741 --> 00:27:07.782
nine different companies and it’s
disappointing that the first few

811
00:27:07.782 --> 00:27:12.116
disappointing that the first few
ones we’ve run are just not high

812
00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:12.574
ones we’ve nm are just not high
enough

813
00:27:12.574 --> 00:27:13.449
ones we’ve run are just not high
enough quality, but we’ve been

814
00:27:13.449 --> 00:27:14.657
enough quality, but we’ve been
completely upfront about the fact we

815
00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:16.616
completely upfront about the fact we
bought them and they haven’t worked

816
00:27:16.616 --> 00:27:18.491
bought them and they haven’t worked
and we’ll keep searching until we

817
00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:20.491
and we’ll keep searching until we
find one that is good enough. It’s

818
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:22.241
find one that is good enough. It’s
probably fair to say there is a

819
00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:24.366
probably fair to say there is a
confusion early on about what the

820
00:27:24.366 --> 00:27:25.449
confusion earty on about what the
strategy was,

821
00:27:25.449 --> 00:27:26.116
confusion early on about what the
strategy was, on the immunity

822
00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:27.116
strategy was, on the immunity
suppression... Never

823
00:27:27.116 --> 00:27:27.366
strategy was, on the immunity
suppression... Neverwith

824
00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:27.741
strategy was, on the immunity
suppression... Never with me.

825
00:27:27.741 --> 00:27:27.824
strategy was, on the immunity
suppression... Neverwith me. In

826
00:27:27.824 --> 00:27:28.574
suppression... Never with me. In
which rase

827
00:27:28.574 --> 00:27:29.449
suppression... Neverwith me. In
which case there’s been different

828
00:27:29.449 --> 00:27:31.574
which case there’s been different
views within the government and that

829
00:27:31.574 --> 00:27:33.491
views within the government and that
does happen. We understand that will

830
00:27:33.491 --> 00:27:35.657
does happen. We understand that will
happen sometimes, but... Do you

831
00:27:35.657 --> 00:27:39.907
happen sometimes, but... Do you
accept that? Know, I don’t.

832
00:27:39.907 --> 00:27:40.199
happen sometimes, but... Do you
accept that? Know, Idon’t. I’m

833
00:27:40.199 --> 00:27:40.282
happen sometimes, but... Do you
accept that? Know, I don’t. I’m not

834
00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:41.116
accept that? Know, Idon’t. I’m not
going to get into

835
00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:41.657
accept that? Know, I don’t. I’m not
going to get into the communications

836
00:27:41.657 --> 00:27:45.907
going to get into the communications
of it but we really clear about the

837
00:27:45.907 --> 00:27:47.824
of it but we really clear about the
strategy here, it is to save lives

838
00:27:47.824 --> 00:27:48.241
strategy here, it is to save lives
by ﬂattening

839
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:50.324
strategy here, it is to save lives
by flattening the curve and building

840
00:27:50.324 --> 00:27:50.616
byﬂatbening the curve and building
the

841
00:27:50.616 --> 00:27:52.657
by flattening the curve and building
the NHS capacity. Let’s take another

842
00:27:52.657 --> 00:27:56.032
the NHS capacity. Let’s take another
question, a pre—recorded question,

843
00:27:56.032 --> 00:27:56.407
question, a pre-recorded question,
from jennifer

844
00:27:56.407 --> 00:27:57.741
question, a pre—recorded question,
from Jennifer Brennan, Asaph what ——

845
00:27:57.741 --> 00:27:59.449
from jennifer Brennan, Asaph what --
a software

846
00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:00.157
from Jennifer Brennan, Asaph what ——
a software company director.

847
00:28:00.157 --> 00:28:03.157
from Jennifer Brannan, Asaph what ——
a software company director. What is

848
00:28:03.157 --> 00:28:03.407
a software company director. what is
truth

849
00:28:03.407 --> 00:28:05.116
a software company director. What is
truth about how our front line

850
00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.491
truth about how our front line
workers have ended up without the

851
00:28:06.491 --> 00:28:08.366
workers have ended up without the
PPE they so desperately need? Where

852
00:28:08.366 --> 00:28:09.241
PPE they so desperately need? where
are we just too

853
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:10.616
PPE they so desperately need? Where
are we just too late in placing

854
00:28:10.616 --> 00:28:11.241
are wejust too late in placing
orders

855
00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:12.824
are we just too late in placing
orders due to the incorrect initial

856
00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:15.532
orders due to the incorrect initial
strategy? Donna, this must be

857
00:28:15.532 --> 00:28:17.699
strategy? Donna, this must be
something you are hearing from your

858
00:28:17.699 --> 00:28:20.282
something you are hearing from your
members several times a day, I would

859
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:23.657
members several times a day, I would
think? Yes, it’s probably the most

860
00:28:23.657 --> 00:28:25.241
think? Yes, it’s probably the most
falls I’ve had,

861
00:28:25.241 --> 00:28:26.074
think? Yes, it’s probably the most
calls I’ve had, the most e—mails

862
00:28:26.074 --> 00:28:26.574
falls I’ve had, the most e-mails
I’ve had

863
00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:27.949
calls I’ve had, the most e—mails
I’ve had and contact I’ve had is

864
00:28:27.949 --> 00:28:29.366
I’ve had and contact I’ve had is
about personal protection equipment

865
00:28:29.366 --> 00:28:33.407
about personal protection equipment
and I think we’ve been urging the

866
00:28:33.407 --> 00:28:34.616
and I think we’ve been urging the
government for weeks now that this

867
00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:38.657
government for weeks now that this
needed to be a priority, because,

868
00:28:38.657 --> 00:28:41.241
needed to be a priority, because,
you know, you just cannot nurse

869
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:41.407
you know, you just cannot nurse
property,

870
00:28:41.407 --> 00:28:42.741
you know, you just cannot nurse
properly, there is no nurse that is

871
00:28:42.741 --> 00:28:43.199
property, there is no nurse that is
less than

872
00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:44.657
properly, there is no nurse that is
less than two metres away from a

873
00:28:44.657 --> 00:28:47.074
less than two metres away from a
patient if they are delivering care,

874
00:28:47.074 --> 00:28:48.324
patient if they are delivering rare,
so it was

875
00:28:48.324 --> 00:28:49.157
patient if they are delivering care,
so it was really important, I think,

876
00:28:49.157 --> 00:28:49.782
so it was really important, I think,
as jennifer said,

877
00:28:49.782 --> 00:28:53.574
so it was really important, I think,
asJennifer said, that we ramped up

878
00:28:53.574 --> 00:28:53.949
as jennifer said, that we ramped up
the personal

879
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:54.366
asJennifer said, that we ramped up
the personal protection equipment,

880
00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:56.241
the personal protection equipment,
and also that it isn’t

881
00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:56.616
the personal protection equipment,
and also that it isn’tjust the

882
00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:59.616
and also that it isn’tjust the
intensive care unit, that we

883
00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:01.032
intensive care unit, that we
sometimes get waylaid into thinking

884
00:29:01.032 --> 00:29:03.157
sometimes get waylaid into thinking
because as we said earlier a lot of

885
00:29:03.157 --> 00:29:04.824
because as we said eartier a lot of
the

886
00:29:04.824 --> 00:29:07.407
because as we said earlier a lot of
the coronavirus, or Covid—19, is in

887
00:29:07.407 --> 00:29:07.699
the coronavims, or Covid-19, is in
the community,

888
00:29:07.699 --> 00:29:08.616
the coronavirus, or Covid—19, is in
the community, so actually if you

889
00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:12.241
the community, so actually if you
are going as a health care worker or

890
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:12.699
are going as a health rare worker or
in social

891
00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:12.907
are going as a health care worker or
in social care

892
00:29:12.907 --> 00:29:13.532
are going as a health rare worker or
in social rare you

893
00:29:13.532 --> 00:29:14.491
are going as a health care worker or
in social care you can be coming

894
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:15.366
in social rare you ran be coming
across it, or you

895
00:29:15.366 --> 00:29:16.407
in social care you can be coming
across it, or you can have it from

896
00:29:16.407 --> 00:29:17.074
across it, or you ran have it from
members of your

897
00:29:17.074 --> 00:29:18.949
across it, or you can have it from
members of your own family, so we do

898
00:29:18.949 --> 00:29:19.782
members of your own family, so we do
need personal protection equipment.

899
00:29:19.782 --> 00:29:21.782
need personal protection equipment.
Whether it was that we didn’t have

900
00:29:21.782 --> 00:29:22.866
whether it was that we didn’t have
enough, I’ve

901
00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:23.657
Whether it was that we didn’t have
enough, I’ve been assured several

902
00:29:23.657 --> 00:29:26.366
enough, I’ve been assured several
times that we do have enough,

903
00:29:26.366 --> 00:29:29.824
times that we do have enough,
however, it’s the logistics. But,

904
00:29:29.824 --> 00:29:30.241
however, it’s the logistic. But,
even if

905
00:29:30.241 --> 00:29:32.241
however, it’s the logistics. But,
even if that is true, that is going

906
00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:33.782
even if that is true, that is going
to mn out.

907
00:29:33.782 --> 00:29:35.241
even if that is true, that is going
to run out. If you think about, you

908
00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:35.657
to mn out. If you think about, you
know, the

909
00:29:35.657 --> 00:29:37.574
to run out. If you think about, you
know, the number is as they are now,

910
00:29:37.574 --> 00:29:39.657
know, the number is as they are now,
we do have to make sure that we’ve

911
00:29:39.657 --> 00:29:40.491
we do have to make sure that we’ve
got a all to

912
00:29:40.491 --> 00:29:40.824
we do have to make sure that we’ve
got a fall to arms

913
00:29:40.824 --> 00:29:41.657
we do have to make sure that we’ve
got a call to arms in this country

914
00:29:41.657 --> 00:29:42.241
got a all to arms in this country
to be able

915
00:29:42.241 --> 00:29:43.991
got a call to arms in this country
to be able to manufacture the right

916
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.991
to be able to manufacture the right
equipment, because, actually, if we

917
00:29:45.991 --> 00:29:46.491
equipment, because, actually, ifwe
don’t have

918
00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:47.532
equipment, because, actually, if we
don’t have it we won’t have people

919
00:29:47.532 --> 00:29:47.949
don’t have it we won’t have peopla
to be

920
00:29:47.949 --> 00:29:50.157
don’t have it we won’t have people
to be able to deliver the care that

921
00:29:50.157 --> 00:29:51.407
to be able to deliver the rare that
we need,

922
00:29:51.407 --> 00:29:52.866
to be able to deliver the care that
we need, whether that’s doctors,

923
00:29:52.866 --> 00:29:54.241
we need, whether that’s doctors,
nurses, physics. They all need it

924
00:29:54.241 --> 00:29:55.199
nurses, physios. They all need it
because they

925
00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:56.157
nurses, physics. They all need it
because they are up close and

926
00:29:56.157 --> 00:29:57.699
because they are up close and
personal. What was your response to

927
00:29:57.699 --> 00:29:57.907
personal. what was your response to
what

928
00:29:57.907 --> 00:29:59.782
personal. What was your response to
what Matt had to say the press

929
00:29:59.782 --> 00:30:02.282
what Matt had to say the press
conference today? So my response is

930
00:30:02.282 --> 00:30:03.366
conference today? So my response is
that, 0K,

931
00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:04.157
conference today? So my response is
that, OK, I hear

932
00:30:04.157 --> 00:30:04.366
conference today? So my response is
that, OK, I hearwhat

933
00:30:04.366 --> 00:30:05.241
conference today? So my response is
that, OK, I hear what Matt says and

934
00:30:05.241 --> 00:30:08.366
that, OK, I hear what Matt says and
I believe it, to a degree, but I’m

935
00:30:08.366 --> 00:30:11.032
I believe it, to a degree, but I’m
still... To a degree! Because I’m

936
00:30:11.032 --> 00:30:12.616
still... To a degree! Because I’m
still getting calls on the ground

937
00:30:12.616 --> 00:30:14.782
still getting calls on the ground
that says, yes, I had a supply

938
00:30:14.782 --> 00:30:16.366
that says, yes, I had a supply
yesterday, but it’s running out and

939
00:30:16.366 --> 00:30:16.866
yesterday, but it’s mnning out and
I’ve used

940
00:30:16.866 --> 00:30:18.824
yesterday, but it’s running out and
I’ve used it all and that is the

941
00:30:18.824 --> 00:30:20.657
I’ve used it all and that is the
issue. 0K, we can move millions of

942
00:30:20.657 --> 00:30:21.282
issue. 0K, we ran move millions of
pieces of

943
00:30:21.282 --> 00:30:22.949
issue. 0K, we can move millions of
pieces of equipment but it needs to

944
00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:25.574
pieces of equipment but it needs to
be sustained so that actually people

945
00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:25.907
be sustained so that actually peopla
have it

946
00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:27.032
be sustained so that actually people
have it tomorrow, or when they need

947
00:30:27.032 --> 00:30:28.907
have it tomorrow, or when they need
at the next day. There is no point

948
00:30:28.907 --> 00:30:31.282
at the next day. There is no point
in ringing a hotline, as many nurses

949
00:30:31.282 --> 00:30:31.782
in ringing a hoﬂine, as many nurses
have done,

950
00:30:31.782 --> 00:30:32.949
in ringing a hotline, as many nurses
have done, and heard at the other

951
00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:35.782
have done, and heard at the other
end we don’t have it to give it to

952
00:30:35.782 --> 00:30:35.907
end we don’t have it to give it to
7°“-

953
00:30:35.907 --> 00:30:37.907
end we don’t have it to give it to
you, so if we are going to tell

954
00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:39.282
you, so if we are going to tell
health care workers that this is

955
00:30:39.282 --> 00:30:39.407
health rare workers that this is
availabla,

956
00:30:39.407 --> 00:30:41.241
health care workers that this is
available, we make sure that it is

957
00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:42.324
availabla, we make sure that it is
availabla,

958
00:30:42.324 --> 00:30:43.241
available, we make sure that it is
available, otherwise it causes a

959
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.782
available, otherwise it causes a
problem. Lack of confidence and

960
00:30:44.782 --> 00:30:45.199
problem. lack of confidence and
people do

961
00:30:45.199 --> 00:30:46.491
problem. Lack of confidence and
people do not feel secure in

962
00:30:46.491 --> 00:30:46.657
peopla do not feel secure in
delivering

963
00:30:46.657 --> 00:30:48.699
people do not feel secure in
delivering care. The reports we are

964
00:30:48.699 --> 00:30:49.199
delivering rare. The reports we are
seeing about

965
00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:49.991
delivering care. The reports we are
seeing about nurses rationing

966
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:51.324
seeing about nurses rationing
whether or not they can treat

967
00:30:51.324 --> 00:30:51.532
whether or not they ran treat
patients

968
00:30:51.532 --> 00:30:53.282
whether or not they can treat
patients because they don’t have the

969
00:30:53.282 --> 00:30:54.866
patients because they don’t have the
protective equipment, is there any

970
00:30:54.866 --> 00:30:56.741
protective equipment, is there any
truth in that? I’m sure there must

971
00:30:56.741 --> 00:31:03.449
truth in that? I’m sure there must
be if they are reporting that but in

972
00:31:03.449 --> 00:31:04.907
be if they are reporting that but in
main nurses don’t like to ration

973
00:31:04.907 --> 00:31:05.074
main nurses don’t like to ration
rare.

974
00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:06.366
main nurses don’t like to ration
care. What they do is put themselves

975
00:31:06.366 --> 00:31:07.699
rare. what they do is put themselves
at risk and

976
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.032
care. What they do is put themselves
at risk and often that’s

977
00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.241
at risk and often that’s
problematic. So, we will see where

978
00:31:09.241 --> 00:31:09.366
problamatic. So, we will see where
peopla

979
00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:10.116
problematic. So, we will see where
people haven’t been provided with

980
00:31:10.116 --> 00:31:10.991
people haven’t been provided with
the equipment they themselves are

981
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:13.657
the equipment they themselves are
going down stop that means there is

982
00:31:13.657 --> 00:31:16.199
going down stop that means there is
a patient without care. We started

983
00:31:16.199 --> 00:31:16.616
a patient without rare. We started
off with

984
00:31:16.616 --> 00:31:18.074
a patient without care. We started
off with 40,000 less. We’ve had a

985
00:31:18.074 --> 00:31:19.199
off with 40,000 less. We’ve had a
all to arms,

986
00:31:19.199 --> 00:31:19.991
off with 40,000 less. We’ve had a
call to arms, people have stepped

987
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:20.199
all to arms, peopla have stepped
forward,

988
00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:21.532
call to arms, people have stepped
forward, but if we don’t provide the

989
00:31:21.532 --> 00:31:23.866
forward, but if we don’t provide the
right equipment, in every other

990
00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:25.074
right equipment, in every other
country we’ve seen the health

991
00:31:25.074 --> 00:31:30.616
country we’ve seen the health
workers go down first when you were

992
00:31:30.616 --> 00:31:31.616
workers go down first when you were
asked about protective equipment,

993
00:31:31.616 --> 00:31:34.199
asked about protective equipment,
you said we’ll get it rolled out by

994
00:31:34.199 --> 00:31:36.532
you said we’ll get it rolled out by
this weekend, 151 lorries or

995
00:31:36.532 --> 00:31:37.741
this weekend, 151 lorries or
whatever it was, I got the

996
00:31:37.741 --> 00:31:40.491
whatever it was, I got the
impression it was sorted was I know,

997
00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:44.282
impression it was sorted was I know,
this is another mammoth effort and I

998
00:31:44.282 --> 00:31:45.949
this is another mammoth effort and I
agree with every word of what Donna

999
00:31:45.949 --> 00:31:50.949
agree with every word of what Donna
just said. Nurses, doctors, all

1000
00:31:50.949 --> 00:31:51.699
just said. Nurses, doctors, all
health care professionals put

1001
00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:54.616
health care professionals put
themselves literally on the front

1002
00:31:54.616 --> 00:31:56.824
themselves literally on the front
line and we’ve seen, very sadly,

1003
00:31:56.824 --> 00:31:58.866
line and we’ve seen, very sadly,
four doctors die so far and some

1004
00:31:58.866 --> 00:32:04.449
four doctors die so far and some
nurses. They are not even counting

1005
00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:05.782
nurses. They are not even counting
the nurses, Matt. I need a

1006
00:32:05.782 --> 00:32:08.032
the nurses, Matt. I need a
conversation. Say that again? We

1007
00:32:08.032 --> 00:32:10.616
conversation. Say that again? We
haven’t even counted the nurses yet.

1008
00:32:10.616 --> 00:32:12.532
haven’t even counted the nurses yet.
I keep asking for the stats on

1009
00:32:12.532 --> 00:32:15.574
I keep asking for the stats on
nurses. I didn’t know that, we will

1010
00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:19.574
nurses. I didn’t know that, we will
sort that out. I am asking, we as a

1011
00:32:19.574 --> 00:32:21.407
sort that out. I am asking, we as a
nation are asking our doctors,

1012
00:32:21.407 --> 00:32:25.741
nation are asking our doctors,
nurses, physios, pharmacists, to

1013
00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:26.491
nurses, physios, pharmacists, to
treat peopla

1014
00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:27.574
nurses, physios, pharmacists, to
treat people and to treat people you

1015
00:32:27.574 --> 00:32:28.157
treat peopla and to treat peopla you
do have

1016
00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:28.657
treat people and to treat people you
do have to

1017
00:32:28.657 --> 00:32:28.866
treat peopla and to treat peopla you
do have to say,

1018
00:32:28.866 --> 00:32:29.991
treat people and to treat people you
do have to say, as you said, up

1019
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:34.032
do have to say, as you said, up
close and personal. We have this

1020
00:32:34.032 --> 00:32:36.491
close and personal. We have this
mammoth logistical exercise and it’s

1021
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:38.991
mammoth logistical exercise and it’s
true, Donna is right, that we do

1022
00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:43.199
true, Donna is right, that we do
have the supplies. We have a massive

1023
00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:43.324
have the supplies. We have a massive
sunplv

1024
00:32:43.324 --> 00:32:44.407
have the supplies. We have a massive
supply in an enormous warehouse in

1025
00:32:44.407 --> 00:32:48.241
supply in an enormous warehouse in
the North West. We are getting...

1026
00:32:48.241 --> 00:32:50.074
the North West. We are getting...
We’ve got enough of it at the right

1027
00:32:50.074 --> 00:32:53.157
We’ve got enough of it at the right
time? Yes, for now, we’ve got to

1028
00:32:53.157 --> 00:32:54.699
time? Yes, for now, we’ve got to
keep the replenishing it and the

1029
00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:57.241
keep the replenishing it and the
domestic call to arms is important

1030
00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:57.449
domestic all to arms is important
here

1031
00:32:57.449 --> 00:32:57.699
domestic rail to arms is important
here as

1032
00:32:57.699 --> 00:32:59.782
domestic call to arms is important
here as well. We have domestic

1033
00:32:59.782 --> 00:33:01.157
here as well. We have domestic
suppliers who might have made

1034
00:33:01.157 --> 00:33:01.282
suppliers who might have made
dosing

1035
00:33:01.282 --> 00:33:03.157
suppliers who might have made
closing a couple of weeks ago who

1036
00:33:03.157 --> 00:33:05.157
closing a couple of weeks ago who
are now turning to make protective

1037
00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:06.782
are now turning to make protective
equipment and that is important.

1038
00:33:06.782 --> 00:33:08.616
equipment and that is important.
We’ve got to keep replenishing it.

1039
00:33:08.616 --> 00:33:09.199
We’ve got to keep replanishing it.
But

1040
00:33:09.199 --> 00:33:10.782
We’ve got to keep replenishing it.
But essentially the quantity of the

1041
00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:13.949
But essentially the quantity of the
stuff is not the problem in PPE, in

1042
00:33:13.949 --> 00:33:14.782
stuff is not the problem in PPE, in
protective equipment. The challenge

1043
00:33:14.782 --> 00:33:19.241
protective equipment. The challenge
is getting it to every single one of

1044
00:33:19.241 --> 00:33:21.741
is getting it to every single one of
the 1.4 million NHS staff, the over

1045
00:33:21.741 --> 00:33:24.782
the 1.4 million NHS staff, the over
2 million social care staff. It’s a

1046
00:33:24.782 --> 00:33:26.324
2 million social rare staff. It’s a
huge

1047
00:33:26.324 --> 00:33:27.532
2 million social care staff. It’s a
huge logistical exercise. If we come

1048
00:33:27.532 --> 00:33:29.616
huge logistical exercise. If we come
back to the previous point about

1049
00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:31.532
back to the previous point about
transparency and openness of the

1050
00:33:31.532 --> 00:33:33.282
transparency and openness of the
challenges, I’m completely open

1051
00:33:33.282 --> 00:33:39.074
challenges, I’m completely open
about the challenge here because

1052
00:33:39.074 --> 00:33:41.366
about the challenge here because
getting kit out of the warehouse and

1053
00:33:41.366 --> 00:33:43.282
getting kit out of the warehouse and
into the hands and onto the face of

1054
00:33:43.282 --> 00:33:47.157
into the hands and onto the face of
every single nurse who needs it,

1055
00:33:47.157 --> 00:33:49.116
every single nurse who needs it,
every single doctor, the right kit,

1056
00:33:49.116 --> 00:33:51.199
every single doctor, the right kit,
that is one of the biggest

1057
00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:53.366
that is one of the biggest
logistical challenges of peacetime.

1058
00:33:53.366 --> 00:33:55.032
logistical challenges of peacetime.
The reason, coming back to the

1059
00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.366
The reason, coming back to the
original question, the reason it

1060
00:33:56.366 --> 00:33:58.157
original question, the reason it
suddenly became a thing is that when

1061
00:33:58.157 --> 00:34:02.366
suddenly became a thing is that when
we put in the social distancing

1062
00:34:02.366 --> 00:34:03.699
we put in the social distancing
measures the demands for PPE from

1063
00:34:03.699 --> 00:34:06.241
measures the demands for PPE from
the front line suddenly shot up, so

1064
00:34:06.241 --> 00:34:09.949
the front line suddenly shot up, so
peopla did

1065
00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:11.282
the front line suddenly shot up, so
people did have local stores of it

1066
00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:11.991
peopla did have [oral stores of it
but they

1067
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:12.949
people did have local stores of it
but they burn through that very

1068
00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.699
but they burn through that very
quickly. This is where the army have

1069
00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.866
quickly. This is where the army have
been brilliant so far and I’m really

1070
00:34:17.866 --> 00:34:20.324
been brilliant so far and I’m really
glad to say that the number of calls

1071
00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:20.824
glad to say that the number of falls
to our

1072
00:34:20.824 --> 00:34:21.991
glad to say that the number of calls
to our hotline has fallen in the

1073
00:34:21.991 --> 00:34:22.574
to our hoﬂine has fallen in the
last few

1074
00:34:22.574 --> 00:34:24.157
to our hotline has fallen in the
last few days, which implies that

1075
00:34:24.157 --> 00:34:25.324
last few days, which implies that
there are fewer problems. But until

1076
00:34:25.324 --> 00:34:29.657
there are fewer problems. But until
every nurse and every doctor and

1077
00:34:29.657 --> 00:34:32.157
every nurse and every doctor and
every other health professional and

1078
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:34.116
every other health professional and
in social care, until they have the

1079
00:34:34.116 --> 00:34:34.282
in social rare, until they have the
protective

1080
00:34:34.282 --> 00:34:35.074
in social care, until they have the
protective equipment that they need,

1081
00:34:35.074 --> 00:34:39.657
protective equipment that they need,
I will not rest on this one. Yes, we

1082
00:34:39.657 --> 00:34:41.407
I will not rest on this one. Yes, we
got the emergency supplies two weeks

1083
00:34:41.407 --> 00:34:43.657
got the emergency supplies two weeks
at a go, we got cracking, but this

1084
00:34:43.657 --> 00:34:45.407
at a go, we got cracking, but this
is an ongoing problem that we are

1085
00:34:45.407 --> 00:34:46.866
is an ongoing problem that we are
going to have to just keep working

1086
00:34:46.866 --> 00:34:50.116
going to have to just keep working
at all the way through this. And

1087
00:34:50.116 --> 00:34:50.824
at all the way through this. And
john, it’s a

1088
00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:51.241
at all the way through this. And
John, it’s a huge logistical

1089
00:34:51.241 --> 00:34:51.741
john, it’s a huge logistical
problam,

1090
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:53.324
John, it’s a huge logistical
problem, isn’t it? A logistical

1091
00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:53.532
problam, isn’t it? A logistical
challange,

1092
00:34:53.532 --> 00:34:54.116
problem, isn’t it? A logistical
challenge, anyway, there’s no

1093
00:34:54.116 --> 00:34:54.366
challange, anyway, there’s no
getting

1094
00:34:54.366 --> 00:34:58.574
challenge, anyway, there’s no
getting away from that? Yes, it is,

1095
00:34:58.574 --> 00:35:00.782
getting away from that? Yes, it is,
but, as Donna said, you could have

1096
00:35:00.782 --> 00:35:03.116
but, as Donna said, you could have
it today and then you run out

1097
00:35:03.116 --> 00:35:04.449
it today and then you run out
tomorrow and that’s not very

1098
00:35:04.449 --> 00:35:08.741
tomorrow and that’s not very
helpful, so probably my advice to

1099
00:35:08.741 --> 00:35:09.741
helpful, so probably my advice to
the Secretary of State, please

1100
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:12.491
the Secretary of State, please
promise less and deliver more. Yeah.

1101
00:35:12.491 --> 00:35:12.991
promise less and deliver more. Yeah.
just promised

1102
00:35:12.991 --> 00:35:14.949
promise less and deliver more. Yeah.
Just promised less and deliver more.

1103
00:35:14.949 --> 00:35:15.949
just promised less and deliver more.
You ran

1104
00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:16.741
Just promised less and deliver more.
You can have the numbers and

1105
00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:17.407
You ran have the numbers and
figures. The

1106
00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:18.616
You can have the numbers and
figures. The question is if the

1107
00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.824
figures. The question is if the
delivery is lagging behind what is

1108
00:35:19.824 --> 00:35:23.032
delivery is lagging behind what is
required then ask again the

1109
00:35:23.032 --> 00:35:25.241
required then ask again the
industries in this country to work

1110
00:35:25.241 --> 00:35:27.616
industries in this country to work
all the hours that God gives them to

1111
00:35:27.616 --> 00:35:29.949
all the hours that God gives them to
deliver this PPE to those who need

1112
00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:31.574
deliver this PPE to those who need
it and also that it must be

1113
00:35:31.574 --> 00:35:33.491
it and also that it must be
appropriate to the person. I’ve got

1114
00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:36.241
appropriate to the person. I’ve got
a friend who is a nurse, where she

1115
00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:39.324
a friend who is a nurse, where she
was given a mask but it was far too

1116
00:35:39.324 --> 00:35:42.241
was given a mask but it was far too
big and it didn’t quite do the job

1117
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:44.366
big and it didn’t quite do the job
in the end, so make sure that the

1118
00:35:44.366 --> 00:35:45.491
in the end, so make sure that the
equipment is appropriate to the

1119
00:35:45.491 --> 00:35:46.824
equipment is appropriate to the
person who is doing this and make

1120
00:35:46.824 --> 00:35:49.699
person who is doing this and make
sure there isn’t a supply that runs

1121
00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:55.741
sure there isn’t a supply that runs
out. So, promise less, deliver more.

1122
00:35:55.741 --> 00:36:00.407
Yvette, we have had one tweet in
here, we have had quite a lot on

1123
00:36:00.407 --> 00:36:02.907
here, we have had quite a lot on
PPE, but one which struck me... Why

1124
00:36:02.907 --> 00:36:04.574
PPE, but one which stmck me... why
is there no

1125
00:36:04.574 --> 00:36:05.324
PPE, but one which struck me... Why
is there no PPE available anywhere

1126
00:36:05.324 --> 00:36:11.157
is there no PPE available anywhere
for carers coming into vulnerable

1127
00:36:11.157 --> 00:36:13.407
for carers coming into vulnerable
people’s homes? This is the area

1128
00:36:13.407 --> 00:36:14.991
people’s homes? This is the area
that I am most worried about, the

1129
00:36:14.991 --> 00:36:17.032
that I am most worried about, the
position for social care, that means

1130
00:36:17.032 --> 00:36:18.199
position for social rare, that means
peopla going

1131
00:36:18.199 --> 00:36:19.324
position for social care, that means
people going into people’s homes,

1132
00:36:19.324 --> 00:36:19.574
peopla going into people’s homes,
but

1133
00:36:19.574 --> 00:36:21.657
people going into people’s homes,
but also in care homes as well. I

1134
00:36:21.657 --> 00:36:21.782
but also in rare homes as well. I
have

1135
00:36:21.782 --> 00:36:23.282
but also in care homes as well. I
have heard from carers who are

1136
00:36:23.282 --> 00:36:26.241
have heard from carers who are
really worried because they go from

1137
00:36:26.241 --> 00:36:28.157
really worried because they go from
one home to another, they’re really

1138
00:36:28.157 --> 00:36:28.241
one home to another, therre really
worried

1139
00:36:28.241 --> 00:36:29.324
one home to another, they’re really
worried that they might be spreading

1140
00:36:29.324 --> 00:36:32.157
worried that they might be spreading
the virus inadvertently, as well as

1141
00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:35.616
the virus inadvertently, as well as
being worried about having the

1142
00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:37.574
being worried about having the
proper protection if they are caring

1143
00:36:37.574 --> 00:36:38.366
proper protection if they are raring
for people

1144
00:36:38.366 --> 00:36:40.199
proper protection if they are caring
for people who are ill. 50, I think

1145
00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:40.574
for peopla who are ill. So, I think
the social

1146
00:36:40.574 --> 00:36:42.366
for people who are ill. So, I think
the social care side to me feels one

1147
00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:42.782
the social rare side to me feels one
of the

1148
00:36:42.782 --> 00:36:44.241
the social care side to me feels one
of the most urgent to increase.

1149
00:36:44.241 --> 00:36:46.824
of the most urgent to increase.
Also, that I think when you’re

1150
00:36:46.824 --> 00:36:47.824
Also, that I think when you’re
dealing with something where you

1151
00:36:47.824 --> 00:36:51.199
dealing with something where you
need enough PPE for sometimes thing

1152
00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:54.991
need enough PPE for sometimes thing
moving very quickly, then you need

1153
00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:56.324
moving very quickly, then you need
oversupply in each area, in each

1154
00:36:56.324 --> 00:36:59.074
oversupply in each area, in each
community. So,

1155
00:36:59.074 --> 00:37:00.199
oversupply in each area, in each
community. 50, US saying nationally,

1156
00:37:00.199 --> 00:37:01.824
community. So, us saying nationally,
we might have enough totally if we

1157
00:37:01.824 --> 00:37:03.241
we might have enough totally if we
get all of the logistics right —

1158
00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:03.824
get all of the logistic right -
actually

1159
00:37:03.824 --> 00:37:05.241
get all of the logistics right —
actually we need much more than

1160
00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:07.282
actually we need much more than
that, in order to have the leeway

1161
00:37:07.282 --> 00:37:09.574
that, in order to have the leeway
whenever it is needed. We had our

1162
00:37:09.574 --> 00:37:10.241
whenever it is needed. We had our
[oral hospice at

1163
00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:10.949
whenever it is needed. We had our
local hospice at the beginning of

1164
00:37:10.949 --> 00:37:11.491
[oral hospice at the beginning of
the week,

1165
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:12.282
local hospice at the beginning of
the week, somebody got in touch

1166
00:37:12.282 --> 00:37:13.866
the week, somebody got in touch
because they were worried that they

1167
00:37:13.866 --> 00:37:16.574
because they were worried that they
were going to run out of PPE within

1168
00:37:16.574 --> 00:37:18.032
were going to mn out of PPE within
24 hours

1169
00:37:18.032 --> 00:37:19.532
were going to run out of PPE within
2A hours and might have to discharge

1170
00:37:19.532 --> 00:37:19.866
24 hours and might have to discharge
patients.

1171
00:37:19.866 --> 00:37:21.032
2A hours and might have to discharge
patients. Everybody pulled round,

1172
00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:22.991
patients. Everybody pulled round,
all of the other bits of the local

1173
00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:23.241
all of the other bits of the [oral
NHS

1174
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.574
all of the other bits of the local
NHS made sure that they could

1175
00:37:24.574 --> 00:37:27.366
NHS made sure that they could
provide the PPE, and we also had

1176
00:37:27.366 --> 00:37:27.657
provide the PPE, and we also had
suppUes

1177
00:37:27.657 --> 00:37:29.366
provide the PPE, and we also had
supplies from the local FE College,

1178
00:37:29.366 --> 00:37:30.741
supplies from the local FE College,
everybody pulling together. It is

1179
00:37:30.741 --> 00:37:33.366
everybody pulling together. It is
really uncomfortable to having the

1180
00:37:33.366 --> 00:37:34.824
really uncomfortable to having the
last of the local FE College for

1181
00:37:34.824 --> 00:37:35.032
last of the [oral FE College for
some

1182
00:37:35.032 --> 00:37:36.157
last of the local FE College for
some of the supplies that they need,

1183
00:37:36.157 --> 00:37:37.741
some of the supplies that they need,
that does not feel like that is the

1184
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:38.032
that does not feel like that is the
“Y

1185
00:37:38.032 --> 00:37:39.574
that does not feel like that is the
way we want to be running things,

1186
00:37:39.574 --> 00:37:40.699
way we want to be mnning things,
but it’s a great

1187
00:37:40.699 --> 00:37:41.116
way we want to be running things,
but it’s a great example of

1188
00:37:41.116 --> 00:37:43.782
but it’s a great example of
everybody pulling together. But if

1189
00:37:43.782 --> 00:37:47.449
everybody pulling together. But if
you had enough in each area to be

1190
00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:49.949
you had enough in each area to be
able to manage that, then that would

1191
00:37:49.949 --> 00:37:51.616
able to manage that, then that would
be easier. And I think when we are

1192
00:37:51.616 --> 00:37:54.907
be easier. And I think when we are
at a time, when it comes to social

1193
00:37:54.907 --> 00:37:55.741
at a time, when it comes to social
rare, for our

1194
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:56.991
at a time, when it comes to social
care, for our carers and also our

1195
00:37:56.991 --> 00:37:57.616
rare, for our carers and also our
NHS staff, they

1196
00:37:57.616 --> 00:37:58.949
care, for our carers and also our
NHS staff, they are having to do the

1197
00:37:58.949 --> 00:38:00.824
NHS staff, they are having to do the
most incredible thing is, they are

1198
00:38:00.824 --> 00:38:02.991
most incredible thing is, they are
having to save lives, to care for

1199
00:38:02.991 --> 00:38:03.407
having to save lives, to rare for
those

1200
00:38:03.407 --> 00:38:06.199
having to save lives, to care for
those who are dying, to face this

1201
00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:07.449
those who are dying, to face this
horrible virus, really, the least

1202
00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:09.282
horrible virus, really, the least
that we can do is to make sure that

1203
00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:09.907
that we ran do is to make sure that
they have the

1204
00:38:09.907 --> 00:38:10.907
that we can do is to make sure that
they have the protection that they

1205
00:38:10.907 --> 00:38:17.032
they have the protection that they
need. That example is a very good

1206
00:38:17.032 --> 00:38:23.449
need. That example is a very good
one. St—Pierre school, which is a

1207
00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:23.574
one. St-Pierre school, which is a
pub“:

1208
00:38:23.574 --> 00:38:24.366
one. St-Pierre school, which is a
public school,

1209
00:38:24.366 --> 00:38:25.366
one. St—Pierre school, which is a
public school, because children have

1210
00:38:25.366 --> 00:38:27.866
public school, because children have
gone home, they really dedicated and

1211
00:38:27.866 --> 00:38:30.824
gone home, they really dedicated and
gave all their PPE to your hospital.

1212
00:38:30.824 --> 00:38:31.407
gave all their PPE to your hospital.
-- to York

1213
00:38:31.407 --> 00:38:36.949
gave all their PPE to your hospital.
—— to York Hospital. The whole lot.

1214

-- to York Hospital. The whola lot.

1215
00:38:41.032 --> 00:38:41.241
—— to York Hospital. The whole lot.
—— St Peter’s. And that was a

1216
00:38:41.241 --> 00:38:41.407
-- St Peter’s. And that was a
fantastic help.

1217
00:38:41.407 --> 00:38:45.116
—— St Peter’s. And that was a
fantastic help. But in the end,

1218
00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:47.241
fantastic help. But in the end,
please, Secretary of State,

1219
00:38:47.241 --> 00:38:51.366
please, Secretary of State,
production has got to work overtime,

1220
00:38:51.366 --> 00:38:53.241
production has got to work overtime,
in order that, as Yvette Cooper

1221
00:38:53.241 --> 00:38:56.491
in order that, as Yvette Cooper
said, actually, there is enough not

1222
00:38:56.491 --> 00:38:59.241
said, actually, there is enough not
just for today but for the following

1223
00:38:59.241 --> 00:39:01.116
just for today but for the following
two weeks, three weeks, four weeks.

1224
00:39:01.116 --> 00:39:03.991
two weeks, three weeks, four weeks.
And get all the factories to do the

1225
00:39:03.991 --> 00:39:06.366
And get all the factories to do the
same. Burberry is now producing

1226
00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:08.866
same. Burberry is now producing
gowns and using its supply chain to

1227
00:39:08.866 --> 00:39:11.032
gowns and using its supply chain to
get masks in. All of that kind of

1228
00:39:11.032 --> 00:39:11.407
get masks in. All of that kind of
thing, let’s

1229
00:39:11.407 --> 00:39:13.324
get masks in. All of that kind of
thing, let’sjust gear up

1230
00:39:13.324 --> 00:39:14.199
get masks in. All of that kind of
thing, let’s just gear up and get

1231
00:39:14.199 --> 00:39:15.657
thing, let’s just gear up and get
all of those parts of our industry

1232
00:39:15.657 --> 00:39:17.866
all of those parts of our industry
supporting our NHS as well, because

1233
00:39:17.866 --> 00:39:20.699
supporting our NHS as well, because
I think people really want to. And

1234
00:39:20.699 --> 00:39:21.116
I think peopla really want to. And
we have

1235
00:39:21.116 --> 00:39:23.157
I think people really want to. And
we have to recognise that if we

1236
00:39:23.157 --> 00:39:24.949
we have to recognise that if we
don’t provide for social care or in

1237
00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:25.407
don’t provide for social rare or in
the community,

1238
00:39:25.407 --> 00:39:25.907
don’t provide for social care or in
the community, it will

1239
00:39:25.907 --> 00:39:27.532
don’t provide for social care or in
the community, it willjust put a

1240
00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:27.657
the community, it will just put a
burden

1241
00:39:27.657 --> 00:39:28.991
the community, it willjust put a
burden on the hospital. We represent

1242
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:31.324
burden on the hospital. We represent
nurses both in the independent

1243
00:39:31.324 --> 00:39:32.741
nurses both in the independent
sector, in the community, and social

1244
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:33.407
sector, in the community, and social
rare,

1245
00:39:33.407 --> 00:39:35.116
sector, in the community, and social
care, and there are carers that also

1246
00:39:35.116 --> 00:39:35.657
rare, and there are carers that also
need this

1247
00:39:35.657 --> 00:39:36.574
care, and there are carers that also
need this equipment, otherwise we

1248
00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:38.449
need this equipment, otherwise we
will burden the hospitals and not be

1249
00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:40.449
will burden the hospitals and not be
able to look after people in the

1250
00:39:40.449 --> 00:39:40.657
able to look after peoplo in the
community.

1251
00:39:40.657 --> 00:39:42.157
able to look after people in the
community. And we will need to do

1252
00:39:42.157 --> 00:39:44.657
community. And we will need to do
that, because we will reach capacity

1253
00:39:44.657 --> 00:39:46.074
that, because we will reach capacity
in hospitals very soon, so we have

1254
00:39:46.074 --> 00:39:48.324
in hospitals very soon, so we have
got a number of other questions, one

1255
00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:49.491
got a number of other questions, one
that has just

1256
00:39:49.491 --> 00:39:49.741
got a number of other questions, one
that hasjust come

1257
00:39:49.741 --> 00:39:50.532
got a number of other questions, one
that has just come in online,

1258
00:39:50.532 --> 00:39:51.449
got a number of other questions, one
that hasjust come in online, and it

1259
00:39:51.449 --> 00:39:52.407
that has just come in online, and it
says, this is

1260
00:39:52.407 --> 00:39:53.449
that hasjust come in online, and it
says, this is mainly for you, Matt,

1261
00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:55.907
says, this is mainly for you, Matt,
of course, we’re delighted that you

1262
00:39:55.907 --> 00:39:58.032
of course, we’re delighted that you
are here with us, and recovered...

1263
00:39:58.032 --> 00:40:00.657
are here with us, and recovered...
It says, should the UK align its

1264
00:40:00.657 --> 00:40:03.449
It says, should the UK align its
advice with the WHO guidelines that

1265
00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:05.991
advice with the WHO guidelines that
people with Covid—19 can still be

1266
00:40:05.991 --> 00:40:08.282
people with Covid—19 can still be
infectious for M days after

1267
00:40:08.282 --> 00:40:10.366
infectious for M days after
recovering? Donna is going like this

1268
00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:12.116
recovering? Donna is going like this
conscious you are back here after

1269
00:40:12.116 --> 00:40:13.824
conscious you are back here after
seven days, so why the difference?

1270
00:40:13.824 --> 00:40:15.491
seven days, so why the difference?
You might not be surprised to hear

1271
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:18.824
You might not be surprised to hear
that I did check this before coming

1272
00:40:18.824 --> 00:40:19.991
that I did check this before coming
out of self isolation. Surprised and

1273
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:23.491
out of self isolation. Surprised and
relieved?! And the clear medical

1274
00:40:23.491 --> 00:40:24.574
relieved?! And the clear medical
advice from the Chief Medical

1275
00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:26.449
advice from the Chief Medical
Officer, who has looked into this,

1276
00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:31.574
Officer, who has looked into this,
is that the transmission tends to

1277
00:40:31.574 --> 00:40:33.449
is that the transmission tends to
stop before seven days, and seven

1278
00:40:33.449 --> 00:40:35.491
stop before seven days, and seven
days is the appropriate amount of

1279
00:40:35.491 --> 00:40:36.616
days is the appropriate amount of
time. Donna is looking rather

1280
00:40:36.616 --> 00:40:39.532
time. Donna is looking rather
sceptical. I am very sceptical

1281
00:40:39.532 --> 00:40:41.282
sceptical. I am very sceptical
because I think the evidence is

1282
00:40:41.282 --> 00:40:43.574
because I think the evidence is
unclear about whether you’re still

1283
00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:47.032
unclear about whether you’re still
carrying, after the seven days.

1284
00:40:47.032 --> 00:40:49.157
carrying, after the seven days.
Well, this is an important point,

1285
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:51.282
Well, this is an important point,
that I continue to behave as if,

1286
00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:53.157
that I continue to behave as if,
like everybody else, it is not that

1287
00:40:53.157 --> 00:40:56.782
like everybody else, it is not that
because I have had it, I have a free

1288
00:40:56.782 --> 00:40:58.866
because I have had it, I have a free
pass now. I self—isolate the same as

1289
00:40:58.866 --> 00:40:59.449
pass now. I self-isolate the same as
anybody else.

1290
00:40:59.449 --> 00:41:00.782
pass now. I self—isolate the same as
anybody else. So it’s important that

1291
00:41:00.782 --> 00:41:01.074
anybody else. So it’s important that
peopla who

1292
00:41:01.074 --> 00:41:03.532
anybody else. So it’s important that
people who have been through it, we

1293
00:41:03.532 --> 00:41:05.574
people who have been through it, we
don’t yet have the science to know

1294
00:41:05.574 --> 00:41:07.741
don’t yet have the science to know
that they are immune and completely

1295
00:41:07.741 --> 00:41:10.532
that they are immune and completely
dear.

1296
00:41:10.532 --> 00:41:12.782
that they are immune and completely
clear. That science isn’t clear, as

1297
00:41:12.782 --> 00:41:13.491
dear. That science isn’t clear, as
you say. But

1298
00:41:13.491 --> 00:41:14.574
clear. That science isn’t clear, as
you say. But they advice on coming

1299
00:41:14.574 --> 00:41:15.991
you say. But they advice on coming
out of self isolation after seven

1300
00:41:15.991 --> 00:41:18.157
out of self isolation after seven
days is something that we went

1301
00:41:18.157 --> 00:41:19.366
days is something that we went
through with great rigour with the

1302
00:41:19.366 --> 00:41:22.157
through with great rigour with the
Chief Medical Officer. But it is an

1303
00:41:22.157 --> 00:41:23.491
Chief Medical Officer. But it is an
interesting point, so, if you’ve had

1304
00:41:23.491 --> 00:41:26.657
interesting point, so, if you’ve had
it, after seven days, you should

1305
00:41:26.657 --> 00:41:31.032
it, after seven days, you should
still effectively self—isolate,

1306
00:41:31.032 --> 00:41:33.532
still effectively self—isolate,
social distancing we should all be

1307
00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:38.949
social distancing we should all be
doing that anyway...? Yeah, when the

1308
00:41:38.949 --> 00:41:42.449
doing that anyway...? Yeah, when the
science is good enough to understand

1309
00:41:42.449 --> 00:41:43.949
science is good enough to understand
the immunity that people have after

1310
00:41:43.949 --> 00:41:46.449
the immunity that peopla have after
having had the

1311
00:41:46.449 --> 00:41:47.324
the immunity that people have after
having had the disease, then we are

1312
00:41:47.324 --> 00:41:52.449
having had the disease, then we are
looking at introducing something

1313
00:41:52.449 --> 00:41:53.949
looking at introducing something
like an immunity certificate, or

1314
00:41:53.949 --> 00:41:56.907
like an immunity certificate, or
maybe a wristband, that says, I’ve

1315
00:41:56.907 --> 00:41:58.116
maybe a wristband, that says, I’ve
had it and I’m

1316
00:41:58.116 --> 00:41:59.032
maybe a wristband, that says, I’ve
had itand I’m immune and I can’t

1317
00:41:59.032 --> 00:42:00.532
had it and I’m immune and I can’t
pass it on and I

1318
00:42:00.532 --> 00:42:01.324
had itand I’m immune and I can’t
pass it on and I and highly unlikely

1319
00:42:01.324 --> 00:42:03.366
pass it on and I and highly unlikely
to catch it. And we think that we

1320
00:42:03.366 --> 00:42:05.991
to catch it. And we think that we
will be able to get there. But as of

1321
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:06.991
will be able to get there. But as of
today, the scientists are not

1322
00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:08.699
today, the scientists are not
confident enough in understanding

1323
00:42:08.699 --> 00:42:12.324
confident enough in understanding
the progress of the disease after

1324
00:42:12.324 --> 00:42:16.199
the progress of the disease after
people have got through it, like I

1325
00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:17.324
peopla have got through it, like I
have, and

1326
00:42:17.324 --> 00:42:18.532
people have got through it, like I
have, and so therefore, the advice

1327
00:42:18.532 --> 00:42:20.282
have, and so therefore, the advice
remains executive same. It’s one of

1328
00:42:20.282 --> 00:42:22.199
remains executive same. It’s one of
these areas, and there are lots of

1329
00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:24.241
these areas, and there are lots of
them with coronavirus, where we are

1330
00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.116
them with coronavims, where we are
living in a world of

1331
00:42:26.116 --> 00:42:26.449
them with coronavirus, where we are
living in a world of uncertainty,

1332
00:42:26.449 --> 00:42:29.949
living in a world of uncertainty,
where the science is not yet clear.

1333
00:42:29.949 --> 00:42:31.116
where the science is not yet clear.
Donna is certainly agreeing with you

1334
00:42:31.116 --> 00:42:35.574
Donna is certainly agreeing with you
on that! Literally, we know that you

1335
00:42:35.574 --> 00:42:37.032
on that! Literally, we know that you
have an antibody to the virus, that

1336
00:42:37.032 --> 00:42:41.532
have an antibody to the virus, that
you had. But whether you can be

1337
00:42:41.532 --> 00:42:43.074
you had. But whether you can be
re—infected or not is not clear, the

1338
00:42:43.074 --> 00:42:43.532
re-infected or not is not clear, the
science is

1339
00:42:43.532 --> 00:42:46.199
re—infected or not is not clear, the
science is not clear on that. Do you

1340
00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:48.699
science is not clear on that. Do you
think the science is clear on the 1A

1341
00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:49.532
think the science is clear on the 14
days versus the

1342
00:42:49.532 --> 00:42:50.782
think the science is clear on the 1A
days versus the seven days? Do you

1343
00:42:50.782 --> 00:42:52.491
days versus the seven days? Do you
think the WHO is wrong to say 1A

1344
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:55.074
think the WHO is wrong to say 14
days? Here, I

1345
00:42:55.074 --> 00:42:55.282
think the WHO is wrong to say 1A
days? Here, Ifollow

1346
00:42:55.282 --> 00:42:55.574
think the WHO is wrong to say 1A
days? Here, I follow the

1347
00:42:55.574 --> 00:42:55.782
think the WHO is wrong to say 1A
days? Here, Ifollow the Chief

1348
00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.782
days? Here, Ifollow the Chief
Medical Officer very precisely, and

1349
00:42:57.782 --> 00:42:59.782
Medical Officer very precisely, and
he has looked into it in great

1350
00:42:59.782 --> 00:43:01.991
he has looked into it in great
detail and made the decision about

1351
00:43:01.991 --> 00:43:03.907
detail and made the decision about
seven days, and I asked exactly that

1352
00:43:03.907 --> 00:43:06.449
seven days, and I asked exactly that
question. And also whether you

1353
00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:07.532
question. And also whether you
should take a precautionary approach

1354
00:43:07.532 --> 00:43:10.782
should take a precautionary approach
on it if it is not clear? That’s

1355
00:43:10.782 --> 00:43:12.199
on it if it is not clear? That’s
right. We had exactly that

1356
00:43:12.199 --> 00:43:14.157
right. We had exactly that
discussion and he went and looked at

1357
00:43:14.157 --> 00:43:15.574
discussion and he went and looked at
the best science and made that

1358
00:43:15.574 --> 00:43:17.991
the best science and made that
decision must I would like to take a

1359
00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:19.532
decision must I would like to take a
couple of points now, I am going to

1360
00:43:19.532 --> 00:43:22.949
couple of points now, I am going to
take two consecutive points from two

1361
00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:26.157
take two consecutive points from two
peopla. I

1362
00:43:26.157 --> 00:43:26.282
take two consecutive points from two
peopla. Ilost

1363
00:43:26.282 --> 00:43:27.199
take two consecutive points from two
people. I lost my dad over two

1364
00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:27.574
peopla. I lost my dad over two
months ago

1365
00:43:27.574 --> 00:43:30.491
people. I lost my dad over two
months ago from pneumonia. My

1366
00:43:30.491 --> 00:43:30.907
months ago from pneumonia. My
85-year-old

1367
00:43:30.907 --> 00:43:31.657
months ago from pneumonia. My
85—year—old mum has underlying

1368
00:43:31.657 --> 00:43:31.866
85-year-old mum has undertying
health

1369
00:43:31.866 --> 00:43:34.241
85—year—old mum has underlying
health conditions and falls into the

1370
00:43:34.241 --> 00:43:35.532
health conditions and falls into the
vulnerable category. She is

1371
00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:36.657
vulnerable category. She is
self—isolating and unable to have

1372
00:43:36.657 --> 00:43:36.866
self-isolating and unabla to have
contact

1373
00:43:36.866 --> 00:43:39.491
self—isolating and unable to have
contact with most of her family. I

1374
00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:41.699
contact with most of her family. I
haven’t seen her for over three

1375
00:43:41.699 --> 00:43:43.366
haven’t seen her for over three
weeks. Being separated from us is

1376
00:43:43.366 --> 00:43:45.741
weeks. Being separated from us is
having a negative impact on her

1377
00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:47.741
having a negative impact on her
mental well—being. Are you able to

1378
00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:48.324
mental well-being. Are you able to
tell me

1379
00:43:48.324 --> 00:43:49.574
mental well—being. Are you able to
tell me with any certainty when I

1380
00:43:49.574 --> 00:43:50.949
tell me with any certainty when I
will safely be able to see her

1381
00:43:50.949 --> 00:43:54.616
will safely be able to see her
again? Earlier

1382
00:43:54.616 --> 00:43:54.949
will safely be able to see her
again? Earlierthis

1383
00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:55.199
will safely be able to see her
again? Earlier this week,

1384
00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.157
will safely be able to see her
again? Earlierthis week, my

1385
00:43:56.157 --> 00:43:56.491
will safely be able to see her
again? Earlier this week, my wife

1386
00:43:56.491 --> 00:43:57.449
again? Eadier this week, my wife
lost her

1387
00:43:57.449 --> 00:43:58.491
again? Earlier this week, my wife
lost her nan to Covid—19. She was

1388
00:43:58.491 --> 00:43:58.991
lost her nan to Covid-19. She was
fortunate

1389
00:43:58.991 --> 00:44:00.199
lost her nan to Covid—19. She was
fortunate enough in one of her final

1390
00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:01.782
fortunate enough in one of her final
few moments to have one of her

1391
00:44:01.782 --> 00:44:03.491
few moments to have one of her
daughters at her bedside. I know

1392
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:05.574
daughters at her bedside. I know
this has not been the case for every

1393
00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:07.366
this has not been the use for every
family. A lovely

1394
00:44:07.366 --> 00:44:08.532
this has not been the case for every
family. A lovely tribute was paid to

1395
00:44:08.532 --> 00:44:10.866
family. A lovely tribute was paid to
her on the front page of a

1396
00:44:10.866 --> 00:44:11.949
her on the front page of a
Kidderminster newspaper today. How

1397
00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:12.241
Kidderminster newspaper today. How
ran we

1398
00:44:12.241 --> 00:44:14.741
Kidderminster newspaper today. How
can we support those who are in

1399
00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:15.116
ran we support those who are in
grieving and

1400
00:44:15.116 --> 00:44:16.116
can we support those who are in
grieving and self isolation at this

1401
00:44:16.116 --> 00:44:19.366
grieving and self isolation at this
time? john,

1402
00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:20.824
grieving and self isolation at this
time? John, we’re hearing so many,

1403
00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:21.032
time? john, we’re hearing so many,
frankly,

1404
00:44:21.032 --> 00:44:22.449
time? John, we’re hearing so many,
frankly, heartbreaking stories of

1405
00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:23.116
frankly, heartbreaking stories of
peopla who

1406
00:44:23.116 --> 00:44:24.366
frankly, heartbreaking stories of
people who have lost their life

1407
00:44:24.366 --> 00:44:24.991
peopla who have lost their life
partner and

1408
00:44:24.991 --> 00:44:26.241
people who have lost their life
partner and then in the loneliness

1409
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:29.366
partner and then in the loneliness
of that position, have to be even

1410
00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.116
of that position, have to be even
more alone, self—isolating, or

1411
00:44:30.116 --> 00:44:30.282
more alone, self-isolating, or
families

1412
00:44:30.282 --> 00:44:37.407
more alone, self—isolating, or
families who can’t mourn together?

1413
00:44:37.407 --> 00:44:40.782
families who can’t mourn together?
On the BBC News at Six o’clock, they

1414
00:44:40.782 --> 00:44:43.449
On the BBC News at Six o’clock, they
had a story of a rabbi who died, and

1415
00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:45.949
had a story of a rabbi who died, and
he had been married with his Wi—Fi

1416
00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:46.116
he had been married with his wi-Fi
think

1417
00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:47.741
he had been married with his Wi—Fi
think about 60 years, and she

1418
00:44:47.741 --> 00:44:52.741
think about 60 years, and she
couldn’t go even to the funeral. The

1419
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:54.449
couldn’t go even to the funeral. The
undertaker had to do the funeral.

1420
00:44:54.449 --> 00:44:57.866
undertaker had to do the funeral.
What I have not fully understood, if

1421
00:44:57.866 --> 00:44:58.907
What I have not fully understood, if
undertakers handle the bodies and

1422
00:44:58.907 --> 00:44:59.449
undertakes handle the bodies and
are able

1423
00:44:59.449 --> 00:45:01.032
undertakers handle the bodies and
are able to take those bodies to be

1424
00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:04.241
are able to take those bodies to be
cremated, or to be buried, why in

1425
00:45:04.241 --> 00:45:08.366
cremated, or to be buried, why in
this particular case didn’t they

1426
00:45:08.366 --> 00:45:08.574
this particular use didn’t they
allow

1427
00:45:08.574 --> 00:45:10.157
this particular case didn’t they
allow at least the son, who is quite

1428
00:45:10.157 --> 00:45:12.907
allow at least the son, who is quite
young, to be present, and numbers

1429
00:45:12.907 --> 00:45:16.657
young, to be present, and numbers
restricted? And I think what is

1430
00:45:16.657 --> 00:45:17.616
restricted? And I think what is
going to be haunting her

1431
00:45:17.616 --> 00:45:18.074
restricted? And I think what is
going to be haunting herfor the

1432
00:45:18.074 --> 00:45:19.324
going to be haunting her for the
rest of

1433
00:45:19.324 --> 00:45:21.241
going to be haunting herfor the
rest of her life, I think, they had

1434
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:23.699
rest of her life, I think, they had
been married and never separated, I

1435
00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:26.074
been married and never separated, I
could not visit him because he had

1436
00:45:26.074 --> 00:45:26.991
could not visit him because he had
Covid-19, and

1437
00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:27.907
could not visit him because he had
Covid—19, and even in death I wasn’t

1438
00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:29.532
Covid-19, and even in death I wasn’t
allowed to go to

1439
00:45:29.532 --> 00:45:30.074
Covid—19, and even in death I wasn’t
allowed to go to the burial grounds.

1440
00:45:30.074 --> 00:45:34.657
allowed to go to the burial grounds.
I find that difficult. But I think

1441
00:45:34.657 --> 00:45:39.407
I find that difficult. But I think
the government has got to think this

1442
00:45:39.407 --> 00:45:40.949
the government has got to think this
one through, because people who...

1443
00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:41.741
one through, because people who...
And I ran

1444
00:45:41.741 --> 00:45:42.532
one through, because people who...
And I can understand why they don’t

1445
00:45:42.532 --> 00:45:42.949
And I ran understand why they don’t
allow peopla

1446
00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:45.991
And I can understand why they don’t
allow people to visit, because of

1447
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:48.532
allow people to visit, because of
the virus, but I don’t understand

1448
00:45:48.532 --> 00:45:53.282
the virus, but I don’t understand
why a family could not be by the

1449
00:45:53.282 --> 00:45:55.199
why a family could not be by the
graveside, or in the crematorium,

1450
00:45:55.199 --> 00:45:57.782
graveside, or in the crematorium,
provided the numbers are restricted.

1451
00:45:57.782 --> 00:46:01.699
provided the numbers are restricted.
And if people are just simply buried

1452
00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:02.449
And if peopla are just simply buried
and then

1453
00:46:02.449 --> 00:46:03.949
And if people are just simply buried
and then later on, when it is all

1454
00:46:03.949 --> 00:46:06.074
and then later on, when it is all
over, you go and see the grave and

1455
00:46:06.074 --> 00:46:06.574
over, you go and see the grave and
you 5“-

1456
00:46:06.574 --> 00:46:09.532
over, you go and see the grave and
you say, I wish I was there. So,

1457
00:46:09.532 --> 00:46:12.491
you say, I wish I was there. So,
peopla are

1458
00:46:12.491 --> 00:46:14.532
you say, I wish I was there. So,
people are grieving doubly. Not

1459
00:46:14.532 --> 00:46:15.074
peopla are grieving doubly. Not
being

1460
00:46:15.074 --> 00:46:16.074
people are grieving doubly. Not
being allowed to be present when

1461
00:46:16.074 --> 00:46:18.366
being allowed to be present when
they die. And I think that is very,

1462
00:46:18.366 --> 00:46:21.199
they die. And I think that is very,
very difficult. I think the

1463
00:46:21.199 --> 00:46:22.532
very difficult. I think the
restrictions, for example, that

1464
00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:24.616
restrictions, for example, that
there should be no funerals in

1465
00:46:24.616 --> 00:46:27.241
there should be no funerals in
churches, I think that is a right

1466
00:46:27.241 --> 00:46:31.407
churches, I think that is a right
decision, and people being buried or

1467
00:46:31.407 --> 00:46:32.949
decision, and people being buried or
cremated, but can the Secretary of

1468
00:46:32.949 --> 00:46:35.616
cremated, but ran the Secretary of
State explain

1469
00:46:35.616 --> 00:46:36.741
cremated, but can the Secretary of
State explain why, if undertakers

1470
00:46:36.741 --> 00:46:36.824
State explain why, if undertakes
handle

1471
00:46:36.824 --> 00:46:39.324
State explain why, if undertakers
handle the body, put it in a coffin,

1472
00:46:39.324 --> 00:46:40.241
handla the body, put it in a coffin,
then take

1473
00:46:40.241 --> 00:46:41.241
handle the body, put it in a coffin,
then take it to the crematorium or

1474
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:44.532
then take it to the crematorium or
the burial ground, why a member of

1475
00:46:44.532 --> 00:46:45.866
the burial ground, why a member of
the family, with clear social

1476
00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:49.616
the family, with clear social
distancing, could not be present?

1477
00:46:49.616 --> 00:46:51.282
distancing, could not be present?
Well, it’s heartbreaking and we back

1478
00:46:51.282 --> 00:46:52.616
Well, it’s heartbreaking and we back
more and more people who have known

1479
00:46:52.616 --> 00:46:53.074
more and more peopla who have known
somebody who

1480
00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:58.657
more and more people who have known
somebody who has died, and it’s

1481
00:46:58.657 --> 00:46:58.866
more and more people who have known
somebody who has died, and it’sjust

1482
00:46:58.866 --> 00:46:59.074
somebody who has died, and it’s just
awful.

1483
00:46:59.074 --> 00:47:02.324
somebody who has died, and it’sjust
awful. There’s two people I was very

1484
00:47:02.324 --> 00:47:03.157
awful. There’s two peopla I was very
fond of

1485
00:47:03.157 --> 00:47:04.282
awful. There’s two people I was very
fond of have died, and it’s starting

1486
00:47:04.282 --> 00:47:09.074
fond of have died, and it’s starting
to have that impact. In response to

1487
00:47:09.074 --> 00:47:10.866
to have that impact. In response to
this precise question, John, your

1488
00:47:10.866 --> 00:47:11.116
this precise question, john, your
instincts

1489
00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:14.366
this precise question, John, your
instincts are right. We have

1490
00:47:14.366 --> 00:47:16.866
instincts are right. We have
guidance for funerals that was put

1491
00:47:16.866 --> 00:47:19.282
guidance for funerals that was put
together, including with an ethics

1492
00:47:19.282 --> 00:47:19.657
together, including with an ethis
panel which

1493
00:47:19.657 --> 00:47:22.491
together, including with an ethics
panel which includes representatives

1494
00:47:22.491 --> 00:47:23.949
panel which includes representatives
of all the major faiths,

1495
00:47:23.949 --> 00:47:24.282
panel which includes representatives
of all the majorfaiths, and

1496
00:47:24.282 --> 00:47:24.491
panel which includes representatives
of all the major faiths, and that

1497
00:47:24.491 --> 00:47:26.907
of all the major faiths, and that
advice doesn’t say that families,

1498
00:47:26.907 --> 00:47:27.407
advice doesn’t say that families,
dose

1499
00:47:27.407 --> 00:47:29.741
advice doesn’t say that families,
close family, can go to a funeral.

1500
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:30.699
close family, ran go to a funeral.
So, I don’t

1501
00:47:30.699 --> 00:47:31.866
close family, can go to a funeral.
So, I don’t know the specifics of

1502
00:47:31.866 --> 00:47:32.241
So, I don’t know the specific of
this

1503
00:47:32.241 --> 00:47:34.407
So, I don’t know the specifics of
this individual case, but we must

1504
00:47:34.407 --> 00:47:35.116
this individual use, but we must
make

1505
00:47:35.116 --> 00:47:37.157
this individual case, but we must
make sure that that guidance, which

1506
00:47:37.157 --> 00:47:39.699
make sure that that guidance, which
rightly, as you say, says that the

1507
00:47:39.699 --> 00:47:41.866
rightly, as you say, says that the
numbers shouldn’t be large, that

1508
00:47:41.866 --> 00:47:44.949
numbers shouldn’t be large, that
that guidance is followed, and I can

1509
00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:45.824
that guidance is followed, and I ran
only think that

1510
00:47:45.824 --> 00:47:49.699
that guidance is followed, and I can
only think that the wife might have

1511
00:47:49.699 --> 00:47:50.907
only think that the wife might have
been in the right category, which

1512
00:47:50.907 --> 00:47:53.116
been in the right category, which
means that for her own protection,

1513
00:47:53.116 --> 00:47:55.324
means that for her own protection,
she should not see anybody or leave

1514
00:47:55.324 --> 00:47:57.741
she should not see anybody or leave
the house. But if we need to make

1515
00:47:57.741 --> 00:48:00.157
the house. But if we need to make
that clearer in the guidance, then

1516
00:48:00.157 --> 00:48:00.366
that dearer in the guidance, then
we

1517
00:48:00.366 --> 00:48:01.574
that clearer in the guidance, then
we absolutely will. And maybe we

1518
00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:03.866
we absolutely will. And maybe we
could talk about it afterwards,

1519
00:48:03.866 --> 00:48:04.866
could talk about it afterwards,
because decisions like that, of

1520
00:48:04.866 --> 00:48:07.157
because decisions like that, of
course, have to be based on the

1521
00:48:07.157 --> 00:48:07.324
course, have to be based on the
pub“:

1522
00:48:07.324 --> 00:48:08.157
course, have to be based on the
public health advice, but really

1523
00:48:08.157 --> 00:48:13.491
public health advice, but really
need to be taken by faith leaders

1524
00:48:13.491 --> 00:48:15.991
need to be taken byfaith leaders
making

1525
00:48:15.991 --> 00:48:16.657
need to be taken by faith leaders
making recommendations, alongside

1526
00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:19.032
making recommendations, alongside
the epidemiologists and the doctors,

1527
00:48:19.032 --> 00:48:22.949
the epidemiologists and the doctors,
to make sure that we get this right.

1528
00:48:22.949 --> 00:48:24.449
to make sure that we get this right.
So, I

1529
00:48:24.449 --> 00:48:24.574
to make sure that we get this right.
So, Ithink

1530
00:48:24.574 --> 00:48:26.199
to make sure that we get this right.
So, I think that the advice clearly

1531
00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:26.616
So, I think that the advice dearty
needs to

1532
00:48:26.616 --> 00:48:30.866
So, I think that the advice clearly
needs to be explained more clearly,

1533
00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:31.366
needs to be explained more dearty,
even if

1534
00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:32.449
needs to be explained more clearly,
even if the circumstances are, as

1535
00:48:32.449 --> 00:48:32.866
even if the circumstances are, as
you 5“-

1536
00:48:32.866 --> 00:48:35.324
even if the circumstances are, as
you say, from that example, and

1537
00:48:35.324 --> 00:48:37.782
you say, from that example, and
let’s try to fix that. Coming back

1538
00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:42.699
let’s try to fix that. Coming back
to

1539
00:48:42.782 --> 00:48:46.949
to the question from Govita, whose
85-year-old

1540
00:48:46.949 --> 00:48:48.241
to the question from Govita, whose
85—year—old mother is now a widow,

1541
00:48:48.241 --> 00:48:49.741
85-year-old mother is now a widow,
having lost her

1542
00:48:49.741 --> 00:48:50.824
85—year—old mother is now a widow,
having lost her husband, she is 85,

1543
00:48:50.824 --> 00:48:52.616
having lost her husband, she is 85,
she has to be shielded, so she’s all

1544
00:48:52.616 --> 00:48:57.991
she has to be shielded, so she’s all
alone in her home, and for a number

1545
00:48:57.991 --> 00:48:59.907
alone in her home, and for a number
of people who are tragically in that

1546
00:48:59.907 --> 00:49:01.241
of people who are tragically in that
situation now, how can they find

1547
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:01.491
situation now, how ran they find
comfort

1548
00:49:01.491 --> 00:49:02.949
situation now, how can they find
comfort in this situation that we

1549
00:49:02.949 --> 00:49:08.532
comfort in this situation that we
all find ourselves in?

1550
00:49:08.699 --> 00:49:11.116
all find ourselves in? Well, my
mother eventually died of cancer and

1551
00:49:11.116 --> 00:49:13.449
mother eventually died of cancer and
I was by her bedside for seven days.

1552
00:49:13.449 --> 00:49:14.907
I was by her bedside for seven days.
I think in this particular case, if

1553
00:49:14.907 --> 00:49:17.157
I think in this particular use, if
that was my

1554
00:49:17.157 --> 00:49:19.574
I think in this particular case, if
that was my mum, I can hear the

1555
00:49:19.574 --> 00:49:20.282
that was my mum, Iran hear the
guidance that

1556
00:49:20.282 --> 00:49:21.699
that was my mum, I can hear the
guidance that you shouldn’t take the

1557
00:49:21.699 --> 00:49:24.074
guidance that you shouldn’t take the
infection there, this is why I think

1558
00:49:24.074 --> 00:49:25.574
infection there, this is why I think
testing is important. If I am tested

1559
00:49:25.574 --> 00:49:27.657
testing is important. If I am tested
and I know that I haven’t got the

1560
00:49:27.657 --> 00:49:29.949
and I know that I haven’t got the
virus at all, I think I would go and

1561
00:49:29.949 --> 00:49:34.491
virus at all, I think I would go and
be with my grandmother. And then not

1562
00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:36.824
be with my grandmother. And then not
leave the home until everything is

1563
00:49:36.824 --> 00:49:38.866
leave the home until everything is
clear, because you could actually

1564
00:49:38.866 --> 00:49:39.241
dear, because you could actually
infect

1565
00:49:39.241 --> 00:49:40.532
clear, because you could actually
infect other people. So, I actually

1566
00:49:40.532 --> 00:49:40.741
infect other peopla. So, I actually
think

1567
00:49:40.741 --> 00:49:43.991
infect other people. So, I actually
think the guidance in terms of

1568
00:49:43.991 --> 00:49:45.532
think the guidance in terms of
raring for the

1569
00:49:45.532 --> 00:49:46.866
think the guidance in terms of
caring for the relations is quite

1570
00:49:46.866 --> 00:49:47.157
raring for the relations is quite
important.

1571
00:49:47.157 --> 00:49:48.491
caring for the relations is quite
important. Again, Donna was right,

1572
00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:50.574
important. Again, Donna was right,
communities are working hard and it

1573
00:49:50.574 --> 00:49:53.324
communities are working hard and it
is in those communities, this

1574
00:49:53.324 --> 00:49:54.366
is in those communities, this
particular virus could actually

1575
00:49:54.366 --> 00:49:56.657
particular virus could actually
spread widely if people are not

1576
00:49:56.657 --> 00:50:00.491
spread widely if people are not
tested. 50, I

1577
00:50:00.491 --> 00:50:00.657
spread widely if people are not
tested. 50, Iwould

1578
00:50:00.657 --> 00:50:01.074
spread widely if people are not
tested. 50, I would be

1579
00:50:01.074 --> 00:50:01.491
spread widely if people are not
tested. 50, Iwould be screaming

1580
00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:01.866
tested. So, Iwould be screaming
with my

1581
00:50:01.866 --> 00:50:03.449
tested. 50, Iwould be screaming
with my hospital that I need a test,

1582
00:50:03.449 --> 00:50:06.782
with my hospital that I need a test,
so that if I have not got it, I must

1583
00:50:06.782 --> 00:50:11.241
so that if I have not got it, I must
go and spend the rest of this self

1584
00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:13.241
go and spend the rest of this self
exclusion with my relative. You’re

1585
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:17.282
exclusion with my relative. You’re
right, because she, her

1586
00:50:17.282 --> 00:50:17.699
exclusion with my relative. You’re
right, because she, herworld is

1587
00:50:17.699 --> 00:50:18.116
right, because she, her world is
cmmbling in

1588
00:50:18.116 --> 00:50:19.574
right, because she, herworld is
crumbling in all kinds of ways, and

1589
00:50:19.574 --> 00:50:20.657
cmmbling in all kinds of ways, and
how ran it

1590
00:50:20.657 --> 00:50:21.241
crumbling in all kinds of ways, and
how can it be brought together,

1591
00:50:21.241 --> 00:50:21.491
how ran it be brought together,
other

1592
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:23.032
how can it be brought together,
other than a member of the family

1593
00:50:23.032 --> 00:50:25.074
other than a member of the family
getting the test and be unable to go

1594
00:50:25.074 --> 00:50:25.699
getting the test and be unabla to go
and

1595
00:50:25.699 --> 00:50:27.657
getting the test and be unable to go
and spend time with her, until the

1596
00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:30.282
and spend time with her, until the
government removes these reductions?

1597
00:50:30.282 --> 00:50:33.241
government removes these reductions?
Let me ask you about this one, we

1598
00:50:33.241 --> 00:50:34.949
Let me ask you about this one, we
have had a message in this point

1599
00:50:34.949 --> 00:50:37.574
have had a message in this point
from someone... I am so disturbed

1600
00:50:37.574 --> 00:50:38.574
from someone... I am so disturbed
that peopla are

1601
00:50:38.574 --> 00:50:39.699
from someone... I am so disturbed
that people are dying from Covid—19

1602
00:50:39.699 --> 00:50:40.699
that peopla are dying from Covid-19
in isolation,

1603
00:50:40.699 --> 00:50:41.949
that people are dying from Covid—19
in isolation, without any family. Is

1604
00:50:41.949 --> 00:50:43.991
in isolation, without any family. Is
it not possible, she goes on to say,

1605
00:50:43.991 --> 00:50:46.241
it not possible, she goes on to say,
to give PPE to at least one family

1606
00:50:46.241 --> 00:50:47.491
to give PPE to at least one family
member so that patients don’t have

1607
00:50:47.491 --> 00:50:50.866
member so that patients don’t have
to die alone? Not in any sense

1608
00:50:50.866 --> 00:50:52.866
to die alone? Not in any sense
underestimating quite what a

1609
00:50:52.866 --> 00:50:54.491
underestimating quite what a
challenge that is for nurses, I

1610
00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:56.907
challenge that is for nurses, I
mean, when we heard about the

1611
00:50:56.907 --> 00:50:57.032
mean, when we heard about the
13-year-old

1612
00:50:57.032 --> 00:50:58.991
mean, when we heard about the
13—year—old boy who died, I have to

1613
00:50:58.991 --> 00:50:59.407
13-year-old boy who died, I have to
say, I

1614
00:50:59.407 --> 00:50:59.866
13-year-old boy who died, I have to
say, Icried

1615
00:50:59.866 --> 00:51:00.366
13-year-old boy who died, I have to
say, I cried when I

1616
00:51:00.366 --> 00:51:01.366
13—year—old boy who died, I have to
say, I cried when I heard that, the

1617
00:51:01.366 --> 00:51:02.782
say, I cried when I heard that, the
thought of a child dying alone is

1618
00:51:02.782 --> 00:51:05.532
thought of a child dying alone is
just unbearable. Is there anyway

1619
00:51:05.532 --> 00:51:10.366
just unbearable. Is there anyway
around it?

1620
00:51:10.366 --> 00:51:10.991
ii

1621
00:51:10.991 --> 00:51:15.657
It wouldn’t surprise you that nurses
are thinking about this. I popped

1622
00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:17.449
are thinking about this. I popped
into the XL earlier this week to

1623
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:17.866
into the XL eartier this week to
talk to

1624
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.491
into the XL earlier this week to
talk to nurses about how they are

1625
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:21.324
talk to nurses about how they are
doing end—of—life care and they are

1626
00:51:21.324 --> 00:51:21.741
doing end-of-life rare and they are
thinking about

1627
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:23.116
doing end—of—life care and they are
thinking about how they can have

1628
00:51:23.116 --> 00:51:23.282
thinking about how they ran have
family

1629
00:51:23.282 --> 00:51:25.116
thinking about how they can have
family members communicating. We’ve

1630
00:51:25.116 --> 00:51:26.449
family members communicating. We’ve
had donations of mobile phones so

1631
00:51:26.449 --> 00:51:29.532
had donations of mobile phones so
that actually nurses can talk with

1632
00:51:29.532 --> 00:51:29.824
that actually nurses ran talk with
the

1633
00:51:29.824 --> 00:51:30.366
that actually nurses can talk with
the patient’s’ relatives

1634
00:51:30.366 --> 00:51:31.366
that actually nurses can talk with
the patient’s’ relatives as they are

1635
00:51:31.366 --> 00:51:31.532
the patient’s’ relatives as they are
delivering

1636
00:51:31.532 --> 00:51:32.866
the patient’s’ relatives as they are
delivering care by the bedside but

1637
00:51:32.866 --> 00:51:33.449
delivering rare by the bedside but
it’s why it’s

1638
00:51:33.449 --> 00:51:34.574
delivering care by the bedside but
it’s why it’s so important that we

1639
00:51:34.574 --> 00:51:37.532
it’s why it’s so important that we
ramp up the manufacturing of PPE

1640
00:51:37.532 --> 00:51:39.032
ramp up the manufacturing of PPE
because actually then you can start

1641
00:51:39.032 --> 00:51:39.407
because actually then you ran start
doing things

1642
00:51:39.407 --> 00:51:41.491
because actually then you can start
doing things like giving it to

1643
00:51:41.491 --> 00:51:41.616
doing things like giving it to
peopla

1644
00:51:41.616 --> 00:51:45.699
doing things like giving it to
people that can go into the homes,

1645
00:51:45.699 --> 00:51:45.907
peopla that ran go into the homes,
if

1646
00:51:45.907 --> 00:51:46.241
people that ran go into the homes,
if they are

1647
00:51:46.241 --> 00:51:48.241
people that can go into the homes,
if they are adequately protected.

1648
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:48.699
if they are adequately protected.
So, of

1649
00:51:48.699 --> 00:51:49.491
if they are adequately protected.
50, of course it’s not

1650
00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:49.949
if they are adequately protected.
50, of course it’s notjust the

1651
00:51:49.949 --> 00:51:50.116
So, of course it’s not just the
health

1652
00:51:50.116 --> 00:51:52.449
So, of course it’s notjust the
health care worker that may need it

1653
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:52.824
health rare worker that may need it
but actually

1654
00:51:52.824 --> 00:51:54.241
health care worker that may need it
but actually when somebody is in

1655
00:51:54.241 --> 00:51:55.407
but actually when somebody is in
isolation and actually it’s

1656
00:51:55.407 --> 00:51:56.907
isolation and actually it’s
affecting their mental health we may

1657
00:51:56.907 --> 00:51:59.282
affecting their mental health we may
need to do something very different.

1658
00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:05.741
need to do something very different.
Yvette? . Sorry, John is yellow your

1659
00:52:05.741 --> 00:52:06.116
Yvette? . Sorry, john is yellow your
hospital has

1660
00:52:06.116 --> 00:52:11.574
Yvette? . Sorry, John is yellow your
hospital has started giving patients

1661
00:52:11.574 --> 00:52:13.407
hospital has started giving patients
who are in isolation iPads and

1662
00:52:13.407 --> 00:52:15.824
who are in isolation iPads and
iPhones so they can get in touch

1663
00:52:15.824 --> 00:52:15.949
iPhones so they ran get in touch
with

1664
00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:17.157
iPhones so they can get in touch
with their relations and of course

1665
00:52:17.157 --> 00:52:20.866
with their relations and of course
then after it’s used properly

1666
00:52:20.866 --> 00:52:22.866
then after it’s used properly
disinfected, and I think this should

1667
00:52:22.866 --> 00:52:25.407
disinfected, and I think this should
be the way of assuring people that

1668
00:52:25.407 --> 00:52:25.866
be the way of assuring peopla that
they ran

1669
00:52:25.866 --> 00:52:26.074
be the way of assuring people that
they ran get

1670
00:52:26.074 --> 00:52:27.074
be the way of assuring people that
they can get in touch with their

1671
00:52:27.074 --> 00:52:27.616
they ran get in touch with their
loved

1672
00:52:27.616 --> 00:52:29.032
they can get in touch with their
loved ones and then they can

1673
00:52:29.032 --> 00:52:29.157
loved ones and then they ran
actually

1674
00:52:29.157 --> 00:52:31.032
loved ones and then they can
actually see their faces and see

1675
00:52:31.032 --> 00:52:35.282
actually see their faces and see
them and without that actually you

1676
00:52:35.282 --> 00:52:36.532
them and without that actually you
are almost isolating the person and

1677
00:52:36.532 --> 00:52:39.574
are almost isolating the person and
then when they don’t see their body

1678
00:52:39.574 --> 00:52:42.324
then when they don’t see their body
being buried again you are creating

1679
00:52:42.324 --> 00:52:46.574
being buried again you are creating
another heart wrenching exercise so

1680
00:52:46.574 --> 00:52:47.241
another heart wrenching exercise so
-- another

1681
00:52:47.241 --> 00:52:47.574
another heart wrenching exercise so
—— another heart—rending exercise.

1682
00:52:47.574 --> 00:52:49.616
-- another heart-rending exercise.
So get in touch

1683
00:52:49.616 --> 00:52:50.532
—— another heart—rending exercise.
50 get in touch with some clergy who

1684
00:52:50.532 --> 00:52:54.824
So get in touch with some clergy who
may be in touch with chaplains in

1685
00:52:54.824 --> 00:52:57.491
may be in touch with chaplains in
hospitals, like in York, they get in

1686
00:52:57.491 --> 00:52:59.574
hospitals, like in York, they get in
touch with the clergy and tell the

1687
00:52:59.574 --> 00:53:01.866
touch with the clergy and tell the
person how they are doing, and this

1688
00:53:01.866 --> 00:53:05.741
person how they are doing, and this
needs to be a sort of community

1689
00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:08.157
needs to be a sort of community
exercise in which we make it

1690
00:53:08.157 --> 00:53:09.449
exercise in which we make it
possible if you are able to

1691
00:53:09.449 --> 00:53:13.741
possible if you are able to
communicate to do it safely and then

1692
00:53:13.741 --> 00:53:16.032
communicate to do it safely and then
they will know where the illness is

1693
00:53:16.032 --> 00:53:18.366
they will know where the illness is
taking this people. But to die alone

1694
00:53:18.366 --> 00:53:18.782
taking this peopla. But to die alone
and not

1695
00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:20.449
taking this people. But to die alone
and not knowing since you went in

1696
00:53:20.449 --> 00:53:24.824
and not knowing since you went in
there is very difficult fuzz.

1697
00:53:24.824 --> 00:53:28.074
there is very difficult I think it’s
important to say most nurses don’t

1698
00:53:28.074 --> 00:53:28.866
important to say most nurses don’t
allow peopla

1699
00:53:28.866 --> 00:53:29.699
important to say most nurses don’t
allow people to die alone. Certainly

1700
00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:30.032
allow peopla to die alone. Certainly
if

1701
00:53:30.032 --> 00:53:30.574
allow peoplo to die alone. Certainly
if you are in

1702
00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.366
allow people to die alone. Certainly
if you are in hospital you will have

1703
00:53:32.366 --> 00:53:34.699
if you are in hospital you will have
a nurse, it’s not the same as your

1704
00:53:34.699 --> 00:53:36.116
a nurse, it’s not the same as your
family, but most nurses are very

1705
00:53:36.116 --> 00:53:38.241
family, but most nurses are very
conscious of that. One of my own

1706
00:53:38.241 --> 00:53:39.491
conscious of that. One of my own
stuff, her mother recently died and

1707
00:53:39.491 --> 00:53:41.407
stuff, her mother recently died and
she described the way in which

1708
00:53:41.407 --> 00:53:43.699
she described the way in which
people bent over backwards to

1709
00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:44.449
people bent over backwards to
facilitate her ability to

1710
00:53:44.449 --> 00:53:45.824
facilitate her ability to
communicate with her mother and she

1711
00:53:45.824 --> 00:53:48.032
communicate with her mother and she
was a nurse but she was really

1712
00:53:48.032 --> 00:53:50.157
was a nurse but she was really
grateful in her hour of need that

1713
00:53:50.157 --> 00:53:52.616
grateful in her hour of need that
actually we did facilitate her being

1714
00:53:52.616 --> 00:53:54.616
actually we did facilitate her being
able to communicate with her mother

1715
00:53:54.616 --> 00:53:56.741
able to communicate with her mother
before she died. 50, it is

1716
00:53:56.741 --> 00:53:56.949
able to communicate with her mother
before she died. So, it is possible.

1717
00:53:56.949 --> 00:53:58.241
before she died. So, it is possible.
We just have to

1718
00:53:58.241 --> 00:53:59.116
before she died. 50, it is possible.
We just have to find innovative ways

1719
00:53:59.116 --> 00:54:02.116
We just have to find innovative ways
of doing it because both shielding

1720
00:54:02.116 --> 00:54:03.449
of doing it because both shielding
individuals that might be vulnerable

1721
00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:06.449
individuals that might be vulnerable
but also stopping the spread fuzz

1722
00:54:06.449 --> 00:54:07.241
but also stopping the spread fun
yet I think

1723
00:54:07.241 --> 00:54:08.324
but also stopping the spread fuzz
yet I think nurses are doing an

1724
00:54:08.324 --> 00:54:10.824
yet I think nurses are doing an
amazing job to do that and we are

1725
00:54:10.824 --> 00:54:12.866
amazing job to do that and we are
very grateful but it’s one of the

1726
00:54:12.866 --> 00:54:13.907
very grateful but it’s one of the
cruellest things about this virus.

1727
00:54:13.907 --> 00:54:14.491
cmellest things about this vims.
It’s not only

1728
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:15.407
cruellest things about this virus.
It’s not only leaving people to die

1729
00:54:15.407 --> 00:54:15.574
It’s not only leaving peopla to die
without

1730
00:54:15.574 --> 00:54:16.866
It’s not only leaving people to die
without their family around them but

1731
00:54:16.866 --> 00:54:18.032
without their family around them but
also leaving people to grieve on

1732
00:54:18.032 --> 00:54:23.074
also leaving people to grieve on
their own as well, so I think the

1733
00:54:23.074 --> 00:54:23.866
their own as well, so I think the
starring effect,

1734
00:54:23.866 --> 00:54:24.241
their own as well, so I think the
scarring effect, the emotionally

1735
00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:24.574
starring effect, the emotionally
starring

1736
00:54:24.574 --> 00:54:25.366
scarring effect, the emotionally
scarring effects of this crisis,

1737
00:54:25.366 --> 00:54:26.991
scarring effects of this crisis,
however long it takes us to come

1738
00:54:26.991 --> 00:54:28.949
however long it takes us to come
through this, are going to be huge

1739
00:54:28.949 --> 00:54:30.824
through this, are going to be huge
for medical staff that will have

1740
00:54:30.824 --> 00:54:32.157
for medical staff that will have
worked in these environments, but

1741
00:54:32.157 --> 00:54:32.741
worked in these environments, but
also for

1742
00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:32.991
worked in these environments, but
also forfamilies

1743
00:54:32.991 --> 00:54:33.991
worked in these environments, but
also for families who will have lost

1744
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:35.991
also for families who will have lost
relatives without being able to be

1745
00:54:35.991 --> 00:54:38.782
relatives without being able to be
with them and it feels that we need

1746
00:54:38.782 --> 00:54:41.407
with them and it feels that we need
to also be investing in what those

1747
00:54:41.407 --> 00:54:43.532
to also be investing in what those
support services should be for

1748
00:54:43.532 --> 00:54:44.782
support services should be for
families in terms of dealing with

1749
00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:47.324
families in terms of dealing with
those bereavements and as we

1750
00:54:47.324 --> 00:54:48.574
those bereavements and as we
increase the testing, given what

1751
00:54:48.574 --> 00:54:50.491
increase the testing, given what
Matt said about the testing, I think

1752
00:54:50.491 --> 00:54:53.699
Matt said about the testing, I think
we should look at whether the sum of

1753
00:54:53.699 --> 00:54:55.074
we should look at whether the sum of
those community tests could be

1754
00:54:55.074 --> 00:54:56.449
those community tests could be
prioritised for those who have lost

1755
00:54:56.449 --> 00:54:59.366
prioritised for those who have lost
loved ones so that you don’t end up

1756
00:54:59.366 --> 00:55:02.116
loved ones so that you don’t end up
with a widow who has lost her

1757
00:55:02.116 --> 00:55:03.699
with a widow who has lost her
husband and then her daughter can’t

1758
00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:07.324
husband and then her daughter can’t
even go round to visit. If both mum

1759
00:55:07.324 --> 00:55:08.782
even go round to visit. If both mum
and daughter could just be tested

1760
00:55:08.782 --> 00:55:10.324
and daughter could just be tested
and then they could be together in

1761
00:55:10.324 --> 00:55:13.741
and then they could be together in
order to grieve. I’m going to move

1762
00:55:13.741 --> 00:55:16.116
order to grieve. I’m going to move
on very quickly but I wanted to read

1763
00:55:16.116 --> 00:55:18.574
on very quickly but I wanted to read
you this tweet that has come in from

1764
00:55:18.574 --> 00:55:19.282
you this tweet that has come in from
Tracy Sturgess. My

1765
00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:19.574
you this tweet that has come in from
Tracy Stu rgess. My greatest

1766
00:55:19.574 --> 00:55:19.949
you this tweet that has come in from
Tracy Sturgess. My greatest worry is

1767
00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.782
Tracy Sturgess. My greatest worry is
if my child, who has additional

1768
00:55:21.782 --> 00:55:23.574
if my child, who has additional
needs and a potentially life

1769
00:55:23.574 --> 00:55:25.241
needs and a potentially life
limiting illness, should he become

1770
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:26.699
limiting illness, should he become
ill he wouldn’t understand why I

1771
00:55:26.699 --> 00:55:28.324
ill he wouldn’t understand why I
couldn’t go with him to hospital and

1772
00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:32.491
couldn’t go with him to hospital and
it would break me and him. In this

1773
00:55:32.491 --> 00:55:34.616
it would break me and him. In this
circumstance could I go to hospital

1774
00:55:34.616 --> 00:55:36.241
circumstance could I go to hospital
with him? Lots of things to think

1775
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:38.991
with him? Lots of things to think
about there. Let me get this last

1776
00:55:38.991 --> 00:55:40.324
about there. Let me get this last
point it if I ran,

1777
00:55:40.324 --> 00:55:41.616
about there. Let me get this last
point it if I can, we’ve just about

1778
00:55:41.616 --> 00:55:43.116
point it if I ran, we’ve just about
got time, on a

1779
00:55:43.116 --> 00:55:44.074
point it if I can, we’ve just about
got time, on a different subject.

1780
00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:46.574
got time, on a different subject.
From Richard Tums. Good evening. As

1781
00:55:46.574 --> 00:55:50.282
From Richard Tums. Good evening. As
a retired police of his what are the

1782
00:55:50.282 --> 00:55:52.949
a retired police of his what are the
panel’s views on how the police are

1783
00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:55.282
panel’s views on how the police are
currently enforcing social

1784
00:55:55.282 --> 00:55:56.699
currently enforcing social
distancing and how can they complete

1785
00:55:56.699 --> 00:55:56.907
distancing and how ran they complete
this

1786
00:55:56.907 --> 00:55:58.449
distancing and how can they complete
this difficult role whilst at the

1787
00:55:58.449 --> 00:56:00.407
this difficult rola whilst at the
same

1788
00:56:00.407 --> 00:56:02.157
this difficult role whilst at the
same time continuing to police by

1789
00:56:02.157 --> 00:56:06.241
same time continuing to police by
consent? Yvette, I wanted to ask

1790
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:07.657
consent? Yvette, I wanted to ask
what you think about, there’s been

1791
00:56:07.657 --> 00:56:09.032
what you think about, there’s been
some controversy about some of the

1792
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.907
some controversy about some of the
things police forces are doing. I

1793
00:56:10.907 --> 00:56:12.491
things police forces are doing. I
think the police are in a difficult

1794
00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:14.824
think the police are in a difficult
position because everything is

1795
00:56:14.824 --> 00:56:16.116
position because everything is
moving so fast. The regulations

1796
00:56:16.116 --> 00:56:17.366
moving so fast. The regulations
coming on the Thursday and they

1797
00:56:17.366 --> 00:56:19.491
coming on the Thursday and they
immediately need to be enforced and

1798
00:56:19.491 --> 00:56:20.449
immediately need to be enforced and
that’s an inevitable consequence of

1799
00:56:20.449 --> 00:56:22.532
that’s an inevitable consequence of
the pace this is all moving. They

1800
00:56:22.532 --> 00:56:24.491
the pace this is all moving. They
have been some examples where I

1801
00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:25.074
have been some examples where I
think therve

1802
00:56:25.074 --> 00:56:25.491
have been some examples where I
think they’ve been miss

1803
00:56:25.491 --> 00:56:25.699
have been some examples where I
think they’ve been missjudgments

1804
00:56:25.699 --> 00:56:26.032
think therve been miss judgments
made

1805
00:56:26.032 --> 00:56:28.532
think they’ve been missjudgments
made all the police have not got the

1806
00:56:28.532 --> 00:56:30.491
made all the police have not got the
balance right, but overall I think

1807
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:34.616
balance right, but overall I think
the approach of placing an certainly

1808
00:56:34.616 --> 00:56:35.699
the approach of placing an certainly
senior police officers that’s been

1809
00:56:35.699 --> 00:56:37.032
senior police officers that’s been
reflected in the national guidance

1810
00:56:37.032 --> 00:56:37.199
reﬂacted in the national guidance
we’ve

1811
00:56:37.199 --> 00:56:38.866
reflected in the national guidance
we’ve now seen is that enforcement

1812
00:56:38.866 --> 00:56:41.157
we’ve now seen is that enforcement
is a last resort, the police’s role

1813
00:56:41.157 --> 00:56:41.824
is a last resort, the police’s rola
is to

1814
00:56:41.824 --> 00:56:42.157
is a last resort, the police’s role
is to encourage,

1815
00:56:42.157 --> 00:56:42.949
is a last resort, the police’s role
is to encourage, to engage. Most

1816
00:56:42.949 --> 00:56:45.741
is to encourage, to engage. Most
people really want to abide by the

1817
00:56:45.741 --> 00:56:46.866
people really want to abide by the
regulations. Most people want to do

1818
00:56:46.866 --> 00:56:47.282
regulations. Most peopla want to do
the right

1819
00:56:47.282 --> 00:56:48.241
regulations. Most people want to do
the right thing because this is

1820
00:56:48.241 --> 00:56:50.241
the right thing because this is
about our health. The police want to

1821
00:56:50.241 --> 00:56:52.241
about our health. The police want to
do the right thing. It’s important

1822
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:53.949
do the right thing. It’s important
that it is done in a proportionate

1823
00:56:53.949 --> 00:56:56.241
that it is done in a proportionate
way. It’s done in a way that

1824
00:56:56.241 --> 00:56:58.241
way. It’s done in a way that
supports the community. Our

1825
00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.991
supports the community. Our
tradition in this country has been

1826
00:56:59.991 --> 00:57:02.949
tradition in this country has been
policing by consent. Working in the

1827
00:57:02.949 --> 00:57:04.157
policing by consent. Working in the
police with the community, that’s

1828
00:57:04.157 --> 00:57:07.241
police with the community, that’s
what they want to do. In Knottingley

1829
00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:07.824
what they want to do. In Knottinglay
[oral police

1830
00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:08.157
what they want to do. In Knottingley
local police officers were

1831
00:57:08.157 --> 00:57:11.157
local police officers were
delivering lunches for a lunch club

1832
00:57:11.157 --> 00:57:12.657
delivering lunches for a lunch club
that has closed yesterday afternoon,

1833
00:57:12.657 --> 00:57:13.866
that has closed yesterday afternoon,
that’s the spirit of policing we

1834
00:57:13.866 --> 00:57:16.282
that’s the spirit of policing we
want to see. Andrew Stephenson says

1835
00:57:16.282 --> 00:57:18.574
want to see. Andrew Stephenson says
there’s too many cars on the road,

1836
00:57:18.574 --> 00:57:19.241
there’s too many cars on the road,
peopla are

1837
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:20.782
there’s too many cars on the road,
people are driving on them to go out

1838
00:57:20.782 --> 00:57:21.657
peopla are driving on them to go out
I haven’t

1839
00:57:21.657 --> 00:57:22.949
people are driving on them to go out
I haven’t seen checkpoints or police

1840
00:57:22.949 --> 00:57:24.241
I haven’t seen checkpoints or police
anywhere in the Medway towns. What

1841
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:24.866
anywhere in the Medway towns. what
is your feeling

1842
00:57:24.866 --> 00:57:25.741
anywhere in the Medway towns. What
is your feeling about the role of

1843
00:57:25.741 --> 00:57:30.407
is your feeling about the role of
the police so far? I would agree

1844
00:57:30.407 --> 00:57:33.282
the police so far? I would agree
with Yvette Cooper that there are

1845
00:57:33.282 --> 00:57:34.532
with Yvette Cooper that there are
some examples that are not very

1846
00:57:34.532 --> 00:57:39.199
some examples that are not very
good, but on the whole what I’ve

1847
00:57:39.199 --> 00:57:42.491
good, but on the whole what I’ve
seen on the media is that actually

1848
00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:45.241
seen on the media is that actually
some police officers are courteous

1849
00:57:45.241 --> 00:57:46.991
some police officers are courteous
but they make it very clear they

1850
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:47.366
but they make it very dear they
should

1851
00:57:47.366 --> 00:57:48.782
but they make it very clear they
should still not be moving around

1852
00:57:48.782 --> 00:57:49.991
should still not be moving around
unless they are really doing

1853
00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:52.574
unless they are really doing
something that is important and

1854
00:57:52.574 --> 00:57:57.741
something that is important and
necessary, just going about is not

1855
00:57:57.741 --> 00:57:58.741
necessary, just going about is not
good enough really. We haven’t

1856
00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:01.657
good enough really. We haven’t
experienced this country, in this

1857
00:58:01.657 --> 00:58:03.366
experienced this country, in this
country of the police being given

1858
00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:05.032
country of the police being given
such powers but they are limited and

1859
00:58:05.032 --> 00:58:07.241
such powers but they are limited and
they are going to be reviewed and I

1860
00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:10.157
they are going to be reviewed and I
want to encourage all my fellow

1861
00:58:10.157 --> 00:58:10.866
want to encourage all my fellow
citizens, please follow the

1862
00:58:10.866 --> 00:58:13.366

government guidance and if the

1863

government guidance and if the
police talk to you courteously they

1864
00:58:15.324 --> 00:58:18.199
police talk to you courteously they
are not wanting to take away your

1865
00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:20.449
are not wanting to take away your
liberty or freedom because this is a

1866
00:58:20.449 --> 00:58:22.866
liberty or freedom because this is a
tragedy for all of us and because

1867
00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:25.157
tragedy for all of us and because
it’s a tragedy, behave in such a way

00:58:26.074 --> 00:58:27.907
it’s a tragedy, behave in such a way
that all you can do is do no wrong.

1870
00:58:27.907 --> 00:58:29.032
that all you ran do is do no wrong.
Do no wrong to

1871
00:58:29.032 --> 00:58:29.741

constables reinforce the message

1875
00:58:34.907 --> 00:58:39.032

that actually the first of your role

1876
00:58:39.032 --> 00:58:39.407
that actually the first of your rola
is to

1877
00:58:39.407 --> 00:58:43.407
that actually the first of your role
is to persuade, is to encourage and

1878
00:58:43.407 --> 00:58:45.116
is to persuade, is to encourage and
fines are really a last resort.

1879
00:58:45.116 --> 00:58:47.199
fines are really a last resort.
Don’t go there very quickly. This

1880
00:58:47.199 --> 00:58:50.616
Don’t go there very quickly. This
lady was talking from York to

1881
00:58:50.616 --> 00:58:53.657

Newcastle and given such a hefty

Nemsﬂa and given such a hefty
fine, I’m

1883
00:58:53.991 --> 00:58:55.282
Newcastle and given such a hefty
fine, I’m going to find out what

1884
00:58:55.282 --> 00:58:57.532
fine, I’m going to find out what
happened, I don’t think that gives

1885
00:58:57.532 --> 00:58:59.741
happened, I don’t think that gives
us a good place. On the other hand

1886
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:02.616
us a good place. On the other hand
there is some people who don’t take

1887
00:59:02.616 --> 00:59:04.157
there is some people who don’t take
seriously that this is a deadly

1888
00:59:04.157 --> 00:59:09.116
seriously that this is a deadly
virus which could kill any others so

1889
00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:11.032
virus which could kill any others so

lives of other peopla. We’ve had a
tweeting from

1897
00:59:22.199 --> 00:59:23.991
lives of other people. We’ve had a
tweeting from Chrissie Crellin, I’ll

tweeting from Chrissie Crellin, I’ll
get your comment, Matt, she says it

was commented on the other day that

1900
00:59:27.324 --> 00:59:29.616
was commented on the other day that
vehicle use has increased, the

1901
00:59:29.616 --> 00:59:30.991
vehicle use has increased, the
police on the radio confirmed the

1902
00:59:30.991 --> 00:59:32.532
police on the radio confirmed the
same day that you can drive to

1903
00:59:32.532 --> 00:59:35.741
same day that you can drive to
somewhere close by to go for a walk.

1904
00:59:35.741 --> 00:59:36.657
somewhere dose by to go for a walk.
Is this right or

1905
00:59:36.657 --> 00:59:38.407
somewhere close by to go for a walk.
Is this right or not? It seems to be

1906
00:59:38.407 --> 00:59:39.907
Is this right or not? It seems to be
a daily argument online. People are

1907
00:59:39.907 --> 00:59:41.699
a daily argument online. People are
a bit confused about that kind of

1908
00:59:41.699 --> 00:59:43.657
a bit confused about that kind of
thing. Overall the number of people

1909
00:59:43.657 --> 00:59:45.657
thing. Overall the number of people
who are following the rules is very,

1910
00:59:45.657 --> 00:59:46.949
who are following the mles is very,
very high and I

1911
00:59:46.949 --> 00:59:47.699
who are following the rules is very,
very high and I agree very strongly

1912
00:59:47.699 --> 00:59:48.991
very high and I agree very strongly
with what Yvette said that policing

1913
00:59:48.991 --> 00:59:51.782
with what Yvette said that policing
by consent is the way we do it and I

1914
00:59:51.782 --> 00:59:54.241
by consent is the way we do it and I
think some of the stories in the

1915
00:59:54.241 --> 00:59:56.741
think some of the stories in the
media have been a bit overblown and

1916
00:59:56.741 --> 00:59:57.991
media have been a bit overblown and
weren’t quite what they first were

1917
00:59:57.991 --> 01:00:01.657
weren’t quite what they first were
reported as. I think that being able

1918
01:00:01.657 --> 01:00:03.532
reported as. I think that being able
to go out and take exercises

1919
01:00:03.532 --> 01:00:05.324
to go out and take exercises
important. The key thing is always

1920
01:00:05.324 --> 01:00:09.407
important. The key thing is always
to come back to the original public

1921
01:00:09.407 --> 01:00:11.991
to come back to the original public
health reason is that the advice is

1922
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:13.949
health reason is that the advice is
to stay at home, which is to not

1923
01:00:13.949 --> 01:00:15.282
to stay at home, which is to not
come into close contact with other

1924
01:00:15.282 --> 01:00:15.907
come into close contact with other
peopla. So, to

1925
01:00:15.907 --> 01:00:17.241
come into close contact with other
people. So, to get in your car and

1926
01:00:17.241 --> 01:00:17.574
peopla. So, to get in your far and
drive a

1927
01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:19.949
people. So, to get in your car and
drive a short distance to then go

1928
01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.491
drive a short distance to then go
for a walk on your own or maybe with

1929
01:00:22.491 --> 01:00:24.366
for a walk on your own or maybe with
your dog, that is fine because you

1930
01:00:24.366 --> 01:00:27.116
your dog, that is fine because you
are not coming into contact with

1931
01:00:27.116 --> 01:00:28.407
are not coming into contact with
another person and the advice is

1932
01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:31.949
another person and the advice is
really clear about that. We do want

1933
01:00:31.949 --> 01:00:32.491
really clear about that. We do want
peopla to

1934
01:00:32.491 --> 01:00:33.407
really clear about that. We do want
people to take exercise because I

1935
01:00:33.407 --> 01:00:35.366
people to take exercise because I
really am worried about the mental

1936
01:00:35.366 --> 01:00:38.074
really am worried about the mental
health concerns that we discussed

1937
01:00:38.074 --> 01:00:39.532
health concerns that we discussed
already and we know that exercise is

1938
01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:41.449
already and we know that exercise is
good for your mental and physical

1939
01:00:41.449 --> 01:00:42.532
good for your mental and physical
health. So,

1940
01:00:42.532 --> 01:00:44.699
good for your mental and physical
health. 50, follow the rules, stay

1941
01:00:44.699 --> 01:00:45.241
health. So, follow the mles, stay
at home,

1942
01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.741
health. 50, follow the rules, stay
at home, that protect the NHS, and

1943
01:00:46.741 --> 01:00:49.699
at home, that protect the NHS, and
it will save lives. Do take

1944
01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:52.241
it will save lives. Do take
exercise, but, when you do it, don’t

1945
01:00:52.241 --> 01:00:54.866
exercise, but, when you do it, don’t
go near anybody else who isn’t in

1946
01:00:54.866 --> 01:00:56.949
go near anybody else who isn’t in
your household. Matt, you have made

1947
01:00:56.949 --> 01:00:59.407
your household. Matt, you have made

01:02:33.199 --> 01:02:34.949
Remember when the news
was nothing but...

1979
01:02:34.949 --> 01:02:36.241
Brexit!

1980
01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:38.657
Brexit deal to deal with Brexit.
Oven—ready Brexit.

1981
01:02:38.657 --> 01:02:41.116
Back to face a new challenge...

1982
01:02:44.241 --> 01:02:46.657
I’m feeling nostalgic for
the Brexit question!

1983
01:02:47.532 --> 01:02:50.241
There’s only two ways to get
out of a bad deal, son.

1984
01:02:50.241 --> 01:02:52.366
You either negotiate your way clear,

1985
01:02:52.366 --> 01:02:54.824
or something happens
beyond your control.

1986
01:02:54.824 --> 01:02:57.116
You have got to talk to Emily.

1987
01:02:57.116 --> 01:02:59.366
How long before all goes...pff?

1988
01:03:27.116 --> 01:03:29.116
Your break—up with Sephy.
What was the reason?

1989
01:03:29.116 --> 01:03:30.199
Callum McGregor.

1990
01:03:30.199 --> 01:03:32.657
A pretty little bird told us.
Went straight to her father.

1991
01:03:32.657 --> 01:03:35.991
My baba’s handed himself in.
He’s saying he did it, to save me.

1992
01:03:35.991 --> 01:03:38.032
But he didn’t do it, though!
Of course he didn’t!

1993
01:03:38.032 --> 01:03:40.241
£20,000. And what do you get
for that?

1994
01:03:40.241 --> 01:03:41.532
This never happening again.

1995
01:03:41.532 --> 01:03:43.324
There’s going to be
a vote of no confidence.

1996
01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:44.532
And you’re not going to win it.

1997
01:03:44.532 --> 01:03:46.407
I’m sorry.

1998
01:03:46.407 --> 01:03:50.449
Ryan McGregor. I am mindful of
your obvious remorse.

1999
01:03:50.449 --> 01:03:54.241
There is an argument
to make an example of you.

2000
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:55.907
Come with me.

2001
01:03:57.907 --> 01:04:00.907
MAN SHOUTS
Don’t get involved.

2002
01:04:00.907 --> 01:04:05.241
This programme contains
some strong language

2003
01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:07.241
TV: I’m not saying
it’s definitive, no.

2004
01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:09.199
But given the newly—appointed PM’s

2005
01:04:09.199 --> 01:04:12.241
previous hardline stance
and comments, it seems plausible

2006
01:04:12.241 --> 01:04:14.949
we’ll see far stricter provisions
for law and order

2007
01:04:14.949 --> 01:04:17.407
implemented sooner
rather than later.

2008
01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:18.699
More on that in a moment.

2009
01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:20.949
However, some breaking newsjust in.

2010
01:04:20.949 --> 01:04:23.907
We’re receiving word that
the terrorist Ryan McGregor,

2011
01:04:23.907 --> 01:04:27.616
otherwise known as
The Detonator of Demwa, has died.

2012
01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:30.782
This is breaking news
just coming in...

2013
01:04:30.782 --> 01:04:33.241
CUP SHATI’ERS
..so details are scarce
at the moment.

2014
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:35.907
We will bring you more updates
as soon as we have more information.

2015
01:04:35.907 --> 01:04:37.657
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

2016
01:04:47.407 --> 01:04:49.616
VOICE ON TV BECOMES DISTANT

2017
01:04:51.032 --> 01:04:52.657
Mama, are you 0K?
