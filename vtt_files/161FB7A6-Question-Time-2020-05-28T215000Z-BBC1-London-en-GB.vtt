SCREAMING

3
00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:13.000
It’s been a bit much lately,
what with Dad suddenly dying

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.958
and finding out
he had a secret love child.

5
00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:18.166
Oh, come here.
You could be identical twins!

6
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.041
Dad had an affair. Not great, but
because of it, you’ve got a sister.

7
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.208
You’ve got me.

8
00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:24.791
Your dad was my sexual zenith.

9
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.500
That man is dead to me.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.833
He’s dead to all of us!

11
00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:28.875
He’s dead!

Let’s start with our first question

52
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.791
Let’s start with our first question
from Alison Goldie. Good evening,

53
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.833
from Alison Goldie. Good evening,
Fiona, good evening, panel. Given

54
00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:53.708
Fiona, good evening, panel. Given
the success of track and trace, we

55
00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:54.875
the success of track and trace, we
rely significantly on the

56
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:59.791
rely significantly on the
Government’s

57
00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:01.958
Government’s trust and the rules,

58
00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:02.333
Government’s trust and the mles,
has this

59
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.333
Government’s trust and the rules,
has this been undermined in any way

60
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.375
has this been undermined in any way
by the events of this last week? It

61
00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:07.875
by the events of this last week? It
feels like we have done nothing else

62
00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.208
feels like we have done nothing else
but talk about the events of last

63
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:11.875
but talk about the events of last
week, of course Dominic Cummings.

64
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.916
week, of course Dominic Cummings.
Ian Murray. Thank you for the

65
00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:20.000
Ian Murray. Thank you for the
question, Alison, it gets to the nub

66
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.041
question, Alison, it gets to the nub
of how we get out of this epidemic,

67
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.750
of how we get out of this epidemic,
test, trace and isolate is the only

68
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.000
test, trace and isolate is the only
“Y

69
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.416
test, trace and isolate is the only
way forward ,

70
00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.583
test, trace and isolate is the only
way forward, and in the last week,

71
00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.250
way forward, and in the last week,
with the saga we have had with the

72
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.125
with the saga we have had with the
Prime Minister, the Government, his

73
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.416
Prime Minister, the Government, his
integrity in tatters, we have seen

74
00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:34.958
integrity in tatters, we have seen
it is one rule for the Prime

75
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:35.000
it is one mle for the Prime
Minister

76
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.333
it is one rule for the Prime
Minister and his team,

77
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:36.791
it is one rule for the Prime
Ministerand his team, and

78
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:37.583
it is one rule for the Prime
Minister and his team, and one rule

79
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:38.333
Minister and his team, and one mle
for the public.

80
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.291
Minister and his team, and one rule
for the public. We need every single

81
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:41.333
for the public. We need every single
member of the public to be

82
00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.541
member of the public to be
absolutely in touch with these rules

83
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:44.041
absolutely in touch with these mles
and abiding

84
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:45.083
absolutely in touch with these rules
and abiding by them, otherwise we

85
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.666
and abiding by them, otherwise we
will never get to the end of this

86
00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:49.666
will never get to the end of this
pandemic. The word trust, I think it

87
00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:54.375
pandemic. The word trust, I think it
should be called tax, test, trace,

88
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:54.541
should be rallad tax, test, trace,
isolate

89
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:55.708
should be called tax, test, trace,
isolate and trust. The Scottish

90
00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:57.708
isolate and trust. The Scottish
Government has a big question to

91
00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.083
Government has a big question to
answer, because if you go back to

92
00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.416
answer, because if you go back to
the very start of this pandemic in

93
00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:05.208
the very start of this pandemic in
Edinburgh, at a conference in a city

94
00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.583
Edinburgh, at a conference in a city
centre hotel, and the public were

95
00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.875
centre hotel, and the public were
not told about that. The reason it

96
00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:10.291
not told about that. The reason it
is such a difficult story for the

97
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.416
is such a difficult story for the
Scottish Government is twofold, one,

98
00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:14.166
Scottish Government is twofold, one,
you need the public to be involved

99
00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:16.458
you need the public to be involved
in this so that they can be used to

100
00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:17.250
in this so that they ran be used to
help track and

101
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.125
in this so that they can be used to
help track and trace the people who

102
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:18.375
help track and trace the peopla who
have

103
00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:20.000
help track and trace the people who
have potentially been infected, they

104
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.916
have potentially been infected, they
need to trust in the system.

105
00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:26.250
And secondly, you need that trust
from the public so you can use them

106
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.583
to isolate and you can also use them
to make their own choices about

107
00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:31.250
whether or not they
see family members.

108
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.416
So trust is the nub of how
a track and trace system works.

109
00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:36.583
But given how critical you are
of Dominic Cummings,

110
00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:39.416
saying it’s one rule for him and one
rule for everybody else,

111
00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.333
why didn’t Labour ask for him to go?

112
00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.000
Well, Keir Starmer said very
clearly, if he was Prime Minister,

113
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.166
he would have sacked him...

114
00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.333
Yes, but he didn’tjoin the other
parties in asking him to go.

115
00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:50.750
Well, I think when the Conservatives
are tearing themselves apart

116
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.916
over this kinds of issue,
there’s now over 60

117
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.041
Conservative MPs who’ve publicly
said that he should go,

118
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:57.166
there’s over 70 that have e—mailed
back their constituents,

119
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.583
of which we’ve all had thousands
of e—mails about this.

120
00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:02.500
The public are incredibly angry,
and it goes back to Douglas Ross,

121
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.416
thejunior Scotland Office minister
resigned this week,

122
00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:07.250
and he said in his letter,
and I think this is crucial,

123
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.416
that many of the public have
made huge sacrifices,

124
00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:12.083
including not being able to hold
the hand of loved ones

125
00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:15.000
when they’re dying, and how could he
possibly say to his constituents

126
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.125
that they were wrong
and Dominic Cummings was right?

127
00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:19.750
And I think that sums this
issue up in a sentence.

128
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.416
Layla, can I ask you,
as the sort of scientific voice

129
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.500
on our panel here this evening,
do you feel that compliance may have

130
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.958
been undermined by the events
of the last few days?

131
00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.625
Well, it’s interesting, isn’t it?

132
00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:32.875
Because it’s not exactly
about what Dominic Cummings

133
00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:36.375
did or he didn’t do —
the question is really

134
00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:39.958
about what is the impact of that.

135
00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.041
And what we’ve heard from our
members who are CEOs of hospitals,

136
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:47.250
GPs, all across the health system,
people are worried

137
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.041
that public health messages
are being undermined.

138
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:53.000
They’re already hearing
that people are making decisions

139
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.291
they might not have otherwise made,
and that’s really worrying,

140
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:00.583
because in orderfor these public
measures, whether lockdown,

141
00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:04.791
test, track and trace,
any of these things to work,

142
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.458
we need to have a really clear
message that isn’t open

143
00:06:07.458 --> 00:06:10.375
to too much interpretation
and discretion.

144
00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:12.625
And we need to have
this public feeling that

145
00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:17.000
we’re all in it together.

146
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.583
And I think that for those reasons,
one of the hospital CEOs

147
00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:23.458
said to us recently that this
could actually be one of

148
00:06:23.458 --> 00:06:26.541
the biggest risks to public health
since lockdown began.

149
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.875
So I think that all of these
are key considerations

150
00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.375
as we think about what next.

151
00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:34.458
Alison, could I come back to you?

152
00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.916
Has it had any impact
on whether you will be

153
00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:40.125
more or less compliant,
as we’re going into test,

154
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:43.625
track, or test and protect,
or test and isolate now?

155
00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:46.208
Well, no, from a personal level,
I would follow the guidelines.

156
00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:48.375
I think I’ve got enough
integrity to do that.

157
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:53.416
But I do think that it will have
an impact on some people

158
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:58.208
who are just fed up with the whole
idea that someone can get away

159
00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:02.958
with something when the rest
are not supposed to.

160
00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.333
Anyone on the panel think
actually it really won’t make

161
00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:08.750
that much of a difference,
that people will still do

162
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.791
what they feel they need to do
in the current circumstances?

163
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:14.791
This is deeply unscientific poll.

164
00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:17.083
None of you are
putting your hands up.

165
00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.750
Ah, yes, Eileen.

166
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.416
Hi, Fiona, I believe that
it undermines the message,

167
00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:26.791
like Alison said,
but had it been an MP,

168
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:31.833
he wouldn’t have got away with it.

169
00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:35.791
If it was anyone else with it,
they wouldn’t have got away with it.

170
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.416
The fact that this person
is so close and so influential

171
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.333
to Borisjohnson,
that’s what rocks my confidence.

172
00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.750
What I’m asking you
is whether or not you think

173
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.916
it’ll make any difference in terms
of compliance generally.

174
00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:46.541
Yes, it will.

175
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:50.250
Like Alison said, the people
with integrity out there,

176
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.125
there’s people who do the right
thing for society, for their family.

177
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:54.916
There’s other people,
like Dominic Cummings,

178
00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:59.333
looks for the loophole
and looks for the cheap way.

179
00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:02.125
You’re cheating society
by doing this.

180
00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:04.958
Ultimately, you’re
putting lives at risk.

181
00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:09.791
Behaviour breeds behaviour,

182
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:14.083
especially with someone
so influential.

183
00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:19.083
Matthew, let’s hearfrom you.

184
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:23.208
Just on that point, Fiona,
Ithink, you know,

185
00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.625
with all due respect,
Ian, to what you’ve said there,

186
00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.500
I mean, if I’m not mistaken,
Stephen Kenny took it upon himself

187
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.916
to go to his father’s place
to sing Happy Birthday.

188
00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:33.541
I mean, he did it quite blatantly
as well, quite literally

189
00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:35.708
in front of the cameras.
So I think this...

190
00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:38.083
I mean, infairness,
he said he was dropping off

191
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:40.000
essential shopping for them
that they couldn’t get,

192
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.708
that’s what he said at the time.

193
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:44.583
Yes, but it wasn’t done in an overly
discreet fashion, you know,

194
00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:46.500
the filming of what happened
there as such.

195
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.125
And I don’t have any political
allegiance one way or another,

196
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.791
but I think the public,
from what I can sense anyway,

197
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:54.416
people I know are probably
just a little bit fed up

198
00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:57.875
with the politicising
of things as well.

199
00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.750
All we’re after is just,
if we are all in it together,

200
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.958
like the slogan says,
that indeed those people in

201
00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.000
public life, like it or loathe it,
you have to adhere to that,

202
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.958
probably to a greater
extent than the general

203
00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:12.958
populace because it comes
with the territory, unfortunately.

204
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.875
Alex Massie.

205
00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:20.000
Yes, I mean, look, Ithink...

206
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.166
There were an awful lot of people
all across the United Kingdom who,

207
00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.791
even if they haven’t necessarily
voted for BorisJohnson

208
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:28.208
or thought much of him,
previously wished him well,

209
00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.875
they recognised it was important
the Government had a grip on

210
00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:35.875
this crisis, rose to the challenge,
rose to the occasion.

211
00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.125
And I think those sentiments
were reinforced, obviously,

212
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:43.125
when the Prime Minister
fell ill himself.

213
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.166
And the events of the last week,
I think, has enormously dented

214
00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:51.708
public confidence in
the UK Government’s ability

215
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.625
to handle this crisis,
because people have seen,

216
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:56.500
and they have understood, and it’s
been based on their own experience

217
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.666
and the difference between the way
they behaved and the way

218
00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.583
that, in this instance,
Dominic Cummings has behaved,

219
00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:04.666
and they can tell the difference
between these two things.

220
00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:07.250
Plenty of people, you know, you can
sympathise with the predicament

221
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.416
in which Dominic Cummings
and his family found themselves,

222
00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:12.166
while recognising at the same time
that many, many other people,

223
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:15.958
hundreds of thousands,
perhaps millions of people,

224
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.833
have faced comparable situations
and they have obeyed

225
00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:19.500
the Government advice,
followed the Government advice

226
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.708
and stayed at home.

227
00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.333
And it’s not unreasonable to
expect people at the highest levels

228
00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:26.000
of government to do likewise.

229
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.250
And, you know, Ialso do
think that this scandal,

230
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.541
it has become a scandal,
it started as a story,

231
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:37.083
but the Government’s reaction to it
has turned into a scandal,

232
00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:39.250
it has fatally wounded
a lot of the messaging

233
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.625
that is out there at the moment.

234
00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:46.250
It is entirely understandable
in some ways that people will take

235
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.958
the message that if there is one
rule for government advisers

236
00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.875
and a different rule
for the general public,

237
00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.250
that they will take the view

238
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.166
that they will
do their own thing too,

239
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.875
regardless of what
the official advice says.

240
00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:58.625
And the Government’s
arrogant dismissal of this,

241
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.791
the suggestion that
it isn’t a story at all

242
00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:05.833
and that it’s time to move on,
won’t do.

243
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:09.958
I mean, you know, as as my colleague
Esther Webber said in the Times

244
00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.791
the other day, you know,
the problem with the "move on" idea

245
00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:14.708
is that the general public
isn’t yet convinced

246
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:18.958
that moving on
is an essentialjourney.

247
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.000
Keith, you’ve got your hand up.

248
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.958
Yeah, I mean, I’m going
to disappoint Alex here by saying,

249
00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:28.000
yeah, I think we should do
exactly that, move on.

250
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.208
I mean, for you political
commentators and members

251
00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:33.666
of the opposition party,
the Dominic Cummings story must be

252
00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:35.583
Christmas, your birthday,
new year rolled into one,

253
00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.125
you must be loving it.

254
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:39.750
I mean, Emily Maitlis has
had to take the day off

255
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.125
because of over excitement.

256
00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:44.083
I mean, yeah, move on.

257
00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:48.708
I can’t be bothered,
I’ve got a mind of my mind,

258
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.625
a mind of my own, you know,
I know what to do

259
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:52.791
and what not to do.

260
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:54.458
What Dominic Cummings
does or doesn’t do

261
00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:56.125
has no impact on me at all.

262
00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:58.041
And I’m more interested
in whether there’s self—raising

263
00:11:58.041 --> 00:12:00.291
flour and eggs on the supermarket
shelf than listening

264
00:12:00.291 --> 00:12:02.666
to Dominic Cummings stories.

265
00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:06.166
50, Alex, yeah, let’s move on.

266
00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:09.958
Well, this will be music
to your ears, Helen.

267
00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.083
Yeah, and Keith’s position
is more what I’m beginning

268
00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.875
to hear coming through,
that people feel that

269
00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.250
there’s been a lot of talk
about what Dominic Cummings

270
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.291
did or didn’t do.

271
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:21.416
But actually what really matters
is us having the pandemic under

272
00:12:21.416 --> 00:12:26.458
control and being able to get back
to life that much nearer to...

273
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:30.291
Is that what your constituents
were saying to you

274
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.750
when it first broke, this story?

275
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.666
Well, of course, I’ve received
e—mails from constituents,

276
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:36.750
as every MP has, and Ian has done
so, and I’ve received emails

277
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.916
from constituents who talk
about some of the sacrifices

278
00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:43.000
they’ve made and things that
they have missed out on.

279
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.458
And I don’t think
we should suggest for a moment

280
00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:51.416
that lockdown is anything
other than very hard.

281
00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:53.166
But that’s why what’s
really important

282
00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:56.000
is that we now have the infection
rate under control and falling,

283
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.250
and that we’re in a position to
ease some of the lockdown measures

284
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.083
and launching the NHS Test
and Trace, as referred to by Alison,

285
00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:08.083
because that is so important
to continuing to keep under control.

286
00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:13.750
And are you worried
that people may now...

287
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.416
Some will take the view
of Keith, you know,

288
00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:20.291
just move on and that’s it,
it’s over, I won’t talk about it

289
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.166
any more, and I’m sure
you won’t be alone in that, Keith.

290
00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:25.791
I mean, others might be thinking,
well, are there any loopholes

291
00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:28.708
here in this new system that we’re
all being asked in England

292
00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:31.791
and in Scotland to adopt from today
in terms of test and protect,

293
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:32.875
or test and isolate?

294
00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:35.500
Because if there are any loopholes
and it appears there were

295
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.333
a few loopholes when it came
to going all the way up

296
00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:41.750
to County Durham when we all thought
we might have to stay at home,

297
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.416
in fact, if there are any loopholes,

298
00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:46.250
should we hear about them now
rather than perhaps find out later?

299
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.750
Well, what we’ve seen so far

300
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.416
is people really are consciously
following the guidance.

301
00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:54.333
And in fact, the guidance
has included recognising

302
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:57.416
that some situations will
be more difficult.

303
00:13:57.416 --> 00:14:01.041
For instance,
if you’re looking after somebody

304
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.625
who’s particularly vulnerable,
you have a childcare situation...

305
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.791
So if you have a childcare
situation, then, Helen,

306
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.416
since you mentioned it,
if you have a problem with childcare

307
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:11.291
and you happen to be one
of the people who is identified

308
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:13.958
as someone that has to stay
at home for two weeks,

309
00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.916
you may not necessarily have to do.

310
00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:19.916
You clearly have to make sure
that your child is safe,

311
00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:22.041
as any parent should do so.
But for instance...

312
00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:25.416
So if you have to leave home
to do that, even if you’ve been

313
00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:28.083
told to self—isolate,
you can do that?

314
00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:31.208
Well, if you’re contacted
because you’re a contact of somebody

315
00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.125
who’s got symptoms and told
to isolate home,

316
00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:35.583
you should be able
to do so with your child.

317
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.000
And everyone will
have their scenarios.

318
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But no, just to be clear,
because it is important,

319
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:50.208
because we all to have to adjust to
this now, this new system.

320
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:53.041
So if you are told to self—isolate
at home for two weeks,

321
00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:55.708
either because you have symptoms
or you’ve been in close contact,

322
00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:58.083
with someone has symptoms,
but you have problems with that

323
00:14:58.083 --> 00:15:00.250
and you find that difficult
because of childcare issues,

324
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.416
you can behave otherwise,
you don’t have to self—isolate?

325
00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:03.666
You should follow the guidance.

326
00:15:03.666 --> 00:15:06.541
But I don’t think anyone would
suggest that you should do that,

327
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:08.875
that you should have a child
in an unsafe situation.

328
00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.625
So follow the guidance
unless you can’t.

329
00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.791
No, that’s not what I’m
saying, actually, at all.

330
00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:14.708
You should absolutely...
You should follow the guidance.

331
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:16.875
And that’s been the case
all the way through.

332
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:20.208
People should follow the guidance.
But you’re saying unless...

333
00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:22.875
The guidance has always said
that safety would be a factor

334
00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:26.000
and you should be clearly
a responsible parent.

335
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.625
But I mean, I think what’s really
important is that people

336
00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:30.291
follow the guidance,
and through doing that,

337
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:32.958
that’s how we manage to keep
the infection rate under control,

338
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.500
and so life can get back to normal,
or closer to normal,

339
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.375
which would be so much
better for everybody.

340
00:15:40.375 --> 00:15:41.583
Can I say to Keith...?

341
00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:42.625
Briefly.

342
00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:45.250
Keith is partially right,
But why we haven’t moved

343
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.416
on is because there’s been no
apology, no contrition,

344
00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:50.291
and the doubling down on saying that
you can drive 60 miles

345
00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:51.583
to test your eyesight.

346
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.958
And Michael Gove’s touring
television studios to say that’s

347
00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.833
allowable because he was preparing
to go back to work is treating

348
00:15:56.833 --> 00:15:58.750
the public like fools,
And that’s why people

349
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:04.875
haven’t moved on.

350
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.333
John Swinney.

351
00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:11.416
I think the whole issue for me comes
down to the point that

352
00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:14.666
when Dominic Cummings made this
journey, everybody was told you’ve

353
00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:17.958
got to stay at home,
and the reasons why you were able

354
00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.375
to leave home were really,
really, really limited.

355
00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:25.000
And quite clearly Dominic Cummings
broke those rules to make

356
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.708
the journey that he made,
and Ian Murray is absolutely right —

357
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:31.458
the ludicrous explanation
that the thing you do when you’re

358
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:34.083
worried about your eyesight
is drive your car for 60 miles

359
00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:39.125
is just beyond credibility.

360
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:43.416
So the worry I have about all
of this is that it has that effect

361
00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:46.333
that you’ve talked about,
that Alison talked about in her

362
00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:48.500
question, that it essentially
undermines public confidence

363
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.083
and public compliance.

364
00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:54.750
This has been a really
difficult pandemic for any

365
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.916
government to handle —
it’s a challenge for us

366
00:16:56.916 --> 00:17:00.083
in the Scottish Government.

367
00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:03.000
But we saw polling information this
week which demonstrated very,

368
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.541
very high levels of public trust
and confidence in the actions

369
00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:11.208
of the Scottish Government in how
we have handled this crisis.

370
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:13.458
Now, that doesn’t mean
there’s not been hardship.

371
00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:16.583
It doesn’t mean that there’s not
been suffering, but it means we’ve

372
00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:19.833
communicated clearly.

373
00:17:19.833 --> 00:17:22.541
We’ve had tremendous consent
from members of the public

374
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:27.541
to the measures that we’ve had
to regrettably put in place.

375
00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:32.000
And I worry that the Dominic
Cummings fiasco and the arrogance

376
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.500
that’s been demonstrated
by the Prime Minister

377
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.500
and by Dominic Cummings
and by all of the members,

378
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.791
of the Cabinet in the way that
they’ve expected us all to...

379
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:43.958
John, sorry to interrupt,
but it’s worth pointing out,

380
00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.708
isn’t it, that when there
was a similar 3 similar issue

381
00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:50.583
in Scotland, when the chief medical
officer who visited her second home,

382
00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:52.625
Caroline Calderwood,
Nicola Sturgeon did let her go,

383
00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.250
but initially did try to hang
onto her, as BorisJohnson

384
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.875
is hanging onto Dominic Cummings.

385
00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:01.375
Well, when the story
about Catherine Calderwood broke,

386
00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:02.875
the first thing that
Catherine Calderwood

387
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:06.750
did was apologise.

388
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.041
She accepted that she had made
a mistake, and the First Minister

389
00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:13.208
said that Catherine Calderwood had
an important contribution to make

390
00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:15.125
to the Scottish Government
about the clinical advice

391
00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:19.041
that we required.

392
00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:23.500
But the First Minister accepted,
as did Catherine Calderwood,

393
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.875
that the very act of her not
following the rules that she had set

394
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:27.958
out undermined those rules.

395
00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.500
So she resigned within 2A hours.

396
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.666
Now, that was...

397
00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:32.291
So what was different here?

398
00:18:32.291 --> 00:18:36.125
Catherine Calderwood apologised.

399
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:40.083
She accepted there was a potential
damage to public consent

400
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:44.000
and participation, and she resigned,
and she did so with dignity.

401
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.875
Dominic Cummings and BorisJohnson
have behaved with arroagance

402
00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:51.375
and with disrespect to the public,
and they have insulted so many

403
00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.750
members of the public who have
suffered so many things,

404
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.958
missed out on critical moments...

405
00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:59.916
0K, 0K...

406
00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:02.833
..the life journey of their loved
ones, and that should be confronted.

407
00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:05.416
OK, I think it’ll keep Keith happy,
we’re going to move

408
00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.458
on from Dominic Cummings.

409
00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:11.500
Let’s hear a question
from Matthew, Matthew Denne.

410
00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:16.875
Track and Trace appears to be
encountering delay issues

411
00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:19.750
in the rolling out process,
both north and south of the border.

412
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.375
Why is it that other nations around
the world have managed

413
00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:23.416
to expedite these processes?

414
00:19:23.416 --> 00:19:27.416
And could the Scottish and the UK
governments look to adapt

415
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.333
using their successes rather
than too much reinventing

416
00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.375
of the wheel?

417
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:35.375
Are you referring to things
like the app, for example, Matthew?

418
00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:38.833
There are apps already
being used in Germany,

419
00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:41.416
South Korea and other countries,
for example, whereas we are still

420
00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:42.666
trying to get ours going.

421
00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:44.000
Is that what you mean?

422
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.375
Yeah, Ithink, you know,
most reasonable people would concede

423
00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:51.250
the Asian countries in particular,
whether it was swine flu or Sars,

424
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.916
etc, you know, they’re probably
ahead of the curve because they’ve

425
00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:54.958
gone through pandemics previously.

426
00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.625
So they’ve been able
to adapt technology.

427
00:19:56.625 --> 00:20:00.958
But there’s plenty
of other examples.

428
00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:04.916
Dare I say Australia,
you know, one of the ones

429
00:20:04.916 --> 00:20:07.541
where they’ve been able to,
you know, roll out this programme

430
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:12.375
of track and trace with great speed
from effectively ground zero.

431
00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:14.833
And when the World Health
Organization said at the start

432
00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:18.708
the global pandemic,
we need a joined up approach

433
00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:21.583
between nations, it almost feels
like the UK government,

434
00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:24.416
reminds me of my father
when I was little, and you’d get

435
00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:26.875
lost and he’d never ask
for directions because he had

436
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:29.708
a superiority complex about it.

437
00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:33.166
And it just feels that way
with the UK at the moment.

438
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:36.791
You know, don’t be afraid to ask
for a bit of help rather than trying

439
00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:38.500
to go off on your own tangent.

440
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.958
Well, Helen, let’s start with you.

441
00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:42.083
Let me just ask about
the app actually, first.

442
00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:45.041
Where are we with this app?

443
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:47.916
We know that the app will be brought
forwards in due course.

444
00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:51.375
But the system that we have got
in place today is drawing

445
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:56.333
on over 25,000 callers
who will be implementing...

446
00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.791
Because we were told
by Matthew Hancock that the app

447
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:02.666
was incredibly important
and we don’t have it.

448
00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:04.833
So is itjust that
it is not working?

449
00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:05.875
What’s happening with it?

450
00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:08.333
Just update us.

451
00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:11.500
So the app will support us as we go
further down the path.

452
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.166
But the important thing is that
we’ve got to a point...

453
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:19.291
I’m just trying to find out where
we are with the app because it is...

454
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:20.333
Is it not working?

455
00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:21.375
Are there technical problems?

456
00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:22.458
Just fill us in.

457
00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:27.083
I’m not personally
working on the app.

458
00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:29.750
But the important thing
is we have a system in place

459
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.333
which we’ve been able to launch
today, which means that it

460
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:36.666
will support some of the easing
of lockdown measures.

461
00:21:36.666 --> 00:21:39.833
And we have actually to pick up,
when we do look at overseas

462
00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:42.958
and what other countries are doing,
we do absolutely look to make sure

463
00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:47.000
that we draw on the best
of what you see elsewhere.

464
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.583
And we have also got to a point,
though, that we can launch the NHS

465
00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:53.750
Test and Trace system because we’ve
now got the number of cases and

466
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.958
the infection rate under control.

467
00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.583
So we’re actually in a position
that it will really work,

468
00:21:57.583 --> 00:21:59.500
to do the contact tracing
and the isolating.

469
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.916
And then, because we’re
all getting to grips with how

470
00:22:01.916 --> 00:22:04.166
this is going to work.

471
00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:09.000
So if we develop symptoms,
we contact one of these tracers,

472
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
I’m not sure who we contact
actually, but we contact somebody.

473
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:17.458
So if you develop symptoms,
you should go home and isolate

474
00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:20.291
and then you should order a test
which you can do online

475
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:23.000
or by phoning 119.

476
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.625
So you inform 119 that you think
you might have symptoms

477
00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:29.000
and you ask for a test.

478
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.625
And then, if you test positive,
you are asked to then

479
00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:33.750
supply details of who you’ve been
in contact with.

480
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.416
Correct.

481
00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:38.083
But what do you, without the app?

482
00:22:38.083 --> 00:22:41.000
What do you do about all the people
you’ve been in contact

483
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.416
with when you don’t know their name,
their email address,

484
00:22:43.416 --> 00:22:44.458
their phone number?

485
00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:45.666
How’s that going to work?

486
00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:48.791
So people who you were on public
transport with or in the shop

487
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:49.791
with, the shopkeeper.

488
00:22:49.791 --> 00:22:52.000
So this goes hand in hand
with social distancing.

489
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.375
So for instance, if you’ve been
keeping a social distance

490
00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:58.958
and being two metres apart,
that wouldn’t count as a contact.

491
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.625
No, but for people where you have
been closer, you know,

492
00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:04.458
either in your workplace or perhaps
because you go on public transport,

493
00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:07.083
without the app, how
are you going to know who these

494
00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:09.708
people are, the people that we don’t
have the details for?

495
00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:12.125
It’s important when you’re out
and about that you’re following

496
00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:13.166
the social distancing rules...

497
00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:15.083
But sometimes, sometimes
as the government has accepted,

498
00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:17.000
it’s not always going to be
possible, particularly

499
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.041
in a work environment.

500
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:21.125
So when you don’t necessarily know
all the people you’ve been in closer

501
00:23:21.125 --> 00:23:23.041
than two—metre contact with,
without the app, how

502
00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:24.291
you’re going to find them?

503
00:23:24.291 --> 00:23:27.375
Well, I think you’ll find a lot
of people will know people that

504
00:23:27.375 --> 00:23:28.875
they’ve spent sustained,
close contact with.

505
00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:30.041
You would know about that.

506
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:32.708
And that’s what you will talk
through with the contact tracers

507
00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:35.583
so that they can then contact them
and this is a system,

508
00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:38.708
this is a known way of dealing
with a pandemic and controlling it.

509
00:23:38.708 --> 00:23:40.125
So, we’re not making this up.

510
00:23:40.125 --> 00:23:42.291
This is a system
that is known to work.

511
00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:45.125
Are we ready, Layla?

512
00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:50.166
Well, it sounds as though we’re
getting there with the human contact

513
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.833
tracers, as has been discussed.

514
00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:55.333
Clearly, it’s only just launched.

515
00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:58.750
There are going to be operational
issues as it starts to bed in.

516
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.375
Hang on, we were told
it was going be world beating

517
00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:05.708
on Monday by the Prime Minister.

518
00:24:05.708 --> 00:24:09.041
Well, I don’t think that anyone
in the NHS needs it to be world

519
00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.000
beating so much as just
really, really effective.

520
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.416
And that’s what we’re hoping for.

521
00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:16.833
And at the moment,
it’s just kicked off.

522
00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:20.166
We don’t yet know what it’s going be
like, but we are strongly hoping

523
00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:23.041
that this is going to be a really
effective way of working.

524
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:25.708
The app question is interesting
because of course, we were promised

525
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:30.708
that the app would be here as part
of that system.

526
00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:36.541
And in some ways we don’t need to be
really distressed that it’s

527
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:39.416
not there on day one because it’s
only part of the system.

528
00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:41.333
It’s not the main
part of the system.

529
00:24:41.333 --> 00:24:42.416
It’s an adjunct.

530
00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:46.416
It will be something that
will improve our ability to find

531
00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:49.291
people who are at risk and make sure
that they’re able to

532
00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:52.791
quarantine and be safe.

533
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:56.125
But I think that this is really more
of a challenge that we keep

534
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:58.291
on being promised things
are going to be here

535
00:24:58.291 --> 00:24:59.583
and then they’re not.

536
00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:02.416
And it’s part of what I was saying
before about just eroding

537
00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:05.000
people’s confidence.

538
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.291
The NHS has had lots
of disappointments whether they’ve

539
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.416
been you know, they’ve been promised
PPE coming on a plane from Turkey

540
00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:13.833
and then it hasn’t come
or they’ve been promised PPE

541
00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:15.000
that was going to work.

542
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.666
And then suddenly it’s
substandard in some way.

543
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:21.666
There’s lots of expectations that
are raised and then they’re dashed.

544
00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:25.791
And I think that what we’re hearing
from health leaders is,

545
00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:27.958
promise things that you’re able
to deliver when you’re

546
00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:29.333
able to deliver them.

547
00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:32.458
And that will really help to build
staff confidence and help to build

548
00:25:32.458 --> 00:25:35.916
patient confidence.

549
00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:38.125
Ellen, you wanted to come in.

550
00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:40.208
Yes.

551
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:45.000
Just taking up on that last point
as well, there is a huge disconnect

552
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.625
between what we hear on the daily
briefings and the reality

553
00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:52.250
and the implementation of these
policies on the ground,

554
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.416
and having that confidence
in the infrastructure can deliver

555
00:25:54.416 --> 00:25:57.708
what we’re being promised.

556
00:25:57.708 --> 00:26:01.833
And it’s really incomprehensible why
the UK was so unprepared.

557
00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:05.541
I mean, countries like Turkey have
been testing and tracking

558
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:10.500
since the start with a relatively
low death toll.

559
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.125
And indeed, as you were saying
in the panel, we were told we’d get

560
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:17.041
a world heating system.

561
00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:20.375
But what’s being rolled out now
is only the basics of what we should

562
00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:21.416
have expected weeks ago.

563
00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:25.000
We’re not testing
asymptomatic cases.

564
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.833
Tests are only available online.

565
00:26:26.833 --> 00:26:31.791
This should be available locally,
I would have thought.

566
00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:33.958
And itjust appears that
once again, the world

567
00:26:33.958 --> 00:26:35.333
has beaten us to it.

568
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:40.208
Sean.

569
00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:44.041
I’m just wondering how
useful this app will be.

570
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:46.500
Dr Hannah Fry said in
2017 in a BBC pandemic,

571
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.083
the biggest citizen experiment,
she did of its kind,

572
00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:54.166
for the next pandemic like this,
most of the things about coming out

573
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:57.083
from that where about access
to Wi—Fi, having the money to pay

574
00:26:57.083 --> 00:26:59.958
for Wi—Fi, Wi—Fi in your home,
whether you have a phone that

575
00:26:59.958 --> 00:27:03.333
would be able to have this app
and you’d be able to download it.

576
00:27:03.333 --> 00:27:06.958
My mum’s over 70 and I don’t know
if she would be able to navigate

577
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.000
something like that.

578
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.375
David?

579
00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:14.541
Layla, I think you were being too
kind there and being very easy

580
00:27:14.541 --> 00:27:15.958
on the Conservatives
with your comment.

581
00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:20.250
Because the First Minister today,
of Scotland, she said,

582
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.875
she was reticent to announce
the move from lockdown that we’re

583
00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:24.708
moving into in Scotland now.

584
00:27:24.708 --> 00:27:28.125
And I understand where she’s coming
from, because we’ve got to a point

585
00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:33.125
now where for me personally,
I have a lot more questions.

586
00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:36.416
I may not be her biggest fan,
but coming out of every day

587
00:27:36.416 --> 00:27:39.083
and giving us the briefings she’s
given us, and then for

588
00:27:39.083 --> 00:27:43.208
the Westminster parliament to do
what’s happened over the last few

589
00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:47.375
weeks, and that mistrust.

590
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:50.041
Nobody’s going to tell me that,
I don’t want to talk

591
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:51.958
about the Cummings incident,
the height of government,

592
00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:53.875
the power they’ve got,
things they could do,

593
00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:55.541
people could get things done.

594
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:57.666
It’s not like anything else
that’s ever happened.

595
00:27:57.666 --> 00:28:00.416
This pandemic is hitting at all,
hitting us all hard.

596
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:05.458
The trust is gone.

597
00:28:05.541 --> 00:28:08.375
And I don’t understand how
you could sit there and turn around

598
00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:11.541
and say to us that we’ve got,
to get the pandemic in control...

599
00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:14.625
To get the pandemic under control,
you need the public on your side.

600
00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:17.041
And that’s not what we’ve seen
from the Westminster government.

601
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:20.750
Ruth.

602
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.458
Hi, thank you, Fiona.

603
00:28:25.458 --> 00:28:28.375
My question is, this track and trace
system, what happens if nobody

604
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:30.166
volunteers themselves?

605
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:33.125
My understanding is it’s
a voluntary system.

606
00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:35.583
What happens if people don’t
give their name, for example?

607
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:36.875
What happens in that situation?

608
00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:41.875
How is that going to be handled?

609
00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:43.500
I mean, John Swinney,

610
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.291
it’s an interesting point,
actually, because obviously,

611
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:49.375
if you do put yourself forward,
A, if you suggest that

612
00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:53.000
you’ve got symptoms,
you realise you’re going to be

613
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.666
in quarantine for
the next two weeks,

614
00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:57.041
and also, all the other people that
you mentioned you’ve

615
00:28:57.041 --> 00:28:59.500
been in contact with,
you know, for a sustained period

616
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.291
of time or less than two metres,
you’re effectively dobbing them in,

617
00:29:02.291 --> 00:29:05.208
if you like, and they’re going
to have to self—isolate as well.

618
00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:07.375
So what, to Ruth’s point,
because obviously you’ve got

619
00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:09.291
the same issue in Scotland
as in England,

620
00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:11.000
what if people don’t
put themselves forward?

621
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.375
I think this is the link
to the first question

622
00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:14.375
that we’ve just had.

623
00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:16.791
The recent why we’ve been successful
in reducing the prevalence

624
00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:19.000
of coronavirus is because
of massive volumes of public

625
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.625
participation and compliance.

626
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:24.625
And the same applies
to the track, trace,

627
00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.125
isolate and support strategy,
test and protect, that we’re

628
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:30.333
putting out in Scotland.

629
00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:33.708
It relies on people coming forward
where they have symptoms, indicating

630
00:29:33.708 --> 00:29:37.041
that they have those symptoms.

631
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:40.833
And then for us pursuing
the contacts, obviously they’ll be

632
00:29:40.833 --> 00:29:43.000
privacy applied to essentially
the source of the virus

633
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.125
that’s been drawn to the attention
of other individuals.

634
00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:49.625
But it fundamentally relies
on public participation,

635
00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:54.625
public trust and public confidence.

636
00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:57.791
And that’s why I really appreciate
the comments that David made

637
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:00.125
about how the First Minister has
communicated about the challenges

638
00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:03.708
that are inherent in
handling a pandemic.

639
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:07.375
And we need to have that similar
level of communication and consent

640
00:30:07.375 --> 00:30:12.416
from members of the public,
in wrestling with the contact

641
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.875
tracing strategy.

642
00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:19.833
It is a bit unfair to lay
absolutely everything

643
00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:21.958
and Dominic Cummings’ door.

644
00:30:21.958 --> 00:30:24.083
I’m no apologist, but nonetheless,
there’ll be other factors

645
00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:26.750
that might influence whether people
want to comply in terms of

646
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.833
can they afford to take the time off
work, that kind of thing.

647
00:30:29.833 --> 00:30:32.250
Alex, Matthew’s question
is why is it that other nations

648
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.666
have managed to do this faster?

649
00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:36.083
And could the Scottish and UK
governments have learned anything

650
00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:38.416
from these and therefore done
it faster ourselves?

651
00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:40.916
Well, I think on the
second part of that,

652
00:30:40.916 --> 00:30:43.083
the obvious answer has to be yes.

653
00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:46.166
And this is one of the many,
many things that will be considered

654
00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:51.166
by the inevitable series
of public inquiries

655
00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:54.916
that will follow the eventual
conclusion of this emergency.

656
00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:58.583
You know, one of the ironies
here is that, you know,

657
00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:02.625
one of the fiercest critics
of what you might term

658
00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:05.500
the dysfunction of the British state
or the Whitehall apparatus is one

659
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.541
Dominic Cummings.

660
00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:08.791
He thinks that we need
to fundamentally rethink, reimagine,

661
00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:13.791
reorganise the entire
business of government.

662
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.625
I happen to think
that some of his diagnosis

663
00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:20.208
is quite persuasive.

664
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:23.833
He is, of course, now in a position
to do something about it.

665
00:31:23.833 --> 00:31:26.041
And he’s discovering that curing
something is rather more

666
00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:29.541
difficult than diagnosing it.

667
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:32.416
And I think that that is something
that is a long—term challenge

668
00:31:32.416 --> 00:31:33.458
for the British state.

669
00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:36.333
You know, at the moment,
in terms of how viable this contact

670
00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:39.458
tracing operation is going to be,
an awful lot of that does depend

671
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:40.500
on government communication.

672
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.791
And that is one of the areas
where I think we have seen

673
00:31:44.791 --> 00:31:49.791
BorisJohnson actually, you know,
fail — and demonstrably so.

674
00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:53.208
He does not give the impression
of being on top of his brief.

675
00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:56.875
He does not inspire
public confidence.

676
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:59.041
And that is a significant feeling
at a time

677
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:01.208
and in a crisis where communication,
clarity and consistency

678
00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:03.125
of communication are,
if not half the job,

679
00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:05.291
then certainly a significant
proportion of the Prime Minister’s

680
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:09.708
job, or First Minister’sjob,
or anybody in a leadership

681
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:14.708
position at present.

682
00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:20.166
0K, Helen, do you want
to respond to that?

683
00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:25.125
Well, actually, one thing
I want to pick up is that

684
00:32:27.375 --> 00:32:29.958
the success of the next phase does
rely on people being...

685
00:32:29.958 --> 00:32:31.375
absolutely being responsible
and coming forwards

686
00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:32.708
and booking the test.

687
00:32:32.708 --> 00:32:35.083
Just in terms of what Alex
was saying, BorisJohnson

688
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.708
failing as a communicator.

689
00:32:36.708 --> 00:32:38.375
I actually think
he’s an excellent communicator

690
00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:42.000
and also very effective
at motivating the troops.

691
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.125
But I do think, I know that you can,
of course, criticise

692
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:48.208
any stage of the pandemic,
if only this or if only only that,

693
00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:50.125
but also that actually
extraordinary things have happened.

694
00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:55.166
Extraordinary things
have been achieved.

695
00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:59.708
A huge growth in the volume of
testing at incredible pace, given...

696
00:32:59.708 --> 00:33:04.041
We have got the second highest
death toll in the world

697
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.375
in absolute numbers.

698
00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:08.333
So, I think, I think we should...

699
00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:10.791
We are absolutely looking
at what other countries are doing.

700
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:14.375
I think one thing we do know is,
is that now is not the moment

701
00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:16.791
where we can actually really
compare those kind of things

702
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:17.875
between different countries.

703
00:33:17.875 --> 00:33:21.958
But the important thing
is that every life lost

704
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:26.916
is somebody who we mourn
and with sadness.

705
00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:30.750
But we also need to make sure
that we are able to move on and keep

706
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:35.791
the infection rate under control
and try and begin to get life more

707
00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:39.000
in the direction of normal now.

708
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.041
Ian.

709
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:42.708
Well, Ithink, Fiona,
one of the key features of this

710
00:33:42.708 --> 00:33:44.875
whole pandemic has been
the lack of a coordinated

711
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:45.958
international response.

712
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:49.791
And I’m tempted to say
at this point,

713
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:52.208
could viewers in Scotland
please turn over to BBC Two?

714
00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:54.708
Please don’t, if you don’t mind!

715
00:33:54.708 --> 00:33:59.083
We can’t even get the four
nations to work together.

716
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:01.500
So the explanation that Helen
gave at the very start

717
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.166
of her answer to this question
is different in Scotland.

718
00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:07.000
It’s going to be different in Wales
and different in Northern Ireland,

719
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.416
and why we don’t have coordination
across the UK is one of the big

720
00:34:10.416 --> 00:34:11.583
questions that people keep asking.

721
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:14.333
And let’s not forget,
and Layla’s absolutely right,

722
00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:17.500
the reason we are so far behind
in international terms on this track

723
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.583
and trace is because we abandoned
that as a principle back in early

724
00:34:20.583 --> 00:34:22.500
March, and have only come
round to realising

725
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.166
that’s the only way out of this.

726
00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:27.541
And the key elements of that,
if I canjust finish on this point,

727
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:29.083
you have to test, test, test.

728
00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:31.791
This goes all the way back
to what the World Health

729
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.458
Organization said in January.

730
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:34.916
England has a dreadful testing
record,

731
00:34:34.916 --> 00:34:37.541
and you’re going to have
to do at least a quarter

732
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:40.458
of a million a day to get anywhere
near this being proper.

733
00:34:40.458 --> 00:34:42.125
And that’s what
we’ve been calling for.

734
00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:45.208
And Scotland has one of the worst
testing rates in the entire world.

735
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.250
Until that’s resolved,

736
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:51.208
this system cannot operate properly
to keep people safe.

737
00:34:51.208 --> 00:34:53.875
John. John Swinney, do you want
to come back on it?

738
00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:56.500
Well, we’re now in the situation
where Scotland has the capacity

739
00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.500
to do 15,000 tests on a daily basis.

740
00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:04.541
But you’re not doing
anything like those numbers.

741
00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:07.208
Sorry to interrupt, but you’re not
doing anything like those numbers.

742
00:35:07.208 --> 00:35:08.250
15,000.

743
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.875
Well, we’ve got capacity
in place to now do that,

744
00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:14.000
when it’s at the most critical
moment when we’ve

745
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.041
suppressed the virus.

746
00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:18.166
And we have the capacity to do
the contact tracing.

747
00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:20.583
We’ve got the communications
in place to set that out.

748
00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:23.375
We’ve had that in place
at the critical moment

749
00:35:23.375 --> 00:35:26.833
where we begin to relax
some of the great restrictions

750
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:30.416
that have been in place.

751
00:35:30.416 --> 00:35:33.291
So the strategy has come together
in exactly the right timing to

752
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:36.666
make sure that we have the capacity
in place to provide the support that

753
00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:37.833
individuals in the country require.

754
00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:40.666
Just to be clear, John, what’s
stopping you reaching that capacity?

755
00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:44.000
What’s stopping you
reaching the capacity?

756
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.958
You’ve got capacity
for 15,000 tests, for example,

757
00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:49.166
and you’re doing
nothing like those numbers.

758
00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:52.541
Well, we’re constantly expanding
the range of individuals

759
00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:56.041
who are able to get tests.

760
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:59.875
So, for example, we are doing
a great deal more availability

761
00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:01.250
of testing within care homes.

762
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.208
We have mobile testing services
moving around the country.

763
00:36:04.208 --> 00:36:06.875
We have much more capacity
available for people to go to

764
00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:10.000
to get particular tests.

765
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
We’ve got availability in place
for key workers and for home care

766
00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:17.875
workers and for those
delivering services,

767
00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:20.791
so a whole range of different areas
where we’ve expanded the capacity

768
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:22.708
and the eligibility to
make sure that individuals

769
00:36:22.708 --> 00:36:25.541
can get the tests requirement.

770
00:36:25.541 --> 00:36:27.666
0K. Ian, very briefly.

771
00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:32.250
The epicentre of this pandemic
is in our care homes in Scotland.

772
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.916
Over half of all the deaths
are now in care homes,

773
00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:37.500
and 46% of all deaths
are in care homes in Scotland.

774
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.416
We are still not testing
care home patients.

775
00:36:39.416 --> 00:36:42.083
We’re still not testing
on a regular basis care home staff.

776
00:36:42.083 --> 00:36:43.500
And you can’t talk about capacity.

777
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.166
You have to talk
about test delivery.

778
00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:46.416
It’s simply not happening yet.

779
00:36:46.416 --> 00:36:48.916
Yes, we are.
We’re doing all that, Ian.

780
00:36:48.916 --> 00:36:51.791
Not with the care homes
that get in touch with me daily,

781
00:36:51.791 --> 00:36:54.458
whose patients, residents and staff
are not being tested.

782
00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:58.625
Alex, you wanted to come in.

783
00:36:58.625 --> 00:37:02.583
Sorry, there’s two Alexes.
I’m confusing things greatly.

784
00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:05.000
My question is, without
the antibody, the fact that people

785
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.166
know they’ve already been infected,
how is this trace

786
00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:08.333
and trace going to work?

787
00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:11.000
Am I going to have to self—isolate
over and over again?

788
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.958
If I come into contact
with someone once,

789
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:15.333
am I going to have
to take 1A days off?

790
00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:18.958
If I come into contact with someone
else, do I take another 1A days off?

791
00:37:18.958 --> 00:37:20.583
People who are self—employed
and other people

792
00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:23.500
are not going to be manage that,
it’s not going to be

793
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.541
possible for people.

794
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:26.708
I mean, this is the tricky
thing, isn’t it?

795
00:37:26.708 --> 00:37:28.625
Because, as Alex is saying,
you might have

796
00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:29.833
to self—isolate more than once.

797
00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:31.750
And let’s just remind
ourselves what that means.

798
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.000
That means, for example,
if you have to share

799
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.875
a bathroom with your family,
you have to use it a different

800
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:39.250
time, and then you have
to wipe it all down.

801
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.625
I think you put your rubbish
in several bags when you put it out.

802
00:37:42.625 --> 00:37:45.250
I mean, you have to keep away
from your entire family

803
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.416
and you might have to do
this several times.

804
00:37:47.416 --> 00:37:50.583
We’re not asking people to isolate
within their households.

805
00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:53.000
So you’re not worried
about if they infect their family?

806
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.916
If you’re being asked to...

807
00:37:54.916 --> 00:37:56.833
I should distinguish
between if you’re being asked

808
00:37:56.833 --> 00:38:01.791
to isolate if you’ve got symptoms.

809
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:07.375
If you’re being asked
to self—isolate at home with your...

810
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:11.166
We’re not asking anyone
in the household to isolate.

811
00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:13.791
But it’s during that period
where you are in the possible

812
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:15.500
incubation period
to see whether you might

813
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.958
contract the virus.

814
00:38:18.958 --> 00:38:22.041
And I recognise that there is a risk
that you might be asked

815
00:38:22.041 --> 00:38:23.500
to do that more than once,

816
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.958
but if people follow
social distancing...

817
00:38:24.958 --> 00:38:27.083
So if people are following social
distancing and minimising

818
00:38:27.083 --> 00:38:30.208
their contact, so if they’re having
to go to a workplace to work,

819
00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:32.125
but social distancing
in the workplace is really

820
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:34.041
important, because that’s how
you avoid becoming somebody

821
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:39.041
who’s a contact of the sort that
needs to isolate.

822
00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:45.000
In England, you can
go to barbecues now,

823
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.666
I think in Scotland,
correct me if I’m wrong, you can’t.

824
00:38:47.666 --> 00:38:48.875
You can.
Yes, you can.

825
00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:53.791
You can go to a barbecue.

826
00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:55.958
Yes, because two households,
no more than eight people.

827
00:38:55.958 --> 00:38:59.708
It’s no more than eight
people, six in England,

828
00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:01.125
two households can meet,
socially distance,

829
00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:04.916
in public or private outdoor spaces.

830
00:39:04.916 --> 00:39:06.333
So you could have a barbecue.

831
00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:08.250
This is how ridiculous
this whole situation is.

832
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:10.166
It’s eight in Scotland.
It’s six in England.

833
00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:12.083
Why can’t we just get
a UK—wide approach

834
00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.125
and everyone works together?

835
00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:15.291
And also a barbecue
all keeping two metres distance,

836
00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:16.458
that’s going to be quite...

837
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:18.375
I mean, that’s a heck of a garden

838
00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:20.583
you’re going to have to have
to accommodate that.

839
00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:22.000
For no more than 15 minutes.

840
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.208
We’re asking people to gradually...

841
00:39:23.208 --> 00:39:26.291
It’s small steps to try and
make life be a little bit better.

842
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:29.208
We’re alljust trying to make sense
of exactly how it works

843
00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:32.958
since we’re going to have
to be doing this.

844
00:39:32.958 --> 00:39:34.625
Jeanette, you just
wanted to come in.

845
00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:36.750
Let me bring you in.

846
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.750
I work from home.

847
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.416
This track and trace has
the ability to close my business

848
00:39:43.416 --> 00:39:46.625
down every single week.

849
00:39:46.625 --> 00:39:48.791
And I don’t know
what I’m going to do.

850
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:51.083
I’m already closed.
Financially, it’s been a nightmare.

851
00:39:51.083 --> 00:39:56.083
And now, if any of my staff
or any of my family,

852
00:39:57.041 --> 00:40:01.708
or they go into any of the houses
to clean or do anything,

853
00:40:01.708 --> 00:40:05.208
we’re closed.

854
00:40:05.208 --> 00:40:07.083
And I was wondering,

855
00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:10.458
who is going to pick
up the pieces for me?

856
00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:13.000
Because we know the small businesses
who work from home

857
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.333
have already been missed out
on everything.

858
00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:18.708
And now we’ve got track and trace
that could close me down again every

859
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:21.333
single week or have girls going off
sick because they’ve been

860
00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:22.541
to vulnerable houses,
vulnerable places.

861
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:27.541
And they’ve been doing theirjob
and Ijust don’t know what to do.

862
00:40:28.916 --> 00:40:31.625
Is the Government
going to sort this out?

863
00:40:31.625 --> 00:40:33.541
You run a cleaning company,
don’t you, Jeanette?

864
00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:36.833
You’ve got various people going out
to clean up people’s homes.

865
00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:38.625
50, John Swinney,
what is the compensation

866
00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:41.583
package going to be?
I mean, so if you are someone...

867
00:40:41.583 --> 00:40:46.541
Either you’re Janette,
who runs a company or you’re someone

868
00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:53.041
who works with Jeanette
and a lot of small companies

869
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:54.291
are in a similar position.

870
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:55.958
They suddenly get either
they get symptoms.

871
00:40:55.958 --> 00:40:58.083
You’ve got to self—isolate
for the next 1A days

872
00:40:58.083 --> 00:40:59.333
and let’s see what happens.

873
00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:01.000
What compensation will
there be for them?

874
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.666
I think the point thatJeanette
makes, it illustrates the fact

875
00:41:03.666 --> 00:41:06.000
that there has to be ongoing support
arrangements in place

876
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.708
for individuals and for businesses
to make sure that people can

877
00:41:08.708 --> 00:41:11.333
navigate their way through what’s
going to be a difficult period,

878
00:41:11.333 --> 00:41:13.208
if they have to participate
in contact tracing.

879
00:41:13.208 --> 00:41:15.125
So what will they be,
John, very specifically?

880
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:17.333
Because the provision
for the self—employed, for example,

881
00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:19.291
come to an end in about three days.

882
00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:21.541
People working forJeanette
are self—employed.

883
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:23.958
So what provision will be
put in place for them?

884
00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:26.625
That’s what I was coming onto.

885
00:41:26.625 --> 00:41:29.458
There has to be a need
for an ongoing scheme of support

886
00:41:29.458 --> 00:41:31.208
to assist individuals
in that respect.

887
00:41:31.208 --> 00:41:34.541
Which is why we continue
to press the UK Treasury

888
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:38.125
to recognise this is not
a short—term issue.

889
00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:42.541
This is a long—term issue
that we’ve got to see sustained.

890
00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:45.458
The indications from
the Treasury are, for example,

891
00:41:45.458 --> 00:41:46.875
on the furlough scheme,

892
00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:51.125
that’s going to be constrained
in August by the Chancellor.

893
00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.333
And that’s a very damaging
move, because we know

894
00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:55.750
that the implications of Covid
are going to be with

895
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.833
us for a long time.

896
00:41:57.833 --> 00:42:00.000
So we’re appealing to the UK
Government to recognise

897
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.625
the longevity of this problem
and put in place the support

898
00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:07.666
to enable that to be the case.

899
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:12.708
0K, well, we’ve got Helen Whately
here, John, so let’s ask her.

900
00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:16.458
So someone inJeanette’s position,
very specifically, self—employed,

901
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:19.500
that comes to an end
in the next few days,

902
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.625
what will the Government do
for people like her?

903
00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:22.666
So, I don’t...

904
00:42:22.666 --> 00:42:25.291
On this I agree withJohn,
and the importance of having

905
00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:27.708
the support for people who,
for instance, are required to

906
00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:29.125
isolate because of test and trace.

907
00:42:29.125 --> 00:42:32.291
It’s up to the UK Government.
50 what are you going to do?

908
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:34.875
And I know that that must be
something that the Chancellor

909
00:42:34.875 --> 00:42:37.166
specifically to look at is on the
self—employment question.

910
00:42:37.166 --> 00:42:42.125
We know that for those
who are employed, they will be

911
00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:45.708
eligible for statutory sick pay.

912
00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:47.625
If they are asked to isolate.

913
00:42:47.625 --> 00:42:49.916
For someone inJeannette’s
position specifically,

914
00:42:49.916 --> 00:42:51.833
she’s come on the programme
this evening saying,

915
00:42:51.833 --> 00:42:54.416
what are you going to do
for people like me?

916
00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:57.166
What is the Government doing?

917
00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:58.750
I can’t pre—empt what the...

918
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:03.125
The decision of the Chancellor
will make on that.

919
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:08.166
But it is absolutely true
that we do need to make sure

920
00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:11.000
that people are able to afford
what they need in life

921
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.416
and recognise the costs of this.

922
00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:14.333
Also that we do need
to have something

923
00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:15.416
which is economically sustainable.

924
00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:18.750
So we need to have a way to be
beginning to restart the economy

925
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.416
because of the huge amount
of economic support that has gone

926
00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:24.750
to those who are in employment,
those who own businesses

927
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:29.291
across the economy,
a huge amount of support.

928
00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:32.666
We now need to get the economy
back up and running.

929
00:43:32.666 --> 00:43:34.416
And more people going back to work.

930
00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:36.583
Well, I’m sure Janette
will wait with great interest

931
00:43:36.583 --> 00:43:39.625
to see what comes out.

932
00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:41.625
As the Prime Minister said today,

933
00:43:41.625 --> 00:43:44.250
we will look after everybody locally
who was affected by this.

934
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.583
So let’s see what happens.

935
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:50.916
Let’s hear now from
Rena Cuthbertson. Rena.

936
00:43:50.916 --> 00:43:55.500
Good evening, Fiona,
good evening, panel.

937
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.083
Was the policy indecision
regarding the emptying of hospital

938
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:04.125
beds with the patients not
being tested and the outrageous

939
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.750
consequences on elderly citizens
a planned arrangement?

940
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.875
And if so, does this not highlight
the lack of value and respect

941
00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:13.541
that we place in the elderly?

942
00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:15.750
So was it a planned arrangement

943
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.458
allowing people back into care homes
without being tested?

944
00:44:18.458 --> 00:44:22.833
And does it highlight the lack
of value and respect?

945
00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:29.041
Yes, Alex. Alex Massie.

946
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.791
The care home situation I think
is one of those areas

947
00:44:31.791 --> 00:44:34.416
where governments in all parts
of the United Kingdom faced

948
00:44:34.416 --> 00:44:38.000
a terrible set of choices.

949
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
You know, in hindsight,
as Nicola Sturgeon said this week,

950
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.791
they would probably make
some decisions differently.

951
00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:46.000
You know, at the time
when people were released

952
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.541
from hospital into care
homes, it was...

953
00:44:49.541 --> 00:44:52.416
They feared that the NHS
and the hospitals were going to be

954
00:44:52.416 --> 00:44:56.875
overwhelmed with Covid cases.

955
00:44:56.875 --> 00:45:01.083
And so, you know, what do we do
with people who are,

956
00:45:01.083 --> 00:45:05.625
you know, delayed discharge,
bed blocking, whatever?

957
00:45:05.625 --> 00:45:09.375
Well, get them out, almost
regardless of their circumstance.

958
00:45:09.375 --> 00:45:12.000
And that now, because the sort
of tsunami of Covid cases

959
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.958
didn’t quite materialize,
that now looks to be

960
00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:15.458
a terrible mistake.

961
00:45:15.458 --> 00:45:19.833
And obviously, with hindsight,
it was a mistake.

962
00:45:19.833 --> 00:45:24.041
But at the time it was made,
I think it’s reasonable

963
00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:26.458
for politicians to say,
well, but this was the choice

964
00:45:26.458 --> 00:45:30.125
that we had available to us.

965
00:45:30.125 --> 00:45:34.000
But you can only do that, I think,
you can only get the public to trust

966
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.625
you if you communicate with candor.

967
00:45:35.625 --> 00:45:38.500
If you allow that mistakes will be
made in a fiercely complicated

968
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.333
and unprecedented set of situations.

969
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:44.041
But you can’t just allow that
mistakes that will be made.

970
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.666
You have to actually sort
of admit to them and take

971
00:45:46.666 --> 00:45:47.916
ownership of them as well.

972
00:45:47.916 --> 00:45:51.250
If you treat it, if we treat people
like adults, there is a chance

973
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.416
that they will understand
the position you’re coming from.

974
00:45:53.416 --> 00:45:57.541
But you can’t just sort of deny that
any mistakes took place.

975
00:45:57.541 --> 00:46:01.000
And it seems to me to be
infantilizing the government’s,

976
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.875
of government ministers wherever
they happen to be to try and pretend

977
00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:05.291
that that could be the case.

978
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:07.708
You know, people understand
that this is a really, really

979
00:46:07.708 --> 00:46:09.708
difficult situation to manage.

980
00:46:09.708 --> 00:46:12.625
And that’s why even though patience
may be beginning to wear thin,

981
00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:15.708
I think there is still a residual
degree of goodwill of

982
00:46:15.708 --> 00:46:19.708
the government, if government can
can be shown to be responsive

983
00:46:19.708 --> 00:46:24.291
to this situation, can show
that it is accepting and taking

984
00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:26.458
ownership of mistakes and the care
home situation is

985
00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:28.583
clearly one of them.

986
00:46:28.583 --> 00:46:32.500
You can’t go around prattling
on about how, you know,

987
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.333
thrown a protective ring around care
homes at the same time, as,

988
00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:38.208
you know, thousands and thousands
of people are dying in care homes.

989
00:46:38.208 --> 00:46:41.291
And the final point
of the question there,

990
00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:44.041
you know, it is clear,
I think, that for a long,

991
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:48.333
long time, care homes have
been sort of overlooked,

992
00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:53.375
too often forgotten part
of the whole health and social care

993
00:46:53.708 --> 00:46:56.541
network, and that sometimes perhaps
seen as a convenient place to park

994
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:58.458
people whose presence elsewhere
might be deemed undesirable

995
00:46:58.458 --> 00:47:02.083
or too complicated.

996
00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:03.791
Let’s hearfrom Elaine
in the audience.

997
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:05.958
You’ve had your hand
up for a short while.

998
00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:07.000
Hi, Fiona.

999
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.666
I agree with Alex.

1000
00:47:11.666 --> 00:47:15.000
I think at the start of this
pandemic, it was a tsunami and no

1001
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.666
one really knew what they would do.

1002
00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:21.375
And I think the choice when we saw
those horrific images

1003
00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:26.333
from the Italian hospitals
of patients lying in corridors,

1004
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.125
couldn’t catch a breath,
I think the right decision was made

1005
00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:37.541
at this time to make sure
the hospitals were clear

1006
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:40.208
that we wouldn’t have those images
in front of our newspapers.

1007
00:47:40.208 --> 00:47:43.041
And I think Nicola Sturgeon has
looked back, like Alex said there,

1008
00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:45.000
and thought, you know,
in hindsight, she probably

1009
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.208
would have done things differently.

1010
00:47:46.208 --> 00:47:49.791
I think the choice at the time
of having that tsunami of patients,

1011
00:47:49.791 --> 00:47:54.125
you know, with Covid,
versus letting elderly patients go

1012
00:47:54.125 --> 00:47:57.708
into a care home where they probably
thought that was going to be a safer

1013
00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:02.708
place for them at the time
and was probably...

1014
00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:08.416
It was a lose—lose choice now that
we look back but at the time,

1015
00:48:08.416 --> 00:48:11.583
we were trying to get away
from those images of what we were

1016
00:48:11.583 --> 00:48:13.958
seeing all over the press
with people not being able

1017
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:15.125
to have a hospital bed.

1018
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:18.250
And we didn’t, it didn’t come
to that, which is a good thing.

1019
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.916
So I think it is a lose—lose,
it’s an unfortunate situation.

1020
00:48:20.916 --> 00:48:23.583
Rena, you wanted to come back in,
you asked the question?

1021
00:48:23.583 --> 00:48:24.875
Yes, thanks very much.

1022
00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:28.250
I think in terms of the planning,
you know, we have known about this

1023
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:33.250
since the end of December.

1024
00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:34.541
ﬂ

1025
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:38.291
I know it’s not a long time but what
has been clear from the start, the

1026
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:38.500
has been clear from the start, the
most

1027
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.041
has been clear from the start, the
most vulnerable in the communities

1028
00:48:41.041 --> 00:48:44.291
most vulnerable in the communities
are the elderty.

1029
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:45.833
most vulnerable in the communities
are the elderly. And we let the

1030
00:48:45.833 --> 00:48:46.125
are the elderty. And we let the
people --

1031
00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:46.833
are the elderly. And we let the
people —— people leave hospital

1032
00:48:46.833 --> 00:48:46.958
peopla -- peopla leave hospital
without

1033
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:48.125
people —— people leave hospital
without being tested and put them in

1034
00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:48.375
without being tested and put them in
rare

1035
00:48:48.375 --> 00:48:49.583
without being tested and put them in
care homes.

1036
00:48:49.583 --> 00:48:53.416
We put them back in their own homes,
to be cared for by home care workers

1037
00:48:53.416 --> 00:48:55.083
or by support agencies or by family.

1038
00:48:55.083 --> 00:48:57.541
And nobody was tested.

1039
00:48:57.541 --> 00:49:00.708
And so I knew there was tough
decisions, and I’m no’ just talking

1040
00:49:00.708 --> 00:49:02.333
about the Scottish Government,
I mean generally

1041
00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:03.541
right across the UK.

1042
00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:06.958
And I know we were flooded
with pictures, you know,

1043
00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:10.000
but maybe if the cameras
were in and out the care homes,

1044
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.583
we would be flooded wi’ as many
pictures of people dying

1045
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:14.291
in care homes horrendously.

1046
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:19.250
Ijust think, you know,
there’s no winners in this.

1047
00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:25.583
And I know it’s been difficult,
and I know that the whole thing

1048
00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:30.083
is new to us, and Ijust think
they’re the most vulnerable

1049
00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:35.041
and they are always, I feel,
the first to be forgotten.

1050
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.333
You know, we clap and we applaud
Captain Tom, and many of his

1051
00:49:40.333 --> 00:49:42.750
generation have just been left
to die in care homes,

1052
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.250
and Ijust think it’s outrageous.

1053
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.416
And I thinkjust the other thing,
Fiona, to say is every time

1054
00:49:49.416 --> 00:49:51.541
the Conservative member speaks,
all we hear is, well,

1055
00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:55.000
you know, we cannot compare
ourselves to the countries,

1056
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.333
let’s put the Dominic Raab to bed,
let’s not talk about anything that’s

1057
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:04.375
showing us up to be,
you know, the unorganised, em...

1058
00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:08.708
0K, Helen, I’ll give
you a chance to respond

1059
00:50:08.708 --> 00:50:11.333
to that in a minute,
but thank you, Rena, for that,

1060
00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:16.375
I’m not trying to cut you off there.

1061
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:19.416
In terms of what Rena is saying,
what Alex’s saying as well,

1062
00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:21.083
Nicola Sturgeon saying,
you know, with hindsight,

1063
00:50:21.083 --> 00:50:23.500
which of course is a wonderful
thing, I might have

1064
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500
done things differently.

1065
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.125
When it comes to care homes,
specifically asking you, what would

1066
00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:28.208
you have done differently?

1067
00:50:28.208 --> 00:50:33.166
I think the circumstances that have
been narrated by all three

1068
00:50:33.791 --> 00:50:36.416
of the comments that have spoken,
I can’t do it disagree

1069
00:50:36.416 --> 00:50:38.333
with their analysis.

1070
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:43.375
At the time that Covid
was coming towards us,

1071
00:50:44.125 --> 00:50:49.166
we realised and we thought the best
thing to do was to ensure that older

1072
00:50:50.625 --> 00:50:53.958
people who were being accommodated
in hospitals when there was no

1073
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:57.041
clinical need for them to be
there would be better

1074
00:50:57.041 --> 00:51:01.416
protected in care homes,
because if there was an influx

1075
00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:04.041
of Covid cases into hospitals,
where vulnerable elderly people

1076
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:07.958
were, the danger of cross—infection
was very high, so the judgment was,

1077
00:51:07.958 --> 00:51:10.541
if it was safe to do so,
if the risk assessment

1078
00:51:10.541 --> 00:51:13.208
was undertaken, those individuals
could be accommodated either at home

1079
00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:17.250
with support or in a care home.

1080
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.916
And there’s been constant political
pressure on us to reduce delayed

1081
00:51:20.916 --> 00:51:23.250
discharges in hospitals,
to get all the people out

1082
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.958
of hospitals and into
care homes situations.

1083
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:30.958
So we followed that approach.

1084
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.041
But, of course, we have discovered
just how brutal Covid is to older

1085
00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:40.083
members of our society
and our community.

1086
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:44.375
John, sorry to interrupt,
but surely we could see

1087
00:51:44.375 --> 00:51:46.791
from the other countries quite how
brutal coronavirus was to

1088
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:49.916
the older generation —
that evidence was already there.

1089
00:51:49.916 --> 00:51:53.208
Yes, but my point is that we judged
that the best and safest way

1090
00:51:53.208 --> 00:51:56.083
to support those individuals
was in a care home setting

1091
00:51:56.083 --> 00:52:00.625
or at home with support,
rather than the hospital setting,

1092
00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:03.708
which would be the epicentre
of handling coronavirus cases.

1093
00:52:03.708 --> 00:52:08.666
0K, well, let mejust turn
to Layla for a moment,

1094
00:52:10.833 --> 00:52:13.500
because hearing what Alex Massie’s
saying, whatJohn’s saying, I mean,

1095
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.833
there were other countries before us
grappling with this,

1096
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:19.750
and they admitted people from
hospitals back into their homes,

1097
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.625
but in some cases in some country,
they put them into quarantine,

1098
00:52:22.625 --> 00:52:27.625
special places or quarantine
within care homes.

1099
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.708
Is there anything we could have
learned from that, reasonably,

1100
00:52:30.708 --> 00:52:34.083
or is Alex right, that actually,
you know, this is the best we could

1101
00:52:34.083 --> 00:52:35.291
have done in the circumstances?

1102
00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:36.458
It’s incredibly hard to say.

1103
00:52:36.458 --> 00:52:39.666
I look at all what other countries
have done, and as you say,

1104
00:52:39.666 --> 00:52:42.458
there’s been some sort of quarantine
centres or interim places to go.

1105
00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:43.791
It’s not exactly clear.

1106
00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:46.958
I mean, obviously, what has happened
with Covid—19 in care homes has been

1107
00:52:46.958 --> 00:52:50.208
an absolute tragedy.

1108
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:53.333
But the reasons for that are not
quite as clear cut as sometimes

1109
00:52:53.333 --> 00:52:54.375
people are assuming.

1110
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:56.541
So we hear people say, oh,
it’s because everyone

1111
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:59.291
was sent out of hospital.

1112
00:52:59.291 --> 00:53:03.708
But actually, when you look
at the data, it’s not totally clear

1113
00:53:03.708 --> 00:53:07.750
that that was something that has
created this challenge.

1114
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.166
You think it might have spread
in care homes anyway?

1115
00:53:10.166 --> 00:53:14.416
Well, that’s the thing.

1116
00:53:14.416 --> 00:53:17.541
I mean, at the end of the day,
we don’t know when this

1117
00:53:17.541 --> 00:53:20.958
first started circulating.

1118
00:53:20.958 --> 00:53:25.458
It looks as though when you started
testing has a real impact on this.

1119
00:53:25.458 --> 00:53:28.958
Looking at other countries and care
homes, it looks like people

1120
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:32.000
going in and out of care homes,
potentially, of course, playing

1121
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.916
its role, and while we really,
really want an answer to that,

1122
00:53:34.916 --> 00:53:39.000
it’s too early to figure
out what’s going on.

1123
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000
But we can see that we’d need
an answer, and we need to learn,

1124
00:53:45.208 --> 00:53:48.083
and I guess that what I’d say
is that this, it really

1125
00:53:48.083 --> 00:53:50.250
exposes the underinvestment
and the undervaluing of social care

1126
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:53.625
for successive governments.

1127
00:53:53.625 --> 00:53:58.625
And what we really need
here is a bit of a long—term plan.

1128
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.375
We’ve seen what’s going on in social
care, and it’s really great

1129
00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:04.750
that the Government is now,
you know, giving some money

1130
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:07.166
towards social care to say,
goodness, we need to bolster,

1131
00:54:07.166 --> 00:54:12.166
for example, your infection
control mechanisms.

1132
00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:16.375
Our members have been telling us
for ages that while hospitals

1133
00:54:16.375 --> 00:54:21.416
are starting to get PPE in,
care homes have been in a much worse

1134
00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:26.833
position, there’s a lot
of disparity here.

1135
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:29.958
So there’s new funding so that care
homes are able to get better

1136
00:54:29.958 --> 00:54:32.083
infection control processes in place
and things like that.

1137
00:54:32.083 --> 00:54:37.000
But that’s a short—term fix,
and when we look at this,

1138
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.625
we think, goodness, the moment
is here for social care reform.

1139
00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:41.791
And what are we going
to do about it?

1140
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:43.708
What’s the Government
going to do about it?

1141
00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:44.750
Ian.

1142
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.916
Well, I think the chronic
underfunding of social care

1143
00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:49.041
across the United Kingdom
and in Scotland, the chickens

1144
00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:50.500
are now coming home to roost.

1145
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.916
And this was a problem under Labour
governments as well.

1146
00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:54.833
It’s been a problem for a long time.

1147
00:54:54.833 --> 00:54:57.708
But we need some kind of political
consensus to fund social care.

1148
00:54:57.708 --> 00:54:59.916
We’ve been talking about
this now for too long.

1149
00:54:59.916 --> 00:55:01.833
But let’s go through
what we already knew.

1150
00:55:01.833 --> 00:55:04.666
We knew that the prevalence of this
disease was in older people,

1151
00:55:04.666 --> 00:55:07.291
it was much more severe
in older people.

1152
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:10.208
We knew from the 2014 report
and task force for social care

1153
00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:12.583
that there was 3A recommendations,
very few of them were

1154
00:55:12.583 --> 00:55:14.333
implemented in Scotland.

1155
00:55:14.333 --> 00:55:17.416
We knew in 2015 that the Government
and the Scottish Government had said

1156
00:55:17.416 --> 00:55:19.583
they would eradicate bed blocking —
it wasn’t done.

1157
00:55:19.583 --> 00:55:22.708
We knew from the Silver Swan report
there was a problem with PPE

1158
00:55:22.708 --> 00:55:25.333
and a problem with testing if we had
a global pandemic.

1159
00:55:25.333 --> 00:55:29.333
All of that has since happened,
and the decision was made

1160
00:55:29.333 --> 00:55:31.750
by the Scottish Government to move
912 elderly people from

1161
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:33.500
hospital to care homes.

1162
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.500
Now, that in itself is a big
decision, and it’s a decision

1163
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:41.541
I completely agree withJohn,
these big decisions have to be made.

1164
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.875
But the key thing here was that
we’re taking from hospital to care

1165
00:55:44.875 --> 00:55:46.833
homes without testing.

1166
00:55:46.833 --> 00:55:49.500
So we’re essentially exporting
the disease on the people that it

1167
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.666
affects the most into care.

1168
00:55:50.666 --> 00:55:53.583
We have just heard Layla say
that we can’t be sure that

1169
00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.750
that was the critical deciding
factor in terms of

1170
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:58.583
exponential growth.

1171
00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:00.750
Well, 46% of all coronavirus
deaths in Scotland have

1172
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:01.958
been in our care homes.

1173
00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:07.000
This is the epicentre
of coronavirus.

1174
00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:09.791
And that’s why, because we sent
people there without testing,

1175
00:56:09.791 --> 00:56:11.958
we sent people there
without the lack of PPE.

1176
00:56:11.958 --> 00:56:13.875
And the figures, you
looked at them earlier.

1177
00:56:13.875 --> 00:56:16.791
Scotland does have one of the worst
testing rates in the world,

1178
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:19.375
And the biggest problem
with that is trying to get testing

1179
00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.625
into the social care sector.

1180
00:56:20.625 --> 00:56:23.541
We’re only doing between 4—6,000
a day, so how can we possibly

1181
00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:26.125
protect the residents and the staff
in care homes without fundamentally

1182
00:56:26.125 --> 00:56:28.791
testing them regularly and making
sure that they are safe?

1183
00:56:28.791 --> 00:56:33.125
Helen, let mejust bring you back
to Rena’s original question,

1184
00:56:33.125 --> 00:56:35.750
which is, was the policy a planned
arrangement, putting patients

1185
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:37.916
in care homes from hospitals
who hadn’t been tested?

1186
00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:40.833
And does it highlight the lack
of value and respect we place

1187
00:56:40.833 --> 00:56:43.000
on elderly citizens?

1188
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.375
So every step of the way,
the Government followed scientific

1189
00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:51.416
guidance on what to do,
and clinical guidance and...

1190
00:56:51.458 --> 00:56:55.583
Hang on, there was also government
guidance, so April the 2nd,

1191
00:56:55.583 --> 00:57:00.000
the UK Government guidance
was negative tests are not required

1192
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.625
for asymptomatic elderly patients
prior to transfers into care home.

1193
00:57:02.625 --> 00:57:05.166
That was government advice.

1194
00:57:05.166 --> 00:57:07.833
Government guidance was informed
by the science and by the scientific

1195
00:57:07.833 --> 00:57:10.250
guidance, but what has happened over
time is, of course,

1196
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:14.916
that we have learned.

1197
00:57:14.916 --> 00:57:17.333
So, for instance, we’ve learned,
and the world has learned,

1198
00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:20.166
that actually we have a situation
with people who may be asymptomatic

1199
00:57:20.166 --> 00:57:23.916
carriers of the virus.

1200
00:57:23.916 --> 00:57:26.291
And it’s particularly hard,
we now know, with older people

1201
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:28.458
who don’t display the most common
set of symptoms.

1202
00:57:28.458 --> 00:57:31.291
So there’s a particular reason,
which is why we’re now doing testing

1203
00:57:31.291 --> 00:57:35.291
of all staff and residents in care
homes for older people,

1204
00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:38.250
those with dementia,
exactly to do that, to pick up those

1205
00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:40.833
who may be asymptomatic,
as well as those who have symptoms,

1206
00:57:40.833 --> 00:57:43.125
because we’re learning.

1207
00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:46.250
Butjust to go back and pick up
on some of the comments

1208
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.166
from the audience, I mean,
some really, really

1209
00:57:48.166 --> 00:57:50.083
thoughtful comments.

1210
00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:53.250
But one thing I will say is that
when I became the care

1211
00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:58.250
minister on February Mth,
and since then, I mean,

1212
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.666
so much of my time and so many
people in government

1213
00:58:01.666 --> 00:58:03.791
has been on how we can
support social care,

1214
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:05.958
both care homes and home care
through the pandemic.

1215
00:58:05.958 --> 00:58:09.416
And we know it’s really hard.

1216
00:58:09.416 --> 00:58:12.500
One of the things that we saw early
on was looking at Spain,

1217
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.916
and the situation where the army
went into care homes

1218
00:58:14.916 --> 00:58:17.625
where they’d been abandoned
and people had just been left,

1219
00:58:17.625 --> 00:58:22.250
and left to die, even from neglect.

1220
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:25.166
And we’ve put in place
a new reporting system, so we know

1221
00:58:25.166 --> 00:58:26.625
what’s going on in care homes.

1222
00:58:26.625 --> 00:58:29.750
So we get a picture of where there
might be risks of that.

1223
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:34.750
I should also say, and I talk
so much to care homes,

1224
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.833
that we should recognise that
in England, over 60% of care homes

1225
00:58:37.833 --> 00:58:39.291
have not had a Covid outbreak.

1226
00:58:39.291 --> 00:58:42.416
So actually, lots of care homes have
managed to do an amazing job

1227
00:58:42.416 --> 00:58:45.500
in keeping Covid out
of their care homes.

1228
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.375
And many of those have had it now
recovered from that outbreak

1229
00:58:48.375 --> 00:58:50.791
and things are getting better.

1230
00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:53.958
John Swinney, you wanted to come in,
we’re almost out of time,

1231
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:57.666
so briefly, Ijust want to let
you have another word.

1232
00:58:57.666 --> 00:59:02.625
I think the point I wanted to make
was that in Ian’s last answer,

1233
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:07.500
he talked about the need
for there to be measures

1234
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.916
to tackle delayed discharges,
and then when the Government tackles

1235
00:59:09.916 --> 00:59:11.833
the issue of delayed
discharge, we get criticised

1236
00:59:11.833 --> 00:59:13.083
for it by Ian Murray.

1237
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:15.708
There are really difficult decisions
that have to be taken here,

1238
00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:17.916
with the best interests
of the population at heart.

1239
00:59:17.916 --> 00:59:22.416
Tough decisions in
tough circumstances.

1240
00:59:22.416 --> 00:59:25.541
And many of the measures we’ve taken
have supported care homes to make

1241
00:59:25.541 --> 00:59:30.541
sure that individuals have had
the resources and the equipment

1242
00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:33.166
and assistance in place to make
sure they were kept safe

1243
00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:34.541
in very difficult circumstance.

1244
00:59:34.541 --> 00:59:37.208
OK, I’m afraid, I know
you want to come back in,

1245
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:38.375
but our hour is up.

1246
00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:40.833
Eleanor, I can see you’ve
got your hand up there

1247
00:59:40.833 --> 00:59:44.166
and we’ve run out of time,
so forgive me for not coming to you.

1248
00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:46.083
Tonight our questions came
from Glasgow, and thank

1249
00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:47.875
you so much to all of you.

1250
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:50.750
Next week, we will have an audience,
a virtual audience from Southampton,

1251
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:55.750
and after that from Cardiff.

1252
00:59:55.958 --> 00:59:59.291
So from now on, we’ll be looking
for 12 people to join our discussion

1253
00:59:59.291 --> 01:00:00.500
in the way that we have tonight
via video link.

1254
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.708
in the way that we have tonight
via video link.

1255
01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:06.750
So if you’d like to be part of that,
and I really hope that you will,

1256
01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:10.750
and you come from either of those
areas, do get in touch via the usual

1257
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.375
way and then we will get
back in touch with you.

1258
01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:15.791
And of course, if you want
to continue the discussion,

1259
01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:19.958
you can join Adrian Chiles
and guests on Question Time

1260
01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:22.333
Extra Time, and that is
on 5 Live right now.

1261
01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:25.458
But I just want to say thank
you very much to the panel

1262
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:27.875
for coming into the studio tonight,
and of course thank

1263
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.250
you, John and Alex,
forjoining us down the line.

1264
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.958
And thank you very much
to our guinea pigs this evening,

1265
01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:35.041
first time we’ve done this,
joining us from Glasgow,

1266
01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:36.708
I’m very grateful to all of you.

1267
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.625
And of course, you at
home for watching.

1268
01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:41.375
From Question Time, bye—bye.

1269
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:07.583
We’ve got to be able to be more open
and more able to talk about stuff.

1270
01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:10.125
Let it out. There’s people out there
that can help you.

1271
01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.000
It feels really overwhelming.

1272
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.375
Theyjust can’t cope.

1273
01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:15.166
It felt like I couldn’t
talk to anyone,

1274
01:01:15.166 --> 01:01:17.375
and part of that was because
I was ashamed of being gay.

1275
01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:19.708
I remember thinking,
"I’m just going to end this."

1276
01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.000
This is such a hard thing

1277
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.375
to define or even admit.

1278
01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:25.125
Mental health issues
can affect any one of us.

1279
01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:28.000
Talk. That’s half the healing.
We need to talk.

1280
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.625
For a range of programmes

1281
01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:32.666
to help start your conversation,
go to BBC iPlayer.

1282
01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:36.458
If you’re stuck in a style rut...

1283
01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:38.083
I’m just not brave enough.

1284
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.916
..you have come to the right place,

1285
01:01:39.916 --> 01:01:42.625
because I’ve got the perfect people
for the job.

1286
01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:44.458
How does it feel? Feels good.

1287
01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:47.916
That is such a wicked outfit.

1288
01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:49.625
I love it.

1289
01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:51.750
Confidence is through the roof now.

1290
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:55.708
This is clothes shopping like
you’ve never experienced before.

1291
01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:57.750
Look good, feel great.

1292
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.208
Brand—new You Are What You Wear.

1293
01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:09.000
You never get bored in Monaco.

1294
01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:11.583
There’s always this
picture

1295
01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:14.625
that we all swim in the caviar
all day long.

1296
01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:17.625
In Monaco, the helicopter’s
considered like a car.

1297
01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:20.208
Every morning, I’m like, "Oh,
my God, I’m living in a dream".

1298
01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:23.166
Step into a world
where too much is never enough.

1299
01:02:23.166 --> 01:02:25.625
28,000 euros. Would you like
another drink, sir?

1300
01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:55.000
There have been so many words
this week to describe

1301
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.750
the Dominic Cummings situation —

1302
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:59.875
what was it the Government used
officially to describe it?

1303
01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:01.250
'Entirely reasonabla.‘
Yeah.

1304
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.666
"Entirely legal."
Yeah.

1305
01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:06.250
Then it moved on to it
being about "Following instincts."

1306
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.458
Hmm.

1307
01:03:08.458 --> 01:03:11.291
And then it moved on a bit to...
"Move on!‘

1308
01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:15.708
Yes, more sort of end of story.
"Move on!‘

1309
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.833
And then Durham Police said "might",
and that was briefly the most used

1310
01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:21.708
word on Twitter in Britain
at one point today.

1311
01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:25.166
And then there’s the words
the public have been using,

1312
01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:28.541
here is Emma Barnett from 5 live
with some of the words that have

1313
01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:29.958
been on her daily phone in.

1314
01:03:29.958 --> 01:03:33.958
Foolish, furious and bored.

1315
01:03:33.958 --> 01:03:35.916
More from Emma later in the podcast,

1316
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:38.958
and plenty more words
on plenty more subjects.

1317
01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:41.125
But mostly about coronavirus.

1318
01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:43.291
Welcome to the Coronavirus Newscast.

1319
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:45.625
The Coronavirus Newscast
from the BBC.

1320
01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:53.583
Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

1321
01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:56.750
And Laura in the same studio
for once, but two metres apart.

1322
01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:00.125
And Fergus in New Broadcasting
House, in a studio all to myself.

1323
01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:01.541
Aw!

1324
01:04:01.541 --> 01:04:04.625
Several miles away,
but still with us in spirit.

1325
01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:08.000
Now, it’s another one
of those milestones,

1326
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.958
because the restrictions
on our movements in England,

1327
01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:12.250
certainly, get reviewed
every three weeks.

1328
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.666
Today was one of the review days,
Boris johnson

1329
01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:18.208
was at the Downing Street podium
describing it all.

1330
01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:22.125
Some stuff we knew already,
so some primary school classes

1331
01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.083
going back in England from Monday.
Yep.

1332
01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:28.458
Some shops reopen in England
from the 15th ofJune. Yep.

1333
01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:32.916
Dentists, if they can...

1334
01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:35.500
Yes, Coronacasters who’ve been
taking a close interest in this,

1335
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.416
dentistry is on the way back
in England at least.

1336
01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:43.000
On the 8th ofJune, if they’ve got
enough PPE and can operate safely.

1337
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.875
And BorisJohnson officially
launched the start

1338
01:04:44.875 --> 01:04:49.166
of barbecue season with your mates.
Here’s how he did it.

1339
01:04:49.166 --> 01:04:51.583
We will allow up to six
people to meet outside,

1340
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.625
provided those from different
households continue strictly

1341
01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:58.583
to observe social distancing rules

1342
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:06.291
by staying two metres
apart at the moment.

1343
01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:11.000
As you know, people can meet in
parks, but not in private gardens.
