disruptive whether our way. Before
we get there, overnight tonight, the

9
00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.077
we get there, overnight tonight, the
breeze is picking up across western

10
00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:17.702
breeze is picking up across western
areas. That will tend to lift the

11
00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:20.286
areas. That will tend to lift the
frost by the end of the night in the

12
00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.494
frost by the end of the night in the
West. Further east, still cold with

patches of frost to start the day on

14
00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:26.411
patches of frost to start the day on
Friday so it will be a chilly start

Northern Ireland, a few patches of

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.661
although it’s a dry start to the day
we’ll see the rain get into the

imagine how hard it is for the kids.

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:15.452

Welcome to the panel,

of course, to you at home.

80
00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:48.577
Do join in the conversation
on social media.

81
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:52.786
We would love to hear
what you’ve got to say.

82
00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:55.494
Let’s kick off with our first
question, from Georgina Jones.

83
00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:59.286
Good evening.

84
00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:02.202
Is stopping the automatic release
of terrorists enough, or is itjust

85
00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:03.244
postponing the problem 7

86
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:05.411
We have been talking
about this all this week,

87
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.827
since the attack in south London.

88
00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:07.869
Stella Creasy?

89
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:12.202
Ifear you have a point,
Georgina, actually.

90
00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:14.827
I think one of the things
all of us are worried

91
00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:17.286
about is there is a ticking
time bomb here.

92
00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:20.411
It’s not a lot of people,
we need to keep that in proportion.

93
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:23.286
And one of the things I find very
frustrating about this situation

94
00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:26.827
we are in right now is that we have
known about this for some time.

95
00:04:26.827 --> 00:04:29.286
In 2016, an independent review
showed there was a problem

96
00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:32.161
in our prisons with people who had
been radicalised, and we need

97
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:34.077
to be clear it’s notjust
Islamic radicalisation,

98
00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:36.494
there is far right radicalisation
as well, expressed very real

99
00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:38.661
concerns that our prison service
wasn’t able to cope,

100
00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:41.786
and it is now 2020 and we are
suddenly faced with the idea

101
00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:46.786
of emergency legislation.

102
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.411
We need to disrupt the behaviours
and tactics that mean that

103
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.286
people become radicalised.

104
00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:55.161
That’s the thing that’s going
to keep us safe on our streets,

105
00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.577
as well as deal with those peopla
in our prisons.

106
00:04:57.577 --> 00:04:59.952
It’s very important we talk
about the sentences as well.

107
00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:04.411
There are people that have been
convicted of terrorism offences,

108
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.494
and some of those are what you might
call low level terrorism offences.

109
00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:09.202
50 actually their sentences
aren’t very long.

110
00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:11.827
There are also people who go
into prison for other offences,

111
00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:14.494
who then become radicalised
in prison as well.

112
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:17.577
And we need to be able to deal
with all of these issues.

113
00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:19.494
Ijust worry, Robert,
it’s really frightening

114
00:05:19.494 --> 00:05:23.077
for all of us to be in a position
where we are trying to make

115
00:05:23.077 --> 00:05:25.494
legislation on the hoof to deal
with such serious issues,

116
00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:29.119
when we’ve had the evidence
about what needs to be done,

117
00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.202
when we have had 40% cuts
in the Ministry ofJustice,

118
00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:35.577
on the people who are trying to deal
with these problems,

119
00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:38.744
and actually, the work that needs
to go on within communities to stop

120
00:05:38.744 --> 00:05:42.619
these problems in the first place
has been cut as well.

121
00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:44.786
So, there will be this legislation
about automatic release.

122
00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:47.661
And I think, you know, frankly,
the idea that it’s about having

123
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:50.536
a fight with the judges is a bit
of a red herring.

124
00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:53.661
You need to have a fight
with the Treasury, if we are really

125
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:54.661
going to crack this.

126
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.869
Because you can’t do public
safety on the cheap.

127
00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:58.286
Actually, Robert Buckland,
why has this...

128
00:05:58.286 --> 00:06:00.869
Why are you in a position of having
emergency legislation?

129
00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.161
You have been in
power for ten years.

130
00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:04.994
You, yourself, have been
Solicitor General, you have

131
00:06:04.994 --> 00:06:05.161
been Prisons Minister,
now you are just a secretary.

132
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.119
been Prisons Minister,
now you are justice secretary.

133
00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.036
Since 2014, you have been
holding those positions.

134
00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:15.661
I mean, the reason you have got
people like Sudesh Amman

135
00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:17.869
coming out on the streets
is because you haven’t

136
00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:19.286
changed the law to stop it.

137
00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:20.327
In all that time.

138
00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:22.452
That’s not quite right,
because the law has evolved

139
00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:23.661
over the last few years.

140
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.577
There are sentences out there,
extended, determinate sentences,

141
00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:28.452
where if a judge says an offender
is dangerous, then the parole

142
00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:29.494
board is involved.

143
00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:31.827
What has happened here
is that there is a group

144
00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:36.577
of offenders who are subject
to automatic early release.

145
00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:39.161
That was a provision
that was put in back in ‘05,

146
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:42.411
and it therefore applies to a large
number of offences.

147
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.077
Now, as Stella says,
it is a small group of people.

148
00:06:45.077 --> 00:06:50.119
But I can’t take any
risks with public safety.

149
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.161
But you known about the risk they
posed to public safety for years.

150
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:56.327
Why haven’t you done
anything about it until now?

151
00:06:56.327 --> 00:06:58.494
But we have.

152
00:06:58.494 --> 00:07:00.869
Because while Stella is right
to talk about the review

153
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.577
that was done in 2016,
there has been an immense amount

154
00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:07.244
of work that has been
done in our prisons,

155
00:07:07.244 --> 00:07:09.661
with notjust my department,
not as the Home Office,

156
00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:11.786
but the security services,
the police, all working together,

157
00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:15.202
embedded in our prisons.

158
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:19.952
It hasn’t stopped it though, has it?

159
00:07:19.952 --> 00:07:22.369
Well, I’ll say this,
this is a very complex cohort.

160
00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:24.952
We are dealing with people who have
resorted to this behaviour

161
00:07:24.952 --> 00:07:29.994
for a myriad of reasons.

162
00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.244
There are some who are
genuinely ideological,

163
00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:34.369
and harbour deep—seated hatred.

164
00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:36.952
Who can be superficially compliant,
but who then turn on those

165
00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:41.994
who try to help them.

166
00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:47.077
There are others, I think,
that are capable of rehabilitation,

167
00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:50.786
just as other types of criminals
in the criminaljustice process

168
00:07:50.786 --> 00:07:51.869
can be rehabilitated.

169
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:53.786
But make no mistake,
this isn’t easy work.

170
00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:58.786
Night and day, there is concentrated
and coordinated activity

171
00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:04.036
by all the agencies to deal
with the problem.

172
00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:11.077
And other countries come to us
to learn from the experience we have

173
00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:13.244
had and to apply those rules
and practices in

174
00:08:13.244 --> 00:08:16.952
their own countries.

175
00:08:16.952 --> 00:08:19.411
So, it’s not a case of us
having done nothing.

176
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:22.494
We are working as hard as we can
to deal with this problem.

177
00:08:22.494 --> 00:08:26.119
But, as I said, I cannot risk any
chance here that this sort

178
00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:28.911
of atrocity can be repeated.

179
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:31.036
Hence the need for this emergency
legislation next week.

180
00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:36.036
Ed?

181
00:08:42.036 --> 00:08:44.244
I agree with Georgina
and I agree with Stella.

182
00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:46.411
This is just kicking
the can down the road.

183
00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:49.744
It may well be that we need to get
rid of early automatic release,

184
00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.202
I think I agree with that.

185
00:08:51.202 --> 00:08:53.119
But what happens when they are
eventually released?

186
00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:56.702
And we got to use the time they are
in custody to have really effective

187
00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.786
de—radicalisation programmes.

188
00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:58.952
A really effective
rehabilitation programmes.

189
00:08:58.952 --> 00:09:02.202
The Government says it’s
doing that, but it’s not.

190
00:09:02.202 --> 00:09:04.619
There are terrorist prisoners
on a waiting list to get

191
00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:06.786
on these programmes,
they are actually let out before

192
00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:10.202
they have got to the programmes.

193
00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:12.119
Because the Government have cut
the resources appallingly.

194
00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.786
And Stella’s right, there are some
people who go into prison

195
00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:17.702
and they are radicalised even more
because of the way the prison

196
00:09:17.702 --> 00:09:18.702
systems are being run.

197
00:09:18.702 --> 00:09:20.952
Our prison systems
are really overcrowded.

198
00:09:20.952 --> 00:09:23.286
People are locked up for 22
hours, in some cases.

199
00:09:23.286 --> 00:09:24.577
There are huge staff shortages.

200
00:09:24.577 --> 00:09:26.911
The management of the prisons,
Robert, is in a shocking

201
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:31.911
state, and you know that.

202
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:34.577
Independent report after
independent report shows that.

203
00:09:34.577 --> 00:09:37.702
And you are not going to deal
with this problem unless you sort

204
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:42.702
out the way that prisons are managed
and you get in early.

205
00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:43.869
APPLAUSE.

206
00:09:43.869 --> 00:09:48.327
The man there, in the blue shirt?

207
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:53.202
Isn’t this just an example of how
politicians have been distracted

208
00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:55.869
by Brexit over the past three
to four years and haven’t

209
00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:57.744
concentrated on what has
happened domestically?

210
00:09:57.744 --> 00:10:02.744
The man in the front?

211
00:10:06.036 --> 00:10:08.744
Surely those convicted of terrorism
in prison should be kept separate

212
00:10:08.744 --> 00:10:10.661
from other prisoners to avoid
them being radicalised?

213
00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:11.786
The woman at the back?

214
00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:15.202
If we get rid of early release,
shouldn’t we do it for other violent

215
00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:17.369
criminals and notjust people
accused of terrorism offences?

216
00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:18.786
Extend to other people as well?

217
00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:19.952
Yes, the woman in front?

218
00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.161
To Stella’s point about arguing
with the treasurer, aren’t

219
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:25.036
we throwing an awful lot of money
after a lot of bad...

220
00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:30.036
I suppose initiatives?

221
00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:34.119
And why aren’t we looking to see how
the initiatives that have tried,

222
00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:36.536
and tested, and failed,
why aren’t we looking to see

223
00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:39.327
what’s working and not?

224
00:10:39.327 --> 00:10:41.119
That a really good point.

225
00:10:41.119 --> 00:10:43.536
Because one of the other failings
ofJustice Department —

226
00:10:43.536 --> 00:10:46.661
sorry, Robert, you’re on the oche
here — one of the real big

227
00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:48.952
failures is they haven’t
done those evaluations.

228
00:10:48.952 --> 00:10:51.786
So there’s a whole set of different
approaches to radicalisation.

229
00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:56.786
We need to know what best practice
is to keep the public safe.

230
00:10:57.494 --> 00:11:01.869
And you are not putting enough
resources into that.

231
00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:03.327
I’m sorry, that is not right.

232
00:11:03.327 --> 00:11:05.244
We are constantly evaluating
the programmes we use,

233
00:11:05.244 --> 00:11:08.202
because the threat shifts.

234
00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:09.869
As Stella has mentioned,
far right extremism,

235
00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:10.911
absolutely correct.

236
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:14.744
But it evolves.

237
00:11:14.744 --> 00:11:18.327
And therefore, we are trying to be
as fleet of foot as possible to deal

238
00:11:18.327 --> 00:11:23.327
with that evolving threat.

239
00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:25.952
What is happening to the review
of Prevent, for example?

240
00:11:25.952 --> 00:11:29.369
Which is the policy put in place
to try to deter people from doing

241
00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:30.577
this in the first place.

242
00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:32.494
When are we going
to see that review?

243
00:11:32.494 --> 00:11:35.119
We are working on a number
of reviews at the moment.

244
00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:36.286
But that one in particular?

245
00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:37.369
Including Prevent.

246
00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:39.786
Which, frankly, if we are not
constantly reviewing the programme,

247
00:11:39.786 --> 00:11:41.702
I think we are failing in our duty.

248
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:44.036
And notjust Prevent,
it is also the protection agencies,

249
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.202
the multi—agency reviews.

250
00:11:45.202 --> 00:11:46.661
We’ve got to get those right.

251
00:11:46.661 --> 00:11:48.119
I’ve ordered a review into that.

252
00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:50.244
But, of course, I can
order myriads of reviews.

253
00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:52.702
The reality is that we are dealing
with a particularly

254
00:11:52.702 --> 00:11:53.744
complex group of people.

255
00:11:53.744 --> 00:11:56.119
The issue of separation was raised,
a very important point.

256
00:11:56.119 --> 00:11:58.286
Now, in some cases,
that can work very well.

257
00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:01.869
But there is a danger that if we put
all of the extremists in one

258
00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:06.911
unit, we are creating
a college of extremism.

259
00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:09.786
I’m sorry, Robert...

260
00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:11.702
We have to take a very
modulated approach.

261
00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:12.911
Robert, you have specialist units.

262
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.161
A special case.

263
00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:15.202
Yes, we do.

264
00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:17.827
You have specialist units for these
people and they are empty.

265
00:12:17.827 --> 00:12:19.286
No, no, they are not empty.

266
00:12:19.286 --> 00:12:21.619
Yes, they are.

267
00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:22.911
You haven’t put the resources.

268
00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:23.952
That is not true.

269
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:28.286
This point about resources...

270
00:12:28.286 --> 00:12:30.202
Hang on, are they empty
or aren’t they?

271
00:12:30.202 --> 00:12:31.244
No, they are not.

272
00:12:31.244 --> 00:12:33.661
There are a number of individuals
in the separation units.

273
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:34.702
We have spare capacity.

274
00:12:34.702 --> 00:12:37.077
But we don’t just shove people
in there for convenience.

275
00:12:37.077 --> 00:12:42.077
We have to look at each case to make
sure it is right thing to do.

276
00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:47.577
But, Robert, I know this government
doesn’t like experts very much.

277
00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:49.911
But the fact is that
you haven’t listened to any

278
00:12:49.911 --> 00:12:51.036
experts across the field.

279
00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.911
Whether it is in the criminal
justice system or whether it is

280
00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:56.077
people with expertise in counter
extremism or counter radicalisation.

281
00:12:56.077 --> 00:12:58.994
And chief among them,
I have to say, you talk about not

282
00:12:58.994 --> 00:12:59.994
wanting to take risks.

283
00:12:59.994 --> 00:13:01.036
You are the risk.

284
00:13:01.036 --> 00:13:02.994
This government is the risk.

285
00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:04.244
APPLAUSE

286
00:13:04.244 --> 00:13:08.452
Really?

287
00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:13.452
We have seen 40% cuts to the prison
and criminaljustice system.

288
00:13:13.744 --> 00:13:16.036
Cuts to prison services,
cuts to prison officers,

289
00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:18.702
cuts to policeman, cuts to legal
aid, cuts to the Crown

290
00:13:18.702 --> 00:13:23.702
Prosecution Service.

291
00:13:23.786 --> 00:13:25.911
What did you think would
happen when you savaged

292
00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:28.744
the system to that extent?

293
00:13:28.744 --> 00:13:30.827
So, of course, this
is a problem of funding.

294
00:13:30.827 --> 00:13:34.452
And it is expensive.

295
00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:36.077
Law and order, public
safety, costs money.

296
00:13:36.077 --> 00:13:38.202
You have to be willing
to invest in it.

297
00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:41.327
And clearly this government is not.

298
00:13:41.327 --> 00:13:44.077
APPLAUSE

299
00:13:44.077 --> 00:13:47.244
I agree with everything
that has been said.

300
00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:49.827
I think it leads into
the gentleman’s point that we have

301
00:13:49.827 --> 00:13:52.494
all been distracted for the past
three and a half years,

302
00:13:52.494 --> 00:13:55.619
and everything else appearsjust
completely flown off the radar.

303
00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:57.786
And I’m afraid now it’s
coming back to bite,

304
00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:02.786
and it’s biting incredibly hard.

305
00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:06.077
And when it comes to the idea
of countering extremism,

306
00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:08.744
I think if you are doing it
in prison, the horse

307
00:14:08.744 --> 00:14:11.536
has already bolted.

308
00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:15.202
And we need to deal with it
at a really early, embryonic stage,

309
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:17.827
and find out how they have been
radicalised on the outside,

310
00:14:17.827 --> 00:14:18.869
to deal with that.

311
00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:21.077
What is causing it,
what are the social factors?

312
00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:22.536
And speak to those as well.

313
00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:24.452
Because people just get more
radicalised in prisons.

314
00:14:24.452 --> 00:14:28.161
They don’t help, it makes it worse.

315
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:30.369
And if you leave them
in prison is longer,

316
00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:34.494
they are just going to have more
time to be radicalised.

317
00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:39.536
And I think we have got
the horse and the cart

318
00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:42.911
the complete wrong way
round with prison rehabilitation.

319
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:43.994
Yes, the woman there?

320
00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:45.036
APPLAUSE.

321
00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:45.619
Yes, sorry...

322
00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:49.202
A lot of these children
grow up with a diet

323
00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:52.494
in their childhood of hatred.

324
00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:54.411
So, I’m just thinking,
what are our values?

325
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:56.077
What are you trying to teach them?

326
00:14:56.077 --> 00:14:59.827
Just equality and tolerance?

327
00:14:59.827 --> 00:15:01.869
Or is there something much deeper?

328
00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:03.619
Like the opposite of hatred is love,

329
00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:04.786
faithfulness, justice,
integrity, what’s right.

330
00:15:04.786 --> 00:15:06.369
What are your values?

331
00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:09.036
What values do you want to teach
these children who have

332
00:15:09.036 --> 00:15:11.202
had a diet of hatred,
probably quite a lot

333
00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:15.077
of their childhood?

334
00:15:15.077 --> 00:15:17.494
In fact, we don’t know
that about them all,

335
00:15:17.494 --> 00:15:19.827
what kind of childhood they had,
or whether they had

336
00:15:19.827 --> 00:15:21.327
a diet of hatred or not.

337
00:15:21.327 --> 00:15:22.494
But I take your point.

338
00:15:22.494 --> 00:15:23.536
Yes, the woman there?

339
00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:27.077
So, I want to ask, really,
what makes people feel

340
00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:29.244
disenfranchised in the first place
which means, you know,

341
00:15:29.244 --> 00:15:31.952
before they even get to the prisons,
before that even happens.

342
00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:34.577
It used to be, under Labour,
that they had in communities

343
00:15:34.577 --> 00:15:37.202
where this might be a problem,
they had community officers that

344
00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:42.244
would come and talk to people
and it was in the policing.

345
00:15:43.702 --> 00:15:47.369
And that’s gone.

346
00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:49.994
And so now we’ve got
the far right happening,

347
00:15:49.994 --> 00:15:52.744
and you’ve got to wonder why
that is certainly rising again.

348
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:57.702
You know, it’sjust
the cuts, really, I think.

349
00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:00.077
The man in the blue shirt there.

350
00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:05.036
Convicted terrorists have alienated
themselves from civilised society.

351
00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:08.244
They are rightly in prison.

352
00:16:08.244 --> 00:16:10.411
I agree with the initiative
that has been taken,

353
00:16:10.411 --> 00:16:11.786
that they serve their full term.

354
00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:14.494
But at the very least,
the society must be satisfied that,

355
00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:19.452
before they’re let out
on the streets, 3 full risk

356
00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:22.744
assessment has been made
that they are able and capable

357
00:16:22.744 --> 00:16:26.244
to come on the streets
without being a risk to the public.

358
00:16:26.244 --> 00:16:28.827
Let me take one more
before I move on, the man

359
00:16:28.827 --> 00:16:31.577
at the back in the glasses.

360
00:16:31.577 --> 00:16:34.744
Yes, you, sir.

361
00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:37.411
I’d like to say, do the panel
feel there are three

362
00:16:37.411 --> 00:16:39.869
contributory factors?

363
00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:43.661
One, the increased mental health
that goes on in prison, two,

364
00:16:43.661 --> 00:16:46.119
the disproportionate number
of ethnic minorities,

365
00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:48.536
people that are in prison.

366
00:16:48.536 --> 00:16:50.202
And the severe cuts
within the services,

367
00:16:50.202 --> 00:16:52.119
especially up north in England,
which have been

368
00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:57.077
impoverished for so long.

369
00:16:58.202 --> 00:17:01.952
When will this government wake up?

370
00:17:01.952 --> 00:17:05.202
Do they not have a conscience?

371
00:17:05.202 --> 00:17:10.161
All right, OK, I’m
going to take one more.

372
00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:20.952
I support stopping the early
release, but I don’t have confidence

373
00:17:20.952 --> 00:17:22.869
about the de—radicalisation
programmes, and so, for me,

374
00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.994
it’s not enough, you know,
I think they should

375
00:17:24.994 --> 00:17:26.286
stay there, personally.

376
00:17:26.286 --> 00:17:28.452
So, Georgina, you were asking
whether this was just

377
00:17:28.452 --> 00:17:30.869
postponing the inevitable,
so you think they should be locked

378
00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:31.911
up indefinitely, these people?

379
00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:33.119
Is that what you’re suggesting?

380
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:36.161
Yeah, probably it is, yeah.

381
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:40.327
I mean, if someone is planning
to take someone’s life,

382
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:43.202
then I think they lose their right
to have a free—living life.

383
00:17:43.202 --> 00:17:45.619
Let me just ask one thing,
because you’ve been getting

384
00:17:45.619 --> 00:17:48.786
a bit of a battering,
but I want to ask a serious question

385
00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:52.369
— we know that there is one person
who is in prison at the moment

386
00:17:52.369 --> 00:17:54.952
and whose release is coming up
in a number of weeks,

387
00:17:54.952 --> 00:17:57.119
in three weeks’ time,
and you’re trying to get

388
00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:59.286
this emergency legislation
through to stop him coming out.

389
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:01.952
If you succeed, by my calculation,
he will be in prison

390
00:18:01.952 --> 00:18:05.786
until about this time next year,
so then what happens?

391
00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:07.952
This is the question,
and the sentencing process,

392
00:18:07.952 --> 00:18:12.577
obviously, is confined
to the sentence passed by the judge,

393
00:18:12.577 --> 00:18:14.952
and that might be an
element of custody, and then

394
00:18:14.952 --> 00:18:18.077
release on licence, we think
the Parole Board should be involved

395
00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:23.119
to do the risk assessment,
but there is a longer term issue,

396
00:18:24.077 --> 00:18:26.994
and if you remember, we had the big
debate about control orders,

397
00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:29.619
the Tpims introduced when Ed
and I were in government together.

398
00:18:29.619 --> 00:18:34.619
Big arguments about whether
that is right, bearing in mind

399
00:18:37.327 --> 00:18:39.494
is no conviction, offence
to attach those orders too.

400
00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:44.494
The management of extremism
in the community is something,

401
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:46.786
I think, we’re going
to have to grasp now.

402
00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.952
And we’ve tried, in the past,
with indeterminate sentences

403
00:18:48.952 --> 00:18:50.869
for public protection,
which I don’t think worked,

404
00:18:50.869 --> 00:18:54.744
because I think the judgments
that we asked judges to make

405
00:18:54.744 --> 00:18:57.036
were rather, frankly, crude,

406
00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.619
and have resulted, frankly,
in injustices.

407
00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:01.744
And I think therefore
what we need to do

408
00:19:01.744 --> 00:19:04.411
is calmly revisit that concept,
but develop it in a way,

409
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:06.577
as we have done with mental
health issues, actually,

410
00:19:06.577 --> 00:19:09.702
and the way in which we deal
with people with a mental health

411
00:19:09.702 --> 00:19:11.786
problem in the criminaljustice
system, and work out

412
00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:16.369
a system where we can assess risk,
protect the public,

413
00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:20.786
but also balance that
against the rule of law,

414
00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:23.452
and those due process issues
that do matter

415
00:19:23.452 --> 00:19:28.411
and make us a civilised society,
make us better than the terrorists,

416
00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:30.994
make us different
and mean that we have something

417
00:19:30.994 --> 00:19:33.619
that is worth defending against
people who seek to divide us,

418
00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:36.869
murder us or injure us.

419
00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:39.786
0K, Robert, thank you.

420
00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:40.952
APPLAUSE.

421
00:19:40.952 --> 00:19:43.869
I’m going to move on,
because we have a lot of questions

422
00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:46.786
on a whole variety of subjects,
so I’m going to try to

423
00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:49.411
get to as many as I can,
but I just want to say

424
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:54.286
get to as many as I can,
but I just want to say

425
00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:57.411
where we will be next week,
which is Dundee, and will bejoined

426
00:19:57.411 --> 00:20:00.286
by the crime writer Val McDermid,
and the following week will be

427
00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:02.911
in Weymouth with the chairman
of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

428
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.619
Howard Davies, and political
commentator, train enthusiast

429
00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:08.244
and former Tory Cabinet Secretary
Michael Portillo.

430
00:20:08.244 --> 00:20:11.161
So if you want to be
in the audience, call or go

431
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:13.577
to the Question Time website
and follow the instructions there.

432
00:20:13.577 --> 00:20:16.911
Do come along if you are in the area
for either of those programmes.

433
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:17.952
Right, let’s move on.

434
00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:21.286
As I say, a lot of topics
I want to try and get through.

435
00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:22.369
Daniel Warr.

436
00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:24.286
The announcement this week
that fossil fuel cars

437
00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:27.161
will be banned in 2035,
what is the Government going to do

438
00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:30.119
to incentivise us to change cars?

439
00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:33.202
Right, well, Robert,
we have had you speaking a lot,

440
00:20:33.202 --> 00:20:36.286
so I will go around the panel
for a minute.

441
00:20:36.286 --> 00:20:38.911
Ed, what do you think should be
done to incentivise us

442
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:39.952
to buy electric cars?

443
00:20:39.952 --> 00:20:42.911
Well, I want to make sure
there are a lot cheaper,

444
00:20:42.911 --> 00:20:45.036
and that’s why the Government
is actually not being

445
00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:46.327
ambitious enough.

446
00:20:46.327 --> 00:20:48.952
The Liberal Democrats want
that ban to take place from 2030,

447
00:20:48.952 --> 00:20:50.952
like many other countries.

448
00:20:50.952 --> 00:20:53.827
If you look at what is happening
in the Netherlands, in Sweden,

449
00:20:53.827 --> 00:20:56.077
in Denmark, in Ireland,
in Germany,

450
00:20:56.077 --> 00:20:58.494
they’re all looking at 2030.

451
00:20:58.494 --> 00:21:03.494
Norway has actually gone for 2025.

452
00:21:04.786 --> 00:21:06.744
They’ve got an awful lot
more electric cars

453
00:21:06.744 --> 00:21:08.577
than we have at the moment.

454
00:21:08.577 --> 00:21:10.452
Yes, because they’ve actually
incentivised things.

455
00:21:10.452 --> 00:21:14.452
But the point I’m making is
we need to get these manufacturers

456
00:21:14.452 --> 00:21:16.619
to produce the electric cars
and the ultralow emission

457
00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:18.994
vehicles much cheaper,
and if we give them that earlier

458
00:21:18.994 --> 00:21:21.411
timetable, as other countries
are doing, they’ll all be forced

459
00:21:21.411 --> 00:21:24.994
to produce them on a mass scale that
will mean there is a much greater

460
00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:26.452
choice, the price will come down.

461
00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:29.077
When I was Secretary of State
for Energy and Climate Change,

462
00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.536
we did that with offshore wind.

463
00:21:30.536 --> 00:21:34.661
We helped create an industry
by bringing factories to Hull,

464
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:37.036
which created huge amounts
of green jobs, but it also

465
00:21:37.036 --> 00:21:39.452
helped build the supply chain,
to make it more competitive.

466
00:21:39.452 --> 00:21:41.827
We saw the cost of offshore wind
come down dramatically,

467
00:21:41.827 --> 00:21:43.786
so we’ve got a lot more green power.

468
00:21:43.786 --> 00:21:46.161
We need to do those sorts
of systems in transport,

469
00:21:46.161 --> 00:21:50.036
so you can be driving much
cheaper, cleaner vehicles.

470
00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:53.702
Daniel, what would you
like to see happen?

471
00:21:53.702 --> 00:21:54.952
Well, basically, I don’t think

472
00:21:54.952 --> 00:21:57.286
we’ve got the infrastructure
at all for it.

473
00:21:57.286 --> 00:22:01.077
APPLAUSE.

474
00:22:01.077 --> 00:22:04.202
I think it’s unachievable,
because on the 1st of January 2036,

475
00:22:04.202 --> 00:22:07.869
you’re still going to be able
to drive your petrol car,

476
00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:10.536
they’re not going to stop you
going to a petrol station,

477
00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:14.702
so it’s going to make
no difference to climate change.

478
00:22:14.702 --> 00:22:18.911
This is all about new cars,
isn’t it?

479
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:21.327
That’s right, it’s about new cars,
and people can’t afford

480
00:22:21.327 --> 00:22:26.327
to buy new cars,
because they are so expensive.

481
00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:30.786
Therre so much more expensive than
your standard

482
00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:31.827
diesel or petrol cars.

483
00:22:31.827 --> 00:22:33.327
Can I reassure Daniel?
Briefly, Ed.

484
00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:36.161
I want to let other people
on the panel talk as well.

485
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:38.994
They will be able to be charged
overnight at your own home

486
00:22:38.994 --> 00:22:40.244
using much cheaper overnight
electricity,

487
00:22:40.244 --> 00:22:42.161
so in many ways we can do it...

488
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:44.786
You are talking about the cost
ofjust buying the car.

489
00:22:44.786 --> 00:22:46.452
Where is the cheaper
electricity coming from?

490
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:49.369
The thing is, this isjust tinkering
around the edges, isn’t it?

491
00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:51.994
You know, looking at the climate
crisis is the most urgent

492
00:22:51.994 --> 00:22:56.161
and pressing issue of our time.

493
00:22:56.161 --> 00:22:59.161
We don’t have long to deal with it.

494
00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:01.827
And they kind of changes
that we are talking about,

495
00:23:01.827 --> 00:23:03.786
you’re asking about how
we can incentivise people.

496
00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:08.744
Well, we do need to do that,
and that needs state intervention.

497
00:23:09.244 --> 00:23:12.286
It needs state—directed policy
to make it easier in all kinds

498
00:23:12.286 --> 00:23:17.327
of ways for people to
make greener choices,

499
00:23:18.036 --> 00:23:21.202
and I think that the blueprint
that the Labour Party came up with,

500
00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:24.786
the green new deal,
is precisely that.

501
00:23:24.786 --> 00:23:26.952
It is a state intervention,
all kinds of things,

502
00:23:26.952 --> 00:23:31.077
it is also 3 jobs creation
programme, and whether that’s

503
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:35.119
like gigafactories making battery
packs for electric cars or wind

504
00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:37.286
turbine factories in the north—east
or metal reprocessing plants

505
00:23:37.286 --> 00:23:42.286
or carbon capture factories,
whatever it is, that’s the scale

506
00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:47.119
of what we need, and that has to be
a state—directed thing.

507
00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:49.536
We can’tjust expect people
to switch without providing that

508
00:23:49.536 --> 00:23:54.536
kind of level of intervention.

509
00:23:55.077 --> 00:23:57.244
OK, so, Robert, how
are you going to incentivise

510
00:23:57.244 --> 00:24:01.202
people to change cars?

511
00:24:01.202 --> 00:24:03.786
I mean, there is at the moment
a grant knocking 3500

512
00:24:03.786 --> 00:24:06.244
off the price of a car,
as I understand it.

513
00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:11.202
You are phasing that out next month.

514
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:14.994
Yeah, but we’re also introducing...

515
00:24:14.994 --> 00:24:17.869
Are you going to go ahead with that
phasing down next month?

516
00:24:17.869 --> 00:24:19.869
What we are changing
is the availability

517
00:24:19.869 --> 00:24:22.036
of infrastructure and actually
making sure that we have

518
00:24:22.036 --> 00:24:25.786
more charging points.

519
00:24:25.786 --> 00:24:27.744
Hang on, the point Daniel
was making is

520
00:24:27.744 --> 00:24:32.452
that these cars are very expensive.

521
00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:34.827
The Government at the moment
has a subsidy to help

522
00:24:34.827 --> 00:24:36.119
people buy the cars.

523
00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:38.744
You’ve just made this announcement
that were all going to have

524
00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:41.411
to buy new cars from 2035,
they have to be electric,

525
00:24:41.411 --> 00:24:44.036
and you’re going ahead with phasing
out the subsidy next month.

526
00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:46.411
Because we think there’s
a better way of doing it,

527
00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:48.202
which is actually...

528
00:24:48.202 --> 00:24:50.827
One of the barriers, I think,
a lot of people feel

529
00:24:50.827 --> 00:24:53.744
about electric vehicles is the ease
by which they can be recharged.

530
00:24:53.744 --> 00:24:55.661
Well, cost is the one
that Daniel mentioned.

531
00:24:55.661 --> 00:25:00.661
But I think, by scaling
up the infrastructure,

532
00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:05.994
it means that more people will start
to buy electric cars,

533
00:25:05.994 --> 00:25:08.911
and without scale of demand,
then the price starts to come down.

534
00:25:08.911 --> 00:25:11.577
I think that is the way
we’re going to do this.

535
00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:13.494
We’ve got 15 years...
I think you’ve described...

536
00:25:13.494 --> 00:25:15.827
With respect, you characterise the
Government’s approach to this issue.

537
00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:19.869
There is plenty of direct
intervention that is going

538
00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:24.786
on every year when it comes
to the incentivisation of...

539
00:25:24.786 --> 00:25:27.286
Which won’t be the
scale that we need.

540
00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:31.286
And in fact our record as a country,
and all of us have played our part

541
00:25:31.286 --> 00:25:33.661
in this, is second to none
when it comes to

542
00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:36.536
the move to renewable energy.

543
00:25:36.536 --> 00:25:38.744
The next challenge is transport,
because transport is now

544
00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:41.827
the bulk of those carbon emissions,
which is why I think it’s right

545
00:25:41.827 --> 00:25:43.536
that we’ve brought
forward to that target,

546
00:25:43.536 --> 00:25:45.911
and I think that by scaling
up the infrastructure,

547
00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:49.577
we will start to see that change not
just to battery but to hydrogen,

548
00:25:49.577 --> 00:25:53.827
to a range of different sources
of renewable energy,

549
00:25:53.827 --> 00:25:58.827
which I think is a much more
sustainable way of going forward.

550
00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:02.369
You know, we could be
ambitious and bring forward

551
00:26:02.369 --> 00:26:05.536
the target even more,
but we have to get the balance

552
00:26:05.536 --> 00:26:08.661
right, we have to respect the fact
that there are people out there

553
00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:11.036
who need to have that
financial access to these vehicles.

554
00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:13.202
I believe the proposals
that we’ve come up with

555
00:26:13.202 --> 00:26:16.036
strike the appropriate balance.

556
00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:19.869
Just so I’m clear, because
there’s been talk about the fact

557
00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:22.786
that even though this grant
was going to be scrapped, it might

558
00:26:22.786 --> 00:26:25.452
be reintroduced in the Budget,
but that’s not going to happen,

559
00:26:25.452 --> 00:26:27.619
the subsidy for buying electric
cars, given your announcement

560
00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:30.494
we are all going to be buying them,
that subsidy is going?

561
00:26:30.494 --> 00:26:33.369
Well, I can’tjudge what is going
to happen in the Budget,

562
00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:36.244
that is for my colleague
the Chancellor, but what I can say

563
00:26:36.244 --> 00:26:38.161
is that I think it’s true
infrastructure improvements

564
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:41.869
that we really start to see
a scaling up of electric vehicles.

565
00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:44.952
Adam. It is one thing saying
all this, but we don’t have

566
00:26:44.952 --> 00:26:49.911
the infrastructure and saying,
oh, you can charge your car

567
00:26:53.036 --> 00:26:55.286
at home really easily,

568
00:26:55.286 --> 00:26:58.161
I can charge most of my mobile
devices at home really easily.

569
00:26:58.161 --> 00:27:00.827
The fact is the battery
runs out and what then?

570
00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:03.494
How many charging terminals do
we need for how many cars

571
00:27:03.494 --> 00:27:06.536
that are going to be kind
of on the roads?

572
00:27:06.536 --> 00:27:08.244
Pushing the price down is one thing,

573
00:27:08.244 --> 00:27:11.619
and a market led approach is great,
but they don’t always work.

574
00:27:11.619 --> 00:27:14.786
I refused to believe that companies
who make electric cars

575
00:27:14.786 --> 00:27:19.119
are going to take a massive hit
on that profit margin,

576
00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.244
because the Government has
asked them to do it.

577
00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:23.077
So once again,
these are wonderful ideas,

578
00:27:23.077 --> 00:27:26.661
but how many electric terminals
do we need?

579
00:27:26.661 --> 00:27:31.702
How many electric cars do we expect
there to be on our roads by 2030?

580
00:27:33.286 --> 00:27:36.827
What do we expect the price to be
by then, and how accessible is it

581
00:27:36.827 --> 00:27:39.744
going to be for people,
and is it a cheaper alternative to

582
00:27:39.744 --> 00:27:40.911
the traditional fossil fuel method?

583
00:27:40.911 --> 00:27:45.911
And if it isn’t, why would anyone
in their right mind go for it?

584
00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:56.036
There is a lot of hands up,
the woman in the glasses.

585
00:28:00.202 --> 00:28:02.619
As well as focusing on electric
vehicles, surely we need

586
00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:03.827
to sort out public transport.

587
00:28:03.827 --> 00:28:06.452
Around here, the buses have been
cut, from the villages sometimes

588
00:28:06.452 --> 00:28:07.702
there’s only one day.

589
00:28:07.702 --> 00:28:09.869
The trains for Harpenden
particularly,

590
00:28:09.869 --> 00:28:11.577
there are fewer trains
than we were,

591
00:28:11.577 --> 00:28:14.786
so surely we need to
focus on that as well.

592
00:28:14.786 --> 00:28:19.827
The woman with glasses in the front.
Yes, you.

593
00:28:22.661 --> 00:28:24.994
I’m just wondering,
I know we’re all trying to move

594
00:28:24.994 --> 00:28:27.161
towards electric cars,
but then what do we do

595
00:28:27.161 --> 00:28:28.202
with the batteries?

596
00:28:28.202 --> 00:28:30.827
Isn’t that another environmental
problem that you have to deal with?

597
00:28:30.827 --> 00:28:32.286
The man in the bluejacket.

598
00:28:32.286 --> 00:28:33.327
APPLAUSE.

599
00:28:33.327 --> 00:28:35.911
0h, hi.

600
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:38.577
Yeah, one thing we do know
is the number of trees

601
00:28:38.577 --> 00:28:41.202
that we need to plant,
which I think is 1.5 billion,

602
00:28:41.202 --> 00:28:42.869
and I think that we are planting

603
00:28:42.869 --> 00:28:45.577
about 25% of what we need
at the moment.

604
00:28:45.577 --> 00:28:47.202
Could we do more there?

605
00:28:47.202 --> 00:28:50.369
0K, let me hearfrom the man
in the greyjacket, yes.

606
00:28:50.369 --> 00:28:52.744
There’s lots of pressure on us
as individuals to make

607
00:28:52.744 --> 00:28:54.661
changes our lifestyles,
but when will major companies

608
00:28:54.661 --> 00:28:59.702
and corporations be held
accountable for their actions?

609
00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:04.411
OK, you mean in terms of polluting?
Yeah.

610
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:07.869
Stella? We have all got to move to
electric cars at some point, surely.

611
00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:10.744
Everyone is piling into
the Government on this,

612
00:29:10.744 --> 00:29:13.119
and we can talk about the subsidy
and the timing,

613
00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:16.494
but eventually this has
to happen, doesn’t it?

614
00:29:16.494 --> 00:29:19.869
Well, also, look, there’s a cost
to all of us of not doing is,

615
00:29:19.869 --> 00:29:22.744
and I speak as somebody who,
probably like a lot of you,

616
00:29:22.744 --> 00:29:25.411
bought a diesel car thinking
I was doing the right thing,

617
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:27.994
yes, madam, we both thought
we were doing the right thing!

618
00:29:27.994 --> 00:29:32.202
We don’t have time to wait.

619
00:29:32.202 --> 00:29:37.202
We know that
the climate emergency is real,

620
00:29:41.161 --> 00:29:43.744
and we know that transport
is part of it.

621
00:29:43.744 --> 00:29:45.661
The lady at the back
is absolutely right,

622
00:29:45.661 --> 00:29:48.786
it’s notjust about electric cars,
it’s also about the fact that people

623
00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:51.661
have to have cars because transport
in this country is so poor.

624
00:29:51.661 --> 00:29:53.327
You have to join the dots together.

625
00:29:53.327 --> 00:29:55.744
That’s where good active government
can get involved in this.

626
00:29:55.744 --> 00:29:58.869
I don’t know if we’re going to go
on to talk about Glasgow

627
00:29:58.869 --> 00:30:01.244
and the climate change conference,
it’s where you do need

628
00:30:01.244 --> 00:30:03.869
the leadership, and time after time,
I have to be honest,

629
00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:05.327
this government has not been there.

630
00:30:05.327 --> 00:30:07.494
They’ve said, oh, we have
this market led approach,

631
00:30:07.494 --> 00:30:09.661
but they’ve not been active players
in that market,

632
00:30:09.661 --> 00:30:11.577
and that’s the way to make it work.

633
00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:14.494
We need to have a scrappage scheme
for cars, because it isn’t

634
00:30:14.494 --> 00:30:16.869
just about new cars,
it is about getting the old

635
00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:18.036
polluting cars off the roads.

636
00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:20.744
But we also need those subsidies,
and we need to incentivise

637
00:30:20.744 --> 00:30:23.119
the gigafactories that make
the factories that make the cars

638
00:30:23.119 --> 00:30:26.202
cheaper, because I looked up how
much it would cost for an electric

639
00:30:26.202 --> 00:30:29.577
car and saw the number of dots
at the end of it, you know,

640
00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:31.744
these things are all possible,
but they require planning

641
00:30:31.744 --> 00:30:34.869
by government to say, actually,
were notjust going to wait and see

642
00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:37.244
what happens and hope that
people can find the cash

643
00:30:37.244 --> 00:30:39.661
to make this happen,
we’re going to do this actively.

644
00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:42.286
Because if we don’t,
not just the cost to our economy,

645
00:30:42.286 --> 00:30:43.744
but they cost to our breathing.

646
00:30:43.744 --> 00:30:46.119
I would say to people,
I represent a London constituency,

647
00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:48.036
and when people are concerned
about environmental issues,

648
00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:50.744
I say to them, leave London
for a couple of days,

649
00:30:50.744 --> 00:30:52.869
then blow your nose and realise
what your breathing

650
00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:54.577
in and what we have to change.

651
00:30:54.577 --> 00:30:57.869
We don’t have time to mess around,
we have to do all of this,

652
00:30:57.869 --> 00:31:00.577
because all of us will pay the price
for a government

653
00:31:00.577 --> 00:31:04.119
that is going to sit back and wait
for you to pick up the tab.

654
00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:06.577
With that charming image
in mind, can Ijust ask,

655
00:31:06.577 --> 00:31:08.744
does anyone on the panel
have an electric car?

656
00:31:08.744 --> 00:31:09.786
You do?

657
00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:11.452
And how is it working for you?

658
00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:12.494
I love it.

659
00:31:12.494 --> 00:31:13.911
But I live up the road.

660
00:31:13.911 --> 00:31:18.869
There is one charging
station in all of Harpenden.

661
00:31:19.286 --> 00:31:21.619
And there is always a bunch
of electric vehicles queueing,

662
00:31:21.619 --> 00:31:23.494
waiting to charge.

663
00:31:23.494 --> 00:31:27.077
So it’s not about scaling
up the infrastructure.

664
00:31:27.077 --> 00:31:29.119
The infrastructure needs
to be there already.

665
00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:34.077
There are 18,000 registered
private EV owners in Hertfordshire.

666
00:31:34.077 --> 00:31:37.411
And you can count on just two hands
the number of chargers there are.

667
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:42.452
So it’s utterly ridiculous.

668
00:31:42.536 --> 00:31:43.911
My car is six years old.

669
00:31:43.911 --> 00:31:45.536
It’s not new technology.

670
00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:48.619
If you bought a new car,
if you bought a new diesel car,

671
00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:52.202
but you had to drive way out
of your way to go and fill it

672
00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:56.869
with diesel, you wouldn’t buy it.
the affordability.

673
00:31:56.869 --> 00:31:58.327
Mine was very affordable.

674
00:31:58.327 --> 00:32:00.827
But there was nowhere to charge it.

675
00:32:00.827 --> 00:32:03.494
And I live in a block
of flats, I don’t have

676
00:32:03.494 --> 00:32:05.494
a driveway to charge it on.

677
00:32:05.494 --> 00:32:09.202
How many of you here are commuters?

678
00:32:09.202 --> 00:32:13.036
A lot of it is notjust about having
a car or having a bus service,

679
00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:16.119
it’s about where you want to travel
and why you want to travel,

680
00:32:16.119 --> 00:32:18.577
and making it easier
for people to work from home

681
00:32:18.577 --> 00:32:20.744
so that we are travelling
where we need to.

682
00:32:20.744 --> 00:32:23.161
And if we could get our train
service working properly...

683
00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:26.452
APPLAUSE

684
00:32:26.452 --> 00:32:30.244
Let’s not make this a free for all.

685
00:32:30.244 --> 00:32:31.786
Let me move on.

686
00:32:31.786 --> 00:32:33.952
I’m going to take another question
from Tanya Powell—Jones.

687
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:34.952
Tanya, whereabouts are you?

688
00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.869
Has impeachment helped or hindered
Donald Trump’s election

689
00:32:36.869 --> 00:32:40.911
campaign, should we care?

690
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:41.952
Do you care, Tanya?

691
00:32:41.952 --> 00:32:42.994
I do care, yes.

692
00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:43.577
And what is your view?

693
00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:47.119
I think it has helped.

694
00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:49.952
It plays into the idea of him
versus them for his voters.

695
00:32:49.952 --> 00:32:52.661
And what makes you care
about it, why do you think

696
00:32:52.661 --> 00:32:53.702
we should care here?

697
00:32:53.702 --> 00:32:55.369
Because I think it
devalues the impeachment.

698
00:32:55.369 --> 00:32:57.994
That wasn’t the purpose
of what it was meant to be.

699
00:32:57.994 --> 00:33:00.619
If it can be used like this
as a political tool,

700
00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:02.077
what does that mean going forward?

701
00:33:02.077 --> 00:33:03.786
Adam?
what is your view on this?

702
00:33:03.786 --> 00:33:08.327
I think anything you throw
at 3 Donald Trump at this pointjust

703
00:33:08.327 --> 00:33:11.036
isn’t going to stick.

704
00:33:11.036 --> 00:33:14.661
At this point, he is a mud monster,
and just throwing more mud at him

705
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:16.286
will make him stronger.

706
00:33:16.286 --> 00:33:18.202
I have no idea how he
survived impeachment.

707
00:33:18.202 --> 00:33:22.036
Well, it’s the number of Republicans
in the Senate, I think,

708
00:33:22.036 --> 00:33:24.744
is how he survived it.

709
00:33:24.744 --> 00:33:27.119
It was 3 numbers game
in the end, wasn’t it?

710
00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:28.702
Yeah, I guess that is true.

711
00:33:28.702 --> 00:33:32.244
But it’s just...

712
00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:37.286
I don’t know, it hasjust given him
more momentum going into the real

713
00:33:38.577 --> 00:33:39.577
election that is happening.

714
00:33:39.577 --> 00:33:43.119
And it’s just really baffling to me.

715
00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:45.786
I don’t know how he got
in the first place, even.

716
00:33:45.786 --> 00:33:47.952
Do you think it matters to us here?

717
00:33:47.952 --> 00:33:50.827
Well, we are going to be negotiating
with whoever wins this 2020

718
00:33:50.827 --> 00:33:52.369
election on a trade deal.

719
00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:55.702
And back in April, Barack Obama said
it could take up to ten years

720
00:33:55.702 --> 00:34:00.744
to negotiate such a trade deal
with the US.

721
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:03.536
And there has been research
done that, on average,

722
00:34:03.536 --> 00:34:05.452
any country entering trade
negotiations with the US,

723
00:34:05.452 --> 00:34:07.661
on average, takes five years.

724
00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:10.369
I mean, Donald Trump is much
more bullish about it.

725
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:12.536
Yes, exactly, so it will
likely be more than that.

726
00:34:12.536 --> 00:34:15.119
One and a half years negotiating,
three and a half implementation.

727
00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:20.119
And so, yes, I think it does matter.

728
00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:21.786
And so, yes, I think it does matter.

729
00:34:21.786 --> 00:34:24.411
I think the individual
in the White House that we are

730
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:26.952
negotiating with once we leave
the EU properly, at the end

731
00:34:26.952 --> 00:34:30.202
of December, absolutely
matters to our country.

732
00:34:30.202 --> 00:34:31.244
0K.

733
00:34:31.244 --> 00:34:32.411
Ed?

734
00:34:32.411 --> 00:34:35.577
Sorry, I’lljust come to Ed
and then I will come to you.

735
00:34:35.577 --> 00:34:37.744
I think it may have improved his
re—election chances,

736
00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:38.911
and I deeply regret that.

737
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:43.869
Because we should care about it.

738
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:51.786
Because this man in the White House
is one of the biggest

739
00:34:51.786 --> 00:34:53.661
blocks to action on things
like climate change.

740
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:56.619
This man in the White House
is actually, with his foreign

741
00:34:56.619 --> 00:34:58.494
policy, created great instability
in places like North Korea,

742
00:34:58.494 --> 00:34:59.536
and the Middle East.

743
00:34:59.536 --> 00:35:01.452
As a progressive politician,
I find his approach

744
00:35:01.452 --> 00:35:03.327
to women, to Muslims,
to Mexicans, quite outrageous.

745
00:35:03.327 --> 00:35:04.827
I hope he loses in November.

746
00:35:04.827 --> 00:35:07.702
I think that would be a real step
forward for the world,

747
00:35:07.702 --> 00:35:10.786
and for those of us who care
about the rights of ordinary people.

748
00:35:10.786 --> 00:35:11.786
APPLAUSE

749
00:35:11.786 --> 00:35:13.869
Do you think that is likely?

750
00:35:13.869 --> 00:35:17.411
I think it’s very difficult
to tell at the moment.

751
00:35:17.411 --> 00:35:20.077
I think we are still waiting
to see who the Democrat

752
00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:21.411
choice for President is.

753
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:24.327
I hope they choose someone
who can beat Donald Trump,

754
00:35:24.327 --> 00:35:27.411
because that is in the interests
of everyone, the rest of the world.

755
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:28.994
Rachel?

756
00:35:28.994 --> 00:35:32.619
Well, it might have helped him, but
it was still the right thing to do.

757
00:35:32.619 --> 00:35:35.244
You know, because he did abuse
the power of his office,

758
00:35:35.244 --> 00:35:36.286
and it was corrupt.

759
00:35:36.286 --> 00:35:41.286
So, the Democrats were
right to pursue it.

760
00:35:56.994 --> 00:35:58.911
I don’t think they
could have ignored it.

761
00:35:58.911 --> 00:36:02.286
But what we sawjust now, that
was not a trial, with the Senate.

762
00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:03.494
A trial with no witnesses?

763
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:04.536
No documentation?

764
00:36:04.536 --> 00:36:05.577
APPLAUSE

765
00:36:05.577 --> 00:36:07.744
And they had John Bolton,
Republican, willing to testify.

766
00:36:07.744 --> 00:36:10.369
Saying, hey, by the way,
I want to testify, I’ve got

767
00:36:10.369 --> 00:36:13.119
something to say about this.

768
00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:15.786
Another way of looking
at it is that is their system,

769
00:36:15.786 --> 00:36:17.744
and they went along
with their system, this

770
00:36:17.744 --> 00:36:19.369
is the result you got.

771
00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:21.744
Well, they went along
with their system, and I think

772
00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:23.661
that is to their shame.

773
00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:26.994
The fact that they were prepared
to have a trial that wasn’t a trial,

774
00:36:26.994 --> 00:36:29.119
I think everybody can see that,
everybody can see

775
00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:30.202
what happened there.

776
00:36:30.202 --> 00:36:31.244
And does it matter?

777
00:36:31.244 --> 00:36:34.077
Yes, of course it does.

778
00:36:34.077 --> 00:36:36.786
I think for people
who are progressives,

779
00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:40.369
leftists or liberals,
there aren’t that many reasons to be

780
00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:43.786
cheerful right now, globally.

781
00:36:43.786 --> 00:36:47.119
So we are all watching
the US election, you know,

782
00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.702
and kind of willing the Democrats
to just get it together

783
00:36:49.702 --> 00:36:53.786
and win this time.

784
00:36:53.786 --> 00:36:56.911
The man in the front,
in the purple tie?

785
00:36:56.911 --> 00:36:59.786
We can say that is the system,
but we are also dependent

786
00:36:59.786 --> 00:37:02.119
on the integrity of the individuals.

787
00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:06.202
Donald Trump did abuse his office
in the way that he was accused of.

788
00:37:06.202 --> 00:37:08.119
Mitt Romney recognised that,
and with some integrity

789
00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:13.077
voted for impeachment.

790
00:37:14.452 --> 00:37:17.619
And the rest of the Republicans
said, in effect, yes, he may be

791
00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:20.202
a bully, but he’s our bully,
he is on our side,

792
00:37:20.202 --> 00:37:21.911
so we are going to support him.

793
00:37:21.911 --> 00:37:22.911
That’s what’s going on.

794
00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:26.119
The woman in the green
dress, green top?

795
00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:28.994
I’m worried that our Prime Minister
is beginning to resemble the man

796
00:37:28.994 --> 00:37:33.994
in the White House in his treatment
of minorities, but also press

797
00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:41.994
freedom,
and how he treated journalists

798
00:37:41.994 --> 00:37:44.411
the other day and refused them
entry into the briefing.

799
00:37:44.411 --> 00:37:45.494
Right.

800
00:37:45.494 --> 00:37:46.536
APPLAUSE

801
00:37:46.536 --> 00:37:47.702
We may come onto that.

802
00:37:47.702 --> 00:37:51.077
I know that is a thing that a number
of you have talked about.

803
00:37:51.077 --> 00:37:52.994
Let’s stick with Donald
Trump for a moment.

804
00:37:52.994 --> 00:37:55.161
Stella, has the impeachment helped
or hindered his campaign?

805
00:37:55.161 --> 00:37:56.161
Should we care?

806
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:58.619
Yes, I think we should care,
because when you normalise

807
00:37:58.619 --> 00:38:00.786
politics without rules,
it has consequences for making it

808
00:38:00.786 --> 00:38:02.869
look more acceptable
in other parts of the world.

809
00:38:05.744 --> 00:38:09.119
I mean, I think you are right, sir,
who would have thought a couple

810
00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:11.536
of years ago that Mitt Romney
would appear to be

811
00:38:11.536 --> 00:38:12.536
a progressive hero?

812
00:38:12.536 --> 00:38:13.994
But he did the right thing.

813
00:38:13.994 --> 00:38:17.119
He said what he thought was right
and he will take the consequences

814
00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:18.161
in the Republican movement.

815
00:38:18.161 --> 00:38:20.994
We are in a politics right now,
there are very many tactics

816
00:38:20.994 --> 00:38:23.161
in American politics that
are being imported into British

817
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:25.827
politics in terms of how people
campaign, in terms of people’s

818
00:38:25.827 --> 00:38:27.494
arguments about whether experts
and expertise matter.

819
00:38:27.494 --> 00:38:30.161
I think we should all be worried,
because it is driven

820
00:38:30.161 --> 00:38:31.827
in America so much by money.

821
00:38:31.827 --> 00:38:35.411
It’s not driven by democracy.

822
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:38.411
And actually we are seeing that
in the Democrat movement as well.

823
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:41.286
What I worry about is that once
somebody has been able, essentially,

824
00:38:41.286 --> 00:38:43.869
to get away with it once,
why not do it again?

825
00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:46.036
And why not then, in this
country, start saying,

826
00:38:46.036 --> 00:38:49.702
well, you know what,
actually, if in America people don’t

827
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.036
accept having all the press
there and difficult press scrutiny,

828
00:38:52.036 --> 00:38:57.077
why not do that here?

829
00:39:00.036 --> 00:39:03.411
If it’s OK to not have clarity
about what you are doing

830
00:39:03.411 --> 00:39:05.327
with your Russian oligarchs
in America, why not

831
00:39:05.327 --> 00:39:08.244
do that in the UK?

832
00:39:08.244 --> 00:39:11.119
It becomes a very slippery slope.

833
00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.577
All of us, as politicians, should
always be slightly uncomfortable

834
00:39:13.577 --> 00:39:14.786
that we are being scrutinised.

835
00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.702
That is a good thing.

836
00:39:16.702 --> 00:39:18.827
I don’t think that Donald Trump
feels that tonight,

837
00:39:18.827 --> 00:39:21.702
and that is a bad thing.

838
00:39:21.702 --> 00:39:23.244
APPLAUSE

839
00:39:23.244 --> 00:39:26.827
Is that your view?

840
00:39:26.827 --> 00:39:29.411
Is that the Government view?

841
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:34.036
I do agree with Stella
about the sense of discomfort.

842
00:39:34.036 --> 00:39:37.452
I think that is absolutely the place
that all of us need to be.

843
00:39:37.452 --> 00:39:40.327
The great thing about our system
is that, you know, I can’t

844
00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:42.411
sit in an ivory tower.

845
00:39:42.411 --> 00:39:44.786
I have to come and answer
to colleagues at questions,

846
00:39:44.786 --> 00:39:47.411
and indeed to make statements,
and be held accountable upon that.

847
00:39:47.411 --> 00:39:50.077
I think whilst I’m not
going to get into the weeds

848
00:39:50.077 --> 00:39:52.494
of the American campaign,
I think their system is, should

849
00:39:52.494 --> 00:39:55.411
we say, a rather interesting one.

850
00:39:55.411 --> 00:39:58.786
In that, in a genuine attempt to try
and get separation of powers right,

851
00:39:58.786 --> 00:40:02.119
the executive power of the President
does mean that he or she is rather

852
00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:07.119
remote, I think, from what goes
on day—to—day on the hill.

853
00:40:11.327 --> 00:40:13.952
But what has happened in American
politics is that the tradition

854
00:40:13.952 --> 00:40:16.369
of working across the aisle,
which was a huge part

855
00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:19.244
of the United States Senate for most
of its history, has gone.

856
00:40:19.244 --> 00:40:24.202
We have heard about Mitt Romney.

857
00:40:25.786 --> 00:40:29.619
He is a real throwback to a past
that is within living

858
00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:32.244
memory of many of us,
when the great men and women

859
00:40:32.244 --> 00:40:34.661
of the Senate actually
put their hands across the aisle

860
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:36.786
and worked together
for the United States of America.

861
00:40:36.786 --> 00:40:39.494
Now, that has vanished.

862
00:40:39.494 --> 00:40:43.827
And a lesson for us,
I think, is this.

863
00:40:43.827 --> 00:40:46.952
In all the partisan hurly—burly
we have had over the last few years,

864
00:40:46.952 --> 00:40:50.077
I think all of us need to look
in the mirror, as politicians

865
00:40:50.077 --> 00:40:52.744
here in the UK, and remember
that there is so much

866
00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:53.786
that unites us.

867
00:40:53.786 --> 00:40:58.786
We are all trying to
get to the same goal.

868
00:41:00.077 --> 00:41:05.119
We might disagree about the means
by which we do it, but we are,

869
00:41:05.786 --> 00:41:08.452
and should be, men and women
of honour and, yes, trust.

870
00:41:08.452 --> 00:41:13.411
Now, that’s been a really difficult
thing for a lot of people recently.

871
00:41:13.702 --> 00:41:16.536
That sense of discomfort
is what I think we need to hold

872
00:41:16.536 --> 00:41:19.411
onto as we learn the lessons of some
of the extreme politics

873
00:41:19.411 --> 00:41:21.577
that we are seeing,
notjust in the USA,

874
00:41:21.577 --> 00:41:24.369
but also closer to home.

875
00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:27.536
Do you feel that sense of discomfort
in terms of doing a deal

876
00:41:27.536 --> 00:41:32.494
with Donald Trump, then?

877
00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:36.244
If you are in some discomfort
about what you have just witnessed?

878
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:37.327
Today, with the impeachment?

879
00:41:37.327 --> 00:41:39.702
I think the Government has
shown its independence of mind

880
00:41:39.702 --> 00:41:40.744
on issues like Huawei.

881
00:41:40.744 --> 00:41:42.869
We are far from assuming
the position of supplicant...

882
00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:45.036
I’m not suggesting that,
I’m talking about the discomfort.

883
00:41:45.036 --> 00:41:46.077
Or mindlessly following on...

884
00:41:46.077 --> 00:41:48.952
Look, you have to deal with
the President of the United States,

885
00:41:48.952 --> 00:41:50.161
whoever they happen to be.

886
00:41:50.161 --> 00:41:51.369
The office is the office.

887
00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:52.786
Now, I’ve got my personal views.

888
00:41:52.786 --> 00:41:53.827
Ooh, let’s hear them.

889
00:41:53.827 --> 00:41:54.869
Come on!

890
00:41:54.869 --> 00:41:55.911
LAUGHTER.

891
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:58.869
We want to hear those, don’t we,
ladies and gentlemen?

892
00:41:58.869 --> 00:41:59.869
APPLAUSE.

893
00:41:59.869 --> 00:42:00.911
Come on, Robert.

894
00:42:00.911 --> 00:42:03.077
Cards on the table,
what are your personal views?

895
00:42:03.077 --> 00:42:05.494
Do you feel any discomfort
about Donald Trump and Boris

896
00:42:05.494 --> 00:42:06.536
Johnson being so pally?

897
00:42:06.536 --> 00:42:07.619
Hang on, hang on.

898
00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:10.452
Well, I think apart from the hair
colour, I do not see

899
00:42:10.452 --> 00:42:12.119
that much communality
between a classical scholar...

900
00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:14.536
Are you saying BorisJohnson
and Donald Trump have got

901
00:42:14.536 --> 00:42:17.161
the same hair colour?

902
00:42:17.161 --> 00:42:22.161
I think BorisJohnson might
have a word with you about that.

903
00:42:24.077 --> 00:42:26.952
I do think there are some lazy
comparisons which are not borne

904
00:42:26.952 --> 00:42:27.952
out by the evidence.

905
00:42:27.952 --> 00:42:30.827
What I want to see in
the United States is the Democratic

906
00:42:30.827 --> 00:42:32.994
Party organising its caucuses
efficiently, so that we know

907
00:42:32.994 --> 00:42:35.702
what the results are going to be,
and that the candidate

908
00:42:35.702 --> 00:42:37.702
who they produce will
provide a proper contest,

909
00:42:37.702 --> 00:42:41.786
rather than something that
will be a rollover.

910
00:42:41.786 --> 00:42:44.702
I mean, Trump has confounded
the rules of politics in a way

911
00:42:44.702 --> 00:42:47.327
that perhaps some of us,
I’ll admit I’m quite a conventional

912
00:42:47.327 --> 00:42:49.952
sort of person in the way
that I do my politics,

913
00:42:49.952 --> 00:42:50.994
find difficult and challenging.

914
00:42:50.994 --> 00:42:52.036
But elections are elections.

915
00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:54.244
We have to work with whoever
is democratically elected

916
00:42:54.244 --> 00:42:59.202
in the White House.

917
00:43:01.202 --> 00:43:02.661
You call it a challenging, Robert?

918
00:43:06.286 --> 00:43:08.702
Where do you start with the way
he treats minorities,

919
00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:09.869
treats women, what he’s done.

920
00:43:09.869 --> 00:43:11.786
He nearly caused World
War III with Iran.

921
00:43:11.786 --> 00:43:13.286
That is not difficult
and challenging.

922
00:43:13.286 --> 00:43:16.869
He abused his office of State to be
able to pick on a political rival.

923
00:43:16.869 --> 00:43:18.036
This isn’tjust bad manners.

924
00:43:18.036 --> 00:43:21.411
This is terrible politics,
should be called out as such.

925
00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:26.286
And again, ourforeign policy
was distinct from that

926
00:43:26.286 --> 00:43:29.702
of the Trump White House
in that we do support the nuclear

927
00:43:29.702 --> 00:43:32.536
deal, and have done our best
to try to invoke the dispute

928
00:43:32.536 --> 00:43:33.786
resolution mechanisms,
because we believe,

929
00:43:33.786 --> 00:43:35.911
when we signed treaties,
we believe in due process

930
00:43:35.911 --> 00:43:36.911
of international law.

931
00:43:36.911 --> 00:43:39.786
That is the United Kingdom actually
having a distinct position from that

932
00:43:39.786 --> 00:43:40.869
of the administration...

933
00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:43.952
You rolled out the red carpet
for him to come to this country

934
00:43:43.952 --> 00:43:47.119
because we are weak in the world
right now, rather than strong enough

935
00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:52.077
to stand up and tell him
when he has got things wrong.

936
00:43:52.744 --> 00:43:55.827
And we are all demeaned
by it as a result.

937
00:43:55.827 --> 00:43:58.744
OK, I think this could
go on for some time.

938
00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:01.619
There is another question
I want to get in, if I may,

939
00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:02.702
from Naomi Jamboretz.

940
00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:04.119
Have I pronounced your
surname correctly?

941
00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:06.786
You have, thank you.

942
00:44:06.786 --> 00:44:08.744
Does the panel believe
that I am appropriately

943
00:44:08.744 --> 00:44:10.744
dressed for this occasion?

944
00:44:10.744 --> 00:44:13.411
LAUGHTER

945
00:44:13.411 --> 00:44:14.452
APPLAUSE

946
00:44:14.452 --> 00:44:19.327
Right.

947
00:44:19.327 --> 00:44:21.994
Now, for those of you who are not
sitting around Naomi,

948
00:44:21.994 --> 00:44:23.911
she is wearing an off
the shoulder dress.

949
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:26.286
Which I assume, Naomi,
is a reference to your colleague,

950
00:44:26.286 --> 00:44:29.411
who was wearing an off the shoulder
dress in the House of Commons,

951
00:44:29.411 --> 00:44:31.619
and had quite a response,
not a favourable one,

952
00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:35.911
and social media.

953
00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:40.869
And the papers were
all over it as well.

954
00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:43.077
ﬂ

955
00:44:43.077 --> 00:44:50.952
I presume you think, yes? I think I
would like my daughter to be

956
00:44:50.952 --> 00:44:51.161
I presume you think, yes? I think I
would like my daughter to bejudged

957
00:44:51.161 --> 00:44:51.536
would like my daughter to be judged
on the

958
00:44:51.536 --> 00:44:53.077
would like my daughter to bejudged
on the merits of what she says, and

959
00:44:53.077 --> 00:44:56.411
on the merits of what she says, and
not what she wears. Why are we going

960
00:44:56.411 --> 00:44:56.786
not what she wears. why are we going
there with

961
00:44:56.786 --> 00:44:59.119
not what she wears. Why are we going
there with this? Because we asked

962
00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:00.827
there with this? Because we asked
it. We nearty

963
00:45:00.827 --> 00:45:02.369
there with this? Because we asked
it. We nearly had World War III in

964
00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:03.494
it. We hearty had World War III in
Iran, we have

965
00:45:03.494 --> 00:45:04.327
it. We nearly had World War III in
Iran, we have a climate emergency...

966
00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:07.536
Iran, we have a climate emergency...
You might not like it, but if these

967
00:45:07.536 --> 00:45:09.119
You might not like it, but if these
are the questions the audience asks,

968
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.786
are the questions the audience asks,
that is the purpose of the

969
00:45:10.786 --> 00:45:17.702
that is the purpose of the
programme, let answer it. If it was

970
00:45:17.702 --> 00:45:19.911
programme, let answer it. If it was
Gok Wan challenging her on what she

971
00:45:19.911 --> 00:45:20.077
Gok Wan challanging her on what she
was

972
00:45:20.077 --> 00:45:21.702
Gok Wan challenging her on what she
was wearing, she might be worried

973
00:45:21.702 --> 00:45:23.619
was wearing, she might be worried
about it, but it was Piers Morgan,

974
00:45:23.619 --> 00:45:25.661
about it, but it was Piers Morgan,
come on! Women can’t win, there was

975
00:45:25.661 --> 00:45:29.119
come on! Women can’t win, there was
a shoulder in Parliament, it isn’t a

976
00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:30.786
a shoulder in Partiament, it isn’t a
big deal.

977
00:45:30.786 --> 00:45:31.369
a shoulder in Parliament, it isn’t a
big deal. Stella is absolutely

978
00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:32.536
big deal. Stella is absolutely
right. Aggressive politicians have

979
00:45:32.536 --> 00:45:34.702
right. Aggressive politicians have
to stand up from some of the

980
00:45:34.702 --> 00:45:39.494
to stand up from some of the
nonsense we get from right—wing

981
00:45:39.494 --> 00:45:41.077
nonsense we get from right—wing
commentators. Jo Swinson got more

982
00:45:41.077 --> 00:45:42.244
commentators. Jo Swinson got more
comments about her earrings than

983
00:45:42.244 --> 00:45:44.369
comments about her earrings than
some of thing she was saying. That’s

984
00:45:44.369 --> 00:45:46.202
some of thing she was saying. That’s
outrageous. I think women are held

985
00:45:46.202 --> 00:45:48.411
outrageous. I think women are held
to a different standard from men and

986
00:45:48.411 --> 00:45:49.786
to a different standard from men and
it’s completely wrong. My male

987
00:45:49.786 --> 00:45:51.494
it’s completely wrong. My male
colleague was the first MP to an

988
00:45:51.494 --> 00:45:54.494
colleague was the first MP to an
open necked shirt, without a tie. It

989
00:45:54.494 --> 00:45:57.994
open necked shirt, without a tie. It
didn’t really make a headline. And

990
00:45:57.994 --> 00:45:59.661
didn’t really make a headline. And
that is the way men are treated in

991
00:45:59.661 --> 00:45:59.827
that is the my men are treated in
different

992
00:45:59.827 --> 00:46:00.911
that is the way men are treated in
different ways from women and I

993
00:46:00.911 --> 00:46:06.827
different ways from women and I
think it has got to stop.

994
00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:09.702
There is a serious point here?

995
00:46:09.702 --> 00:46:11.369
There is an absolute
serious point here.

996
00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:14.202
And I think this is what happens
when we put public opinion

997
00:46:14.202 --> 00:46:15.244
and procedure above policy.

998
00:46:15.244 --> 00:46:17.702
And as you said, someone
showed a bit of shoulder

999
00:46:17.702 --> 00:46:19.619
in the House of Commons,
I don’t care.

1000
00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:21.244
Do I agree with what she’s saying?

1001
00:46:21.244 --> 00:46:22.327
Absolutely.

1002
00:46:22.327 --> 00:46:25.411
Is what she’s saying of merit,
and is she a damned good MP

1003
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:26.661
and a woman of character?

1004
00:46:26.661 --> 00:46:29.869
Absolutely.

1005
00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:33.494
By all means, wear what you want,
I have one of those, a size six,

1006
00:46:33.494 --> 00:46:36.786
I’m glad didn’t wear it now,
we would have had the same thing on!

1007
00:46:36.786 --> 00:46:37.827
Yes, the woman there.

1008
00:46:37.827 --> 00:46:41.411
I personally think
it was inappropriate.

1009
00:46:41.411 --> 00:46:43.786
For example, for this evening

1010
00:46:43.786 --> 00:46:46.036
we were all asked
to dress smart—casual.

1011
00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:48.786
Were you?!
I didn’t know that!

1012
00:46:48.786 --> 00:46:51.786
That’s interesting.
Yes, we were. We were.

1013
00:46:51.786 --> 00:46:54.661
So I think there’s a slight
hypocrisy there, and if I’m looking

1014
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:56.786
at the ladies on the panel,
you’ve all got...

1015
00:46:56.786 --> 00:46:59.286
Well, two of you have
gotjackets on,

1016
00:46:59.286 --> 00:47:04.202
and you’ve got a smart dress
which is buttoned up to here.

1017
00:47:04.202 --> 00:47:08.994
Why didn’t you wear anything
like Tracy Brabin?

1018
00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:11.702
I didn’t wear a cold shoulder top
literally for that reason,

1019
00:47:11.702 --> 00:47:14.702
because I get cold shoulders!

1020
00:47:14.702 --> 00:47:17.702
Hang on, in fairness...

1021
00:47:17.702 --> 00:47:21.452
Why aren’t you asking
the men why they chose...?

1022
00:47:21.452 --> 00:47:23.702
Hang on, let mejust make a point.

1023
00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:26.619
Because Tracy Brabin did say
she wasn’t expecting to make

1024
00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:28.994
a comment at the despatch box,
so she was actually

1025
00:47:28.994 --> 00:47:31.161
going out that evening,
so she was slightly taken

1026
00:47:31.161 --> 00:47:33.077
by surprise, but nonetheless
was defending her right

1027
00:47:33.077 --> 00:47:34.286
to wear what she liked.

1028
00:47:34.286 --> 00:47:36.911
But that’s interesting, so you,
as a woman, you’re not supporting

1029
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:39.077
her right to wear
pretty much what she wants.

1030
00:47:39.077 --> 00:47:40.994
Because that is irrelevant
to what she says.

1031
00:47:40.994 --> 00:47:42.911
No, I think it’s important,
what she said,

1032
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:46.369
but I do think that
there’s a certain dress code.

1033
00:47:46.369 --> 00:47:51.411
If she’s leading, she should lead
by example, and I don’t think...

1034
00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:56.036
I don’t think the off
the shoulder was appropriate,

1035
00:47:56.036 --> 00:47:57.952
because it was too much
off the shoulder,

1036
00:47:57.952 --> 00:48:01.369
it looked like a disco outfit
and not like a politician.

1037
00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:03.786
0K, there’s quite a few women
with their hands up,

1038
00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:04.994
so let’s hear some more.

1039
00:48:04.994 --> 00:48:09.619
Yes, the woman in the
glasses at the back.

1040
00:48:09.619 --> 00:48:12.036
Yes, it’s fine for women
to wear what they want,

1041
00:48:12.036 --> 00:48:15.369
but are we now saying
it’s OK to tear up the dress code

1042
00:48:15.369 --> 00:48:18.994
and then, if we do that,
can we blame schoolchildren

1043
00:48:18.994 --> 00:48:21.494
who breach uniform codes?

1044
00:48:21.494 --> 00:48:23.452
You know?

1045
00:48:23.452 --> 00:48:26.119
There’s not a uniform code, though,
in the House of Commons.

1046
00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:29.244
I know, but is there a dress code
in the House of Commons?

1047
00:48:29.244 --> 00:48:33.202
Because if we say people can wear
anything they want to wear anywhere,

1048
00:48:33.202 --> 00:48:36.327
then that means we are tearing up
the dress code anyway and then

1049
00:48:36.327 --> 00:48:38.952
there shouldn’t be a uniform code
as well for the children.

1050
00:48:38.952 --> 00:48:41.369
That means they’re allowed to
flout uniform codes in school,

1051
00:48:41.369 --> 00:48:44.786
if the adults believe they can
actually flout dress codes as well.

1052
00:48:44.786 --> 00:48:47.286
0K, lots of women
with their hands up,

1053
00:48:47.286 --> 00:48:50.119
let me have a quick scout
around the room.

1054
00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:53.327
Yes, the woman there
with the brown hair, yeah. Me?

1055
00:48:53.327 --> 00:48:54.994
Yes, I can’t see
what you’re wearing!

1056
00:48:54.994 --> 00:48:56.702
But I know you’ve got brown hair.

1057
00:48:56.702 --> 00:48:59.619
I think it’s so important to mention
this, because it shows

1058
00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:01.786
an overarching theme of culture
that we have today,

1059
00:49:01.786 --> 00:49:05.327
where sexual harassment
is so normalised.

1060
00:49:05.327 --> 00:49:08.702
I’m 21, and it’s so unusualfor me
to come across someone who hasn’t

1061
00:49:08.702 --> 00:49:11.786
had to deal with some form of sexual
harassment, and I was going

1062
00:49:11.786 --> 00:49:16.786
to mention the Pretty Little Thing
advert that got banned recently.

1063
00:49:18.077 --> 00:49:23.119
Which advert are you referring to?
Pretty Little Thing?

1064
00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:30.452
Oh, it was criticised
for being overly sexualised.

1065
00:49:30.452 --> 00:49:35.494
Yeah, basically, but I watched it,
and a lot of people 18—24,

1066
00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:39.286
which is what it was aimed at,
will be dressing like that,

1067
00:49:39.286 --> 00:49:41.452
especially for things like festivals
and things like that.

1068
00:49:41.452 --> 00:49:44.619
So if people are told
that it’s wrong to dress like that,

1069
00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:46.494
it normalises people
sexual harassing people

1070
00:49:46.494 --> 00:49:49.327
who are dressed like that.

1071
00:49:49.327 --> 00:49:53.869
And it’s really not OK.

1072
00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:56.286
And I think people mentioning...
I can’t remember her name,

1073
00:49:56.286 --> 00:49:58.161
but the politician that
had the shoulder...

1074
00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:03.202
Tracy Brabin.

1075
00:50:03.452 --> 00:50:05.619
Tracy Brabin, that had
the shirt off the shoulder,

1076
00:50:05.619 --> 00:50:07.994
itjust shows an overarching culture
that we have today.

1077
00:50:07.994 --> 00:50:11.411
0K, two women with their hands up,
then I’ll come back to the panel.

1078
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:12.786
The woman in the red top.

1079
00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:14.494
While women are still
underrepresented in politics,

1080
00:50:14.494 --> 00:50:17.827
is it really fair to be focusing
so much on what they are wearing

1081
00:50:17.827 --> 00:50:18.869
over what they’re saying?

1082
00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:22.244
What image is that giving to young
people who want to go into politics,

1083
00:50:22.244 --> 00:50:24.661
that your work is going to be
undervalued based on

1084
00:50:24.661 --> 00:50:25.702
what you’re wearing?

1085
00:50:25.702 --> 00:50:27.619
0K, yes, and the women
just behind you.

1086
00:50:27.619 --> 00:50:28.661
Hi.

1087
00:50:28.661 --> 00:50:31.036
Yes, as the lady further down
said that Tracy’s dress

1088
00:50:31.036 --> 00:50:33.911
looked like a disco outfit,
as a mother of two young girls,

1089
00:50:33.911 --> 00:50:36.786
I very much hope that they will
grow up to express themselves

1090
00:50:36.786 --> 00:50:41.786
as they feel, and actually I make
many trips to the supermarket

1091
00:50:41.786 --> 00:50:43.577
with my daughter dressed
in her tutu,

1092
00:50:43.577 --> 00:50:46.702
with her leopard print onesie,
and that’s absolutely fine,

1093
00:50:46.702 --> 00:50:49.036
because I think, actually,
dress code, yes,

1094
00:50:49.036 --> 00:50:50.911
there has to be
some sort of boundaries,

1095
00:50:50.911 --> 00:50:53.786
but actually people should be able
to express themselves how they wish.

1096
00:50:53.786 --> 00:50:58.827
And it shouldn’t be judged at all.

1097
00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:02.202
You wanted to come in?

1098
00:51:02.202 --> 00:51:04.786
Well, there is actually
a dress code in Parliament,

1099
00:51:04.786 --> 00:51:07.202
but it’s only for men,
because Parliament

1100
00:51:07.202 --> 00:51:09.827
hasn’t thought about the fact
that there might be women there.

1101
00:51:09.827 --> 00:51:13.702
Frankly, Tracy could have
been wearing a wimple

1102
00:51:13.702 --> 00:51:17.119
and someone would still comment
on what you’re wearing.

1103
00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:21.244
I’m sure they would comment
if she was wearing a wimple!

1104
00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:24.369
I promise you, one of the things
that I’m going to do when

1105
00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:26.994
I get back from maternity leave,
and actually what I’m wearing,

1106
00:51:26.994 --> 00:51:30.327
madam, is a shirt so I can
breast—feed, that’s why I’m wearing

1107
00:51:30.327 --> 00:51:33.202
what I’m wearing, is to campaign
to make misogyny a hate crime

1108
00:51:33.202 --> 00:51:36.077
alongside all the other forms
of abuse that women and men get

1109
00:51:36.077 --> 00:51:38.744
so that we treat women equally,
because it’s a thing that’s

1110
00:51:38.744 --> 00:51:40.202
tackled street harassment.

1111
00:51:40.202 --> 00:51:43.327
When half of all young girls in this
country tell us they’re frightened

1112
00:51:43.327 --> 00:51:45.786
to walk our streets,
we have bigger challenges to deal

1113
00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:48.369
with than a bare shoulder
in parliament or the fact that

1114
00:51:48.369 --> 00:51:51.161
Piers Morgan is offended by it.

1115
00:51:51.161 --> 00:51:53.411
APPLAUSE.

1116
00:51:53.411 --> 00:51:58.411
I mean, Rachel, what is interesting,
or what struck me anyway,

1117
00:51:58.827 --> 00:52:02.452
because I’ve asked exclusively women
for a response to this,

1118
00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.369
and not everyone is
of the same mind,

1119
00:52:04.369 --> 00:52:07.286
we’ve got at least two women
here who don’t support the idea

1120
00:52:07.286 --> 00:52:08.911
of Tracy wearing a dress like that.

1121
00:52:08.911 --> 00:52:11.369
Well, that’s allowed, I believe.
I’m just making the point.

1122
00:52:11.369 --> 00:52:13.536
You know, maybe that
will get banned, who knows?

1123
00:52:13.536 --> 00:52:18.494
Give it time!

1124
00:52:19.452 --> 00:52:22.577
But I think what’s interesting,
a woman at the back made that point

1125
00:52:22.577 --> 00:52:23.994
about how difficult,
how underrepresented women

1126
00:52:23.994 --> 00:52:29.036
are in politics as it is,
and I think that’s really important,

1127
00:52:30.536 --> 00:52:35.577
because this is just one more way
ofjudging women and, you know,

1128
00:52:40.661 --> 00:52:45.702
young people looking at this play
out, and the level of criticism

1129
00:52:48.202 --> 00:52:50.661
heaped upon a woman for her dress
choices in parliament

1130
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:52.994
are going to think, you know,
added to the misogyny

1131
00:52:52.994 --> 00:52:55.702
and the harassment and the abuse
that women get, disproportionately,

1132
00:52:55.702 --> 00:52:57.369
and black women most of all,

1133
00:52:57.369 --> 00:52:59.036
would just put them off
getting involved.

1134
00:52:59.036 --> 00:53:03.994
Why on earth would you want
to sign up for that?

1135
00:53:04.869 --> 00:53:07.952
So I think it’s really important
that we don’t focus on these issues

1136
00:53:07.952 --> 00:53:10.369
and do actually talk about policy
and experience and capabilities

1137
00:53:10.369 --> 00:53:15.369
and talent instead.

1138
00:53:23.827 --> 00:53:26.744
0K, since the question was asked,
we’re going to focus on it

1139
00:53:26.744 --> 00:53:27.911
for one more person,
Robert.

1140
00:53:27.911 --> 00:53:31.619
I was in the chamber when Tracy came
in to make a point of order,

1141
00:53:31.619 --> 00:53:34.702
and you know what was remarkable
about it was that she’s got quite

1142
00:53:34.702 --> 00:53:37.244
a nasty issue with her ankle,
and it’s totally bound up

1143
00:53:37.244 --> 00:53:40.411
at the moment, I think she might
have had some surgery on it,

1144
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:43.536
and she hopped to the despatch box
to make a point of order

1145
00:53:43.536 --> 00:53:46.161
because she was determined to come
in and have his say,

1146
00:53:46.161 --> 00:53:48.327
despite the fact, you know,
her mobility was quite

1147
00:53:48.327 --> 00:53:49.369
significa ntly restricted.

1148
00:53:49.369 --> 00:53:52.494
And frankly, I was more interested
in that than what she was wearing.

1149
00:53:52.494 --> 00:53:55.369
She was wearing the equivalent
of black tie, if it was me,

1150
00:53:55.369 --> 00:53:59.202
I might have come in wearing black
tie, if I was going on to a dinner.

1151
00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:01.369
Get over it, move on,
and let’s focus upon

1152
00:54:01.369 --> 00:54:03.786
what politicians of whatever gender,
whatever sex are talking about,

1153
00:54:03.786 --> 00:54:04.786
not what they’re wearing.

1154
00:54:04.786 --> 00:54:05.827
0K.

1155
00:54:05.827 --> 00:54:06.869
APPLAUSE.

1156
00:54:06.869 --> 00:54:09.661
I’m going to get one
more question in.

1157
00:54:09.661 --> 00:54:12.036
We’ve just got time to do it,
and it’s something

1158
00:54:12.036 --> 00:54:14.702
that’s been touched upon already
but there are an awful lot

1159
00:54:14.702 --> 00:54:17.327
of questions about it,
so I wanted to raise it quickly

1160
00:54:17.327 --> 00:54:21.494
in the time we have left,
from Stephanie Russon, Stephanie.

1161
00:54:21.494 --> 00:54:23.827
Should the Prime Minister
speak to all of the press

1162
00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.244
orjust the ones he likes?

1163
00:54:25.244 --> 00:54:26.327
Right.

1164
00:54:26.327 --> 00:54:27.369
0K.

1165
00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:28.411
APPLAUSE.

1166
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:33.452
Rachel?

1167
00:54:38.952 --> 00:54:41.619
Yes, this government is quite
worrying with the press, isn’t it?

1168
00:54:41.619 --> 00:54:43.952
It has a really weird
relationship to the press.

1169
00:54:43.952 --> 00:54:46.827
We saw it pop up in the general
election campaign as well,

1170
00:54:46.827 --> 00:54:51.119
the Government, aside from spreading
a misinformation campaign,

1171
00:54:51.119 --> 00:54:56.119
which is why it is so weird to hear
you talking about trust, Robert,

1172
00:55:03.911 --> 00:55:06.577
besides that, they seem to not
like the BBC’s undue attention

1173
00:55:06.577 --> 00:55:09.702
on things like a toddler
being forced to sleep on the floor

1174
00:55:09.702 --> 00:55:13.577
of a hospital for a lack of beds,
to which I would suggest may be,

1175
00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:16.411
you know, put some money
into the NHS so that you avoid

1176
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:21.452
having toddlers forced
to lie on the ﬂoor.

1177
00:55:22.744 --> 00:55:25.577
This was during
the election campaign.

1178
00:55:25.577 --> 00:55:27.911
Rather than getting upset
when the price does itsjob

1179
00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:32.911
and draws attention to the fact.

1180
00:55:34.161 --> 00:55:36.786
We also have the Government,
I think it has banned ministers,

1181
00:55:36.786 --> 00:55:39.744
is it, from appearing on the Today
programme because, you know, those

1182
00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:40.994
questions aren’t any good either?

1183
00:55:40.994 --> 00:55:43.577
It’s a really worrying trend.

1184
00:55:43.577 --> 00:55:47.161
As Stella was saying before,
you should be feeling uncomfortable,

1185
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:50.369
it’s not supposed to be fun for you.

1186
00:55:50.369 --> 00:55:52.744
It’s actually your job
to be scrutinised by the media,

1187
00:55:52.744 --> 00:55:56.577
and you don’t get to pick and choose
which of the media you want to talk

1188
00:55:56.577 --> 00:56:01.452
to, and you don’t get to play
this stupid performative game

1189
00:56:01.452 --> 00:56:03.619
of antagonising the media
for the sake of spectacle

1190
00:56:03.619 --> 00:56:08.661
and as a way of distracting
from your woeful policies.

1191
00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:13.619
APPLAUSE.

1192
00:56:15.786 --> 00:56:19.161
Well, I just want to say, thank you,
Robert, because you are on this

1193
00:56:19.161 --> 00:56:21.786
programme, thank you for coming
on and taking all the questions

1194
00:56:21.786 --> 00:56:25.411
taking the odd one for me as well.
Do you want to respond to that?

1195
00:56:25.411 --> 00:56:27.786
I mean, obviously, Rachel has talked
about the Today programme,

1196
00:56:27.786 --> 00:56:29.494
have you appeared on
the Today programme?

1197
00:56:29.494 --> 00:56:32.119
I was last on the Today programme
during the election campaign,

1198
00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:33.202
I did several appearances.

1199
00:56:33.202 --> 00:56:35.077
But since then?
No, I haven’t.

1200
00:56:35.077 --> 00:56:38.494
Look, I love the Today programme,
Radio 4 has been my radio channel

1201
00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:41.244
of choice for about 30 years.

1202
00:56:41.244 --> 00:56:43.869
I relish scmtiny,
it’s part of my job as a politician,

1203
00:56:43.869 --> 00:56:46.786
but I do think, you know,
with respect, it’s easy to make

1204
00:56:46.786 --> 00:56:49.411
jibes against a politician whose
views you disagree with and suggest

1205
00:56:49.411 --> 00:56:52.286
that somehow he or she is avoiding
the press, when in fact

1206
00:56:52.286 --> 00:56:54.744
what has happened over the last,
you know, few months

1207
00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:59.702
has been unprecedented scrutiny,

1208
00:56:59.744 --> 00:57:04.702
and scrutiny that continues
in Parliament every week.

1209
00:57:05.536 --> 00:57:07.452
So the Prime Minister comes
and answers questions

1210
00:57:07.452 --> 00:57:08.911
of MP5 of all different colours,

1211
00:57:08.911 --> 00:57:12.202
he and his ministers are exposed
to scrutiny on the floor

1212
00:57:12.202 --> 00:57:17.161
of the House where everybody
can watch and everybody can...

1213
00:57:18.161 --> 00:57:21.202
Let him answer, please.

1214
00:57:21.202 --> 00:57:26.077
Look, the election campaign,
I mean, a lot of us,

1215
00:57:26.077 --> 00:57:29.161
you know, I was in the thick of it
in the election campaign,

1216
00:57:29.161 --> 00:57:30.619
out on the media
answering questions,

1217
00:57:30.619 --> 00:57:32.661
and frankly so was
the Prime Minister.

1218
00:57:32.661 --> 00:57:35.036
He was being interviewed many,
many times across the country

1219
00:57:35.036 --> 00:57:39.994
by national and local
and regional media.

1220
00:57:39.994 --> 00:57:42.327
And he refused to be
questioned by Andrew Neil.

1221
00:57:42.327 --> 00:57:44.911
Oh, well, so what?!

1222
00:57:44.911 --> 00:57:49.244
So what...?! So what?

1223
00:57:49.244 --> 00:57:52.619
So what! Look...

1224
00:57:52.619 --> 00:57:53.827
He ran away from scrutiny.

1225
00:57:53.827 --> 00:57:56.702
I’m sorry, Ijust think,
when you look at the whole picture,

1226
00:57:56.702 --> 00:57:59.369
the idea that somehow BorisJohnson
is someone we don’t know

1227
00:57:59.369 --> 00:58:01.536
much about and don’t
know his views, come on!

1228
00:58:01.536 --> 00:58:03.702
I mean, he’s probably one
of the most scrutinised

1229
00:58:03.702 --> 00:58:04.702
politicians in modern history.

1230
00:58:04.702 --> 00:58:07.077
Is there much that we don’t know
about BorisJohnson?

1231
00:58:07.077 --> 00:58:08.119
I don’t think so!

1232
00:58:08.119 --> 00:58:10.577
And, frankly, you know,
my view is that it’s convenient,

1233
00:58:10.577 --> 00:58:12.744
it’s very convenient,
I think, for people who disagree

1234
00:58:12.744 --> 00:58:16.286
with him to suggest
that he is running away.

1235
00:58:16.286 --> 00:58:18.661
I think the opposite is the case.

1236
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:21.994
It’s just...

1237
00:58:21.994 --> 00:58:25.536
Taking a slightly different tack
here, John Humphrys,

1238
00:58:25.536 --> 00:58:28.786
when he left the Today programme
in September,

1239
00:58:28.786 --> 00:58:31.577
mentioned thatJeremy Corbyn

1240
00:58:31.577 --> 00:58:33.744
hadn’t been on the Today programme
for three years.

1241
00:58:33.744 --> 00:58:36.161
So I’m wondering, is that a sense
of perspective there?

1242
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:39.536
Look no, look, I think part
of ourjob is to be in that

1243
00:58:39.536 --> 00:58:40.786
uncomfortable position
of being scrutinised,

1244
00:58:40.786 --> 00:58:42.911
and I don’t think it’s
just about your leader,

1245
00:58:42.911 --> 00:58:46.494
I think it’s about all of us,
I think we should try and be part

1246
00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:48.827
of a healthy vibrant democracy
when we have those debates.

1247
00:58:48.827 --> 00:58:50.994
The challenge here
is it’s part of a pattern.

1248
00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:53.161
Somebody there just shouted
about the report into Russia,

1249
00:58:53.161 --> 00:58:55.786
you know, this is a government
that is notjust trying

1250
00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:57.744
to restrict the press coming
into Downing Street,

1251
00:58:57.744 --> 00:58:59.952
not publishing important
reports into intelligence

1252
00:58:59.952 --> 00:59:01.619
about whether there had been
Russian interference

1253
00:59:01.619 --> 00:59:03.744
in our democracy
before an election.

1254
00:59:03.744 --> 00:59:04.786
When judges challenge them,

1255
00:59:04.786 --> 00:59:09.536
start to talk about changing
the rules of the Supreme Court.

1256
00:59:09.536 --> 00:59:11.536
A government that then
starts floating the idea

1257
00:59:11.536 --> 00:59:14.369
that we might get rid of
the BBC is a national broadcaster.

1258
00:59:14.369 --> 00:59:16.786
It starts to paint a picture
of somebody who actually

1259
00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:17.827
doesn’t enjoy scrutiny,
Robert.

1260
00:59:17.827 --> 00:59:20.661
You know, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck,

1261
00:59:20.661 --> 00:59:22.827
there is a lot of quacking
going on here,

1262
00:59:22.827 --> 00:59:25.286
but not much actual scrutiny
of what government is doing.

1263
00:59:25.286 --> 00:59:29.369
And for us to be able to do ourjob,
you know, I can sit in Parliament,

1264
00:59:29.369 --> 00:59:32.786
I can ask one question,
but I am just one MP.

1265
00:59:32.786 --> 00:59:36.452
We need a healthy, vibrant press,
we need an independentjudiciary,

1266
00:59:36.452 --> 00:59:38.369
because that independence
is what keeps us honest

1267
00:59:38.369 --> 00:59:41.036
and keeps our democracy free
and healthy for all of us.

1268
00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:43.202
And when that gets threatened
and slowly the strings

1269
00:59:43.202 --> 00:59:45.786
get taken away piece by piece,
which is what BorisJohnson

1270
00:59:45.786 --> 00:59:49.786
is doing, all of us will be
damaged by it as a result.

1271
00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:54.327
And yes, I would hold
the Labour Party up and say, yes,

1272
00:59:54.327 --> 00:59:57.702
we have to be part of that process
too, we have to be accountable,

1273
00:59:57.702 --> 01:00:02.036
but I’m not going to give
BorisJohnson a free pass

1274
01:00:02.036 --> 01:00:04.702
when what he’s doing now is
not going on mainstream media

1275
01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:07.036
but has its own Facebook channel
where he is pretending

1276
01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:11.911
to be like Jennifer Aniston,

1277
01:00:11.911 --> 01:00:13.869
jumping out on people
like she’s on Friends!

1278
01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:14.869
Extraordinary...

1279
01:00:14.869 --> 01:00:18.036
We are almost out of time.
We’ve only got about a minute left.

1280
01:00:18.036 --> 01:00:20.619
I think now more than ever,
politicians need to be held

1281
01:00:20.619 --> 01:00:22.077
accountable
and ask the right questions

1282
01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.327
and give good, solid answers.

1283
01:00:23.327 --> 01:00:27.494
The time for catchphrases
and signposting has been and gone.

1284
01:00:27.494 --> 01:00:31.786
It has happened, we have left,
and so on and so forth.

1285
01:00:31.786 --> 01:00:34.661
And yes, he does duck interviews,
he does get a free pass,

1286
01:00:34.661 --> 01:00:38.744
and if only being interviewed
by the people he likes,

1287
01:00:38.744 --> 01:00:41.494
what does that say?
Anyone can be...

1288
01:00:41.494 --> 01:00:46.286
Even the nastiest people
can be nice to their friends.

1289
01:00:46.286 --> 01:00:48.827
Ed, we’ve only got about
30 seconds left, I’m afraid.

1290
01:00:48.827 --> 01:00:50.786
Hugely serious issue.

1291
01:00:50.786 --> 01:00:53.869
Dominic Cummings, the Prime
Minister’s right hand person,

1292
01:00:53.869 --> 01:00:56.827
called the BBC the mortal enemy
of the Conservative Party.

1293
01:00:56.827 --> 01:01:00.202
We have got to stand up for the BBC
if we do nothing else.

1294
01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:01.869
APPLAUSE.

1295
01:01:01.869 --> 01:01:05.536
All right.

1296
01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:09.119
On that note, our hour is up.

1297
01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:14.077
Thank you very much
for all your questions,

1298
01:01:14.911 --> 01:01:17.327
and I know this issue ofjournalists
came up earlier,

1299
01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:20.744
and a lot of you asked it,
so Ijust wanted to get it

1300
01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.327
in quickly at the end,
I’m sorry I didn’t have time

1301
01:01:23.327 --> 01:01:24.577
for many comments from you.

1302
01:01:24.577 --> 01:01:25.786
But our time is up.

1303
01:01:25.786 --> 01:01:27.161
Next week we are in Dundee,

1304
01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:29.619
and a week after that we
will be in Weymouth.

1305
01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.994
Call if you would like to be
in the audience

1306
01:01:31.994 --> 01:01:33.702
or go to the Question Time website,

1307
01:01:33.702 --> 01:01:35.327
and you can follow
the instructions there.

1308
01:01:35.327 --> 01:01:37.244
If you want to carry on
this discussion,

1309
01:01:37.244 --> 01:01:39.161
you can have your say
on tonight’s topics,

1310
01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:42.077
you canjoin Adrian Giles and guests
on Question Time Extra Time,

1311
01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:43.494
that’s on 5 live right now.

1312
01:01:43.494 --> 01:01:47.077
But itjust remains for me to say
thank you very much to the panel,

1313
01:01:47.077 --> 01:01:49.786
thank you very much to the audience
here for coming along

1314
01:01:49.786 --> 01:01:52.661
and asking so many questions,
and thank you to you at home,

1315
01:01:52.661 --> 01:01:54.327
of course, for watching
and for listening.

1316
01:01:54.327 --> 01:01:55.369
From Harpenden, bye—bye.

1317
01:01:55.369 --> 01:01:58.744
APPLAUSE.

1318
01:02:41.786 --> 01:02:43.119
It’s like Armageddon out there.

1319
01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:45.536
We don’t have enough staff,
we don’t have enough machines,

1320
01:02:45.536 --> 01:02:46.661
we don’t have enough room.

1321
01:02:46.661 --> 01:02:48.744
He’s about half—a—centimetre
away of being dead.
