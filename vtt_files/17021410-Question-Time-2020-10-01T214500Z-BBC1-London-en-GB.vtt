Welcome to the opening night
of Strictly: The Best Of Musicals.

62
00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:51.232
It’s time to razzle dazzle.

63
00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:55.899
It’s like bringing a whole new
world to the Strictly dance floor.

64
00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.607
Sequins, glitter and sparkle.

65
00:01:58.607 --> 00:02:00.190
Strictly: The Best Of Musicals.

66
00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:06.857
It’s undignified to
hold on to the sleeve of someone

67
00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:08.232
who wants to leave.

68
00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:10.440
My bag! It’s on the train!

69
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.524
Do you know where Douglas is now?
No idea.

70
00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:13.649
Doesn’t seem right.

71
00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.440
If you want something that much, you
ought to get it, don’t you think?

72
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.190
Would I be able to borrow some cash?

73
00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:29.440
Of course it’s a worry. I want to
have a family one day, innit, so...

74
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.732
Me and Ben are brothers, both with
problems with our testicles.

75
00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:37.024
Itjust goes to show how common
fertility issues are in men.

76
00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.440
No man should
take his fertility for granted.

Welcome, Helen.

And we have a live audience with us,

via video link.

120
00:04:30.024 --> 00:04:33.815
Tonight, you are all in Carlisle
or in the Carlisle area.

121
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.940
So, hello, good to see you,
very good to have you with us.

122
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.107
Thank you forjoining us.

123
00:04:38.107 --> 00:04:41.190
And, of course, to you at home,
you canjoin in the conversation

124
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.065
as well in the way you know,
on social media at bbcquestiontime.

125
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.482
So let’s hear what you
have to say, as well.

126
00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:48.399
OK, let’s start with our
first question tonight,

127
00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.732
which is from David Ewing.

128
00:04:51.732 --> 00:04:55.857
Good evening, Fiona,
and welcome to Carlisle.

129
00:04:55.857 --> 00:05:00.815
Has the time come for the UK
to adopt the Australian policy

130
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.649
of processing illegal asylum seekers
outside of UK waters?

131
00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:10.815
So, there’s been a bit
of talk about this today.

132
00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:14.649
Plans, blue sky thinking, I’m not
sure what, from the Government.

133
00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.565
We’ll come to you,
Grant, in a moment.

134
00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:20.565
Alison?

135
00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:25.565
I think we’re a bit fed up
of having policies that

136
00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:28.315
are pulled out of a hat
by the Conservative party almost...

137
00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:33.274
You know, some of these ideas that
are being suggested that risk

138
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.315
being really inhumane,
that are being trailed almost

139
00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:38.690
to get people stirred up.

140
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.357
I think we’ve had enough of that
and what we actually

141
00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:46.315
need is a decent policy,
where we treat people

142
00:05:47.357 --> 00:05:49.815
properly who have suffered,
you know, in conflict,

143
00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:53.065
in the worst situations
in the world and we have...

144
00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:55.940
What is it particularly that
you are objecting to in the ideas

145
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.399
that have been mooted?

146
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:04.190
In terms of potentially government
policy regarding asylum seekers?

147
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.274
David’s question, I think,
refers to some of the ideas that

148
00:06:08.274 --> 00:06:11.649
have been trailed in the media,
that then later kind of get

149
00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.982
abandoned, about islands 4000
miles away or offshore,

150
00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:20.315
you know, centres,
to receive people.

151
00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:24.232
Labour did suggest something
similar under Blair,

152
00:06:24.232 --> 00:06:25.649
processing people in
Tanzania, for example?

153
00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.940
Ithink...

154
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.440
Take, for example, what’s happened
with European refugees,

155
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.899
for example in Calais,
where the Home Office could have

156
00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.899
more proactively sent officials,
could have worked harder to get

157
00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.565
people who are pretty vulnerable
dealt with in a proper way

158
00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:47.982
and they consistently
haven’t done so.

159
00:06:47.982 --> 00:06:50.607
There are whole issues around
the underfunding of border force

160
00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:53.024
that I worry risks our security
and that’s happened over

161
00:06:53.024 --> 00:06:54.024
the past ten years.

162
00:06:54.024 --> 00:06:59.024
But what really worries me
about what we’re hearing

163
00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:05.524
in the press all the time is sort
of I almost suspect it’s a bit

164
00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:06.607
of a distraction technique.

165
00:07:06.607 --> 00:07:08.982
You know, the Government’s having
problems so they come up

166
00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:11.607
with another one of these ideas
to get people stirred up.

167
00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:13.274
I don’t think we should do that.

168
00:07:13.274 --> 00:07:15.982
I think they should put forward
a proper set of policies,

169
00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:18.315
we’ll scrutinise them based
on their merits and we should

170
00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:19.774
have an immigration policy that way.

171
00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.690
Ishould mention, David,
you referred to them

172
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.732
as illegal immigration.

173
00:07:22.732 --> 00:07:25.107
If people are claiming asylum,
they are not illegal yet.

174
00:07:25.107 --> 00:07:27.565
It depends on what decision is taken
regarding their status.

175
00:07:27.565 --> 00:07:28.565
Stuart?

176
00:07:28.565 --> 00:07:31.190
Well, listen, this is a very modern
dilemma but, of course,

177
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.357
it isn’t a modern dilemma,
it’s been around for

178
00:07:33.357 --> 00:07:34.440
hundreds of years.

179
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.315
This country has always
been the place that

180
00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:37.524
people want to come to.

181
00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.690
We’ve been accepting people
here on a migratory basis

182
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.607
for hundreds of years,
whether it’s the Huguenots

183
00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:44.482
or the people escaping the pale
of Russia and we’ve always been

184
00:07:44.482 --> 00:07:45.690
a home to these people.

185
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.107
We’ve got a physical problem
because they are coming over.

186
00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:50.774
We’ve got a legal problem
because you can’tjust deport them

187
00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:55.565
and you have got a moral problem
because we have a moral obligation,

188
00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:58.690
I think, in this world, as a very
civilised and very rich country,

189
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.357
to be able to help these people.

190
00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:03.024
On the physical side,
that is not going to go away

191
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:06.107
so we have to think about how
we mitigate the problems and how

192
00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:08.774
we do deter people from coming
here and how we negotiate

193
00:08:08.774 --> 00:08:10.940
with our European colleagues
about perhaps sharing the load

194
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.565
and have better ways of stopping
people make that perilous journey.

195
00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:15.482
On the legal front,
when people are here,

196
00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:17.649
they have certain rights
and we must uphold those

197
00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:18.732
rights and then...

198
00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.857
So what do you think about the idea,
David’s question is about processing

199
00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:24.482
these people not on UK soil?

200
00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:29.482
I don’t know who it was in the House
of Commons today but I very much

201
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.274
agree with what she said,
this is the most bonkers

202
00:08:32.274 --> 00:08:33.315
idea I’ve ever heard.

203
00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:36.190
I think the idea of actually
bringing people in and shipping them

204
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.857
off to St Helena or putting them
on used ships, used

205
00:08:38.857 --> 00:08:41.482
ferries in the North See
or the Irish Sea is preposterous.

206
00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:42.690
I think it is inhumane.

207
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.649
I don’t think it would work.

208
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.982
They’ve got to be fed.

209
00:08:45.982 --> 00:08:48.357
They’ve got to be clothed,
they’ve got to be educated,

210
00:08:48.357 --> 00:08:51.565
they’ve got to be looked after,
how are you going to do that?

211
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:56.565
Is it bonkers, did you think it was
bonkers when you read about this

212
00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:00.024
idea about Ascension?

213
00:09:00.024 --> 00:09:03.107
First of all, the agreement stuff
and we’ve got a long and proud

214
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:05.774
history as a country of people
coming here and seeking refuge,

215
00:09:05.774 --> 00:09:07.190
including my family
some generations ago.

216
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.149
And I think that Britain should be
proud of that but we also have

217
00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:13.774
to accept that we have an issue
with the illegal gangs

218
00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.940
running criminal outfits,
bringing people over across a very,

219
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.357
very dangerous crossing
in tiny boats.

220
00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:22.357
That’s the issue that
needs to be dealt with.

221
00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:26.857
But is sending people to Ascension
island the way of dealing with it?

222
00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:30.024
So any responsible government would,
of course, have a look at how other

223
00:09:30.024 --> 00:09:32.607
countries are dealing with these
things and have dealt with them

224
00:09:32.607 --> 00:09:35.024
successfully and look
at a variety of different ideas.

225
00:09:35.024 --> 00:09:38.440
But I have to say at this stage,
Alison says, I’m sick and tired

226
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.857
of reading things in the newspaper.

227
00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:42.774
Well, you and I both
because you read all sorts of stuff

228
00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:44.899
in the newspaper and usually it’s
not government policy

229
00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:46.107
or anything of the sort.

230
00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:47.524
You’re giving a briefing...

231
00:09:47.524 --> 00:09:50.607
Let’s just...

232
00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:51.774
Grant, just clarify for us.

233
00:09:51.774 --> 00:09:53.857
Hang on, we’ve all read...

234
00:09:53.857 --> 00:09:56.607
People think somehow
this is deliberate.

235
00:09:56.607 --> 00:09:59.024
No, newspapers have to actually
write stuff, they write stuff

236
00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:00.482
and then you have to respond.

237
00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:03.315
But at this point in time,
none of this is a policy.

238
00:10:03.315 --> 00:10:06.899
When it is, of course, someone
will come out and confirm it.

239
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.274
But were these things,
some of these things

240
00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:11.982
actually discussed, then,
the idea of this sort of magic wave

241
00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:14.274
machine that would send the boats
back by creating waves?

242
00:10:14.274 --> 00:10:15.982
That was actually
discussed in a meeting?

243
00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.024
Not to my knowledge.

244
00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:18.232
Or sending people to Moldova?

245
00:10:18.232 --> 00:10:19.315
Look...

246
00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:21.649
I’ve not been to meetings
about those things at all.

247
00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:22.690
Oil rigs?

248
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.774
But you must know.

249
00:10:23.774 --> 00:10:26.149
I’m sure you’ve been briefed before
you came on tonight,

250
00:10:26.149 --> 00:10:27.232
were those things discussed?

251
00:10:27.232 --> 00:10:30.024
I can honestly say I’ve never been
in a meeting about any

252
00:10:30.024 --> 00:10:31.315
of those things at all.

253
00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:34.649
But what is true and what is quite
proper is we have to deal

254
00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:35.732
with the criminal gangs.

255
00:10:35.732 --> 00:10:39.982
It’s a disgusting people trafficking
exploitation that’s going on,

256
00:10:39.982 --> 00:10:42.857
that puts people’s lives at risk
and actually as that humane country

257
00:10:42.857 --> 00:10:45.565
that I described at first,
of course we should look

258
00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:48.399
at if there are better ways we can
help with the situation.

259
00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:51.815
One of the things is not to turn
a blind eye and enable these

260
00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:53.482
gangs to bring very,
very vulnerable people

261
00:10:53.482 --> 00:10:58.440
to our shores, some of whom’s lives
have been put at risk along the way.

262
00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:03.065
So is the Government is serious...

263
00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:06.232
First it was the subject of leak
and then it was confirmed this

264
00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.149
was something the Government
was thinking about, how

265
00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:13.107
to deal with migrants
coming over the Channel.

266
00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:16.940
Is this something we’re likely,
is this a serious proposition

267
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.065
by the Government, off shoring
asylum seekers and processing

268
00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:20.107
them off British soil?

269
00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:22.732
Well, as I say, I can’t comment
on speculation in newspapers

270
00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.065
but I can absolutely...

271
00:11:24.065 --> 00:11:26.232
I’m asking you if that
is a government idea?

272
00:11:26.232 --> 00:11:29.524
I can absolutely confirm
the Government is quite rightly

273
00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:33.899
and properly looking at and thinking
through all the possible different

274
00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:36.274
ways to prevent people from actually
dying in the Channel.

275
00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:37.940
And these gangs trafficking people.

276
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.607
If we weren’t doing that,
you would be asking

277
00:11:42.607 --> 00:11:43.649
on earth we weren’t.

278
00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:44.732
David?

279
00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:45.940
Fiona, this is
absolutely astonishing.

280
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.065
The Secretary of State
for Transport, which last time

281
00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:50.732
I checked include boats,
doesn’t seem to know whether or not

282
00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:53.399
the Government has a plan to put
asylum seekers on boats.

283
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:56.982
One of the things I see in myjob
as the MP for Glasgow East

284
00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:59.190
is a really high asylum case load.

285
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.524
I’ve got to say that the people
who come to these islands to seek

286
00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:05.190
asylum are some of the most
vulnerable people in the world.

287
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.690
People who are fleeing war,
sexual violence, famine, persecution

288
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.107
because of their sexuality
and the way that the British

289
00:12:10.107 --> 00:12:12.274
government treat asylum seekers
within the Home Office system

290
00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:14.732
is absolutely despicable
at the best of times.

291
00:12:14.732 --> 00:12:18.024
And the fact that the UK Government
can’t rule this out right now really

292
00:12:18.024 --> 00:12:22.107
does indicate that they do
want to treat people like some sort

293
00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.274
of cattle prodding or some sort
of penal colony.

294
00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:27.857
What I’d like the Secretary of State
to rule out right now is this idea

295
00:12:27.857 --> 00:12:30.524
that they would use Scottish islands
as some way of processing

296
00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:31.565
asylum seekers.

297
00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:34.149
I don’t know if Grant can take that
opportunity right now

298
00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:36.315
because if he can’t,
that would be deeply alarming.

299
00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:39.024
First of all, I ought to take
the opportunity to correct

300
00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:41.399
something you’ve just said,
which is of course people come

301
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:42.857
here fleeing terrible
persecution and Britain,

302
00:12:42.857 --> 00:12:46.149
as I said and has been commented on,
has a proud reputation of bringing

303
00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:48.565
people in and thousands of people
making new lives here.

304
00:12:48.565 --> 00:12:51.024
But you just described it
as if somebody in France

305
00:12:51.024 --> 00:12:53.649
is being persecuted and, actually,
France is a freedom loving country

306
00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:58.107
as well, where people
are already within the EU.

307
00:12:58.107 --> 00:13:01.024
So I think it’s just very important
to be careful and cautious

308
00:13:01.024 --> 00:13:03.607
with our language here and not try
and present a situation

309
00:13:03.607 --> 00:13:04.649
which is inflammatory.

310
00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:07.315
Well, I find it very difficult
to take lectures about careful

311
00:13:07.315 --> 00:13:09.232
and cautious language
from a government that has

312
00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:13.940
the hostile environment.

313
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.065
Every single day in my constituency
casework, I see some of the most

314
00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:19.232
vulnerable people in the world
being messed about by

315
00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:20.982
the Home Office, left
in substandard accommodation

316
00:13:20.982 --> 00:13:24.024
because the Home Office don’t care
and this is just the latest example

317
00:13:24.024 --> 00:13:25.940
of really irresponsible policy
from the British government,

318
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.607
which has no care whatsoever
for some of the most vulnerable

319
00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:29.774
people coming to this country.

320
00:13:29.774 --> 00:13:31.482
Let me see what our audience think.

321
00:13:31.482 --> 00:13:34.024
David?
You asked the question.

322
00:13:34.024 --> 00:13:36.649
We all want to be a country that
does give protection

323
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.732
to those who need it.

324
00:13:39.732 --> 00:13:43.940
My father’s side of the family
was given refuge in this country

325
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.649
from the Spanish Civil War.

326
00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:47.774
The point is, these people
are coming here illegally

327
00:13:47.774 --> 00:13:49.732
from the safe haven of France.
You know...

328
00:13:49.732 --> 00:13:51.399
They are not all coming
illegally, David.

329
00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:54.524
I’m sorry tojump in but they’re not
all coming in illegally, no.

330
00:13:54.524 --> 00:13:58.774
If it’s a legal application to join
the UK, that’s fine.

331
00:13:58.774 --> 00:14:03.565
But don’t forget, these people
are going through Europe,

332
00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:07.649
they’re going through Spain,
Greece, Italy, France.

333
00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:12.399
Nobody’s yet explained to me
why the camps in France

334
00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.440
are still in position.

335
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.357
I don’t understand that.

336
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:21.065
Why aren’t those asylum applications
being processed in France

337
00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:23.440
or being processed in Greece,
or being processed in Spain?

338
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.524
Or Italy?

339
00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:26.899
I don’t understand that, really,
and it’s been like this

340
00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.274
for quite some time.

341
00:14:30.274 --> 00:14:33.065
And whilst we’re all fighting
the Covid crisis, boats

342
00:14:33.065 --> 00:14:36.107
are still coming to the UK
and it can’t be sustainable,

343
00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:37.649
it’s unsustainable.

344
00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:41.065
Dale?

345
00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:44.565
From my point of view,
the UK already has a plethora

346
00:14:44.565 --> 00:14:46.899
of impending prominent crises.

347
00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:49.649
It’s got Scottish independence,
coronavirus, Brexit and Ijust

348
00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:54.649
believe that the demonisation
of these desperate, vulnerable

349
00:14:56.982 --> 00:14:59.357
people isjust a horrid distraction
from the Conservative government’s

350
00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:00.815
failure on all of those fronts.

351
00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:01.857
Helen?

352
00:15:01.857 --> 00:15:03.190
Thank you.

353
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.149
As a front line clinician,
I see some of the most vulnerable

354
00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:07.857
people in our society,
including people who

355
00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:12.899
are here as refugees.

356
00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:16.024
And the vast majority of them
need our support and our compassion

357
00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:18.440
and as a civilised human being,
I feel deeply uncomfortable

358
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.857
about the thinly veiled racism
that is often wrapped up

359
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:21.899
in these dialogues.

360
00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:24.315
So we are a civilised nation,
as others have said,

361
00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:26.649
let’s behave in a civilised manner
to the most vulnerable

362
00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:27.357
people around us.

363
00:15:27.357 --> 00:15:29.774
people around us.

364
00:15:30.232 --> 00:15:32.440
0K, there’s a number
of questions being put tonight

365
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.899
so we’re going to move on.

366
00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:37.482
Before I do, Ijust want to tell
you that we are looking for people

367
00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:40.357
to join our virtual audience,
sadly virtual but it’s what we have

368
00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.565
to do in these times.

369
00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:43.732
Just like the people
we have here from Carlisle,

370
00:15:43.732 --> 00:15:47.065
next week we will be in Coventry
and the week after that we are

371
00:15:47.065 --> 00:15:48.232
going to be in Edinburgh.

372
00:15:48.232 --> 00:15:50.690
So if you live in either
of those two cities

373
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.065
or thereabouts, do get in touch.

374
00:15:52.065 --> 00:15:55.024
Go to the Question Time website,
you can fill in the form

375
00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:57.899
there and think of a question
or an issue that you’re burning

376
00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:01.024
to ask and let’s see if we can get
you on the programme.

377
00:16:01.024 --> 00:16:02.940
It would be great to hear from you.

378
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.815
Right, let’s take our next question
now which is from Charlotte Tollman.

379
00:16:05.815 --> 00:16:06.815
Hello.

380
00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:09.232
So my question is, recently,
thousands of students have returned

381
00:16:09.232 --> 00:16:10.690
to or have just started university.

382
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.565
But for students in Glasgow,
the virus has spread so quickly that

383
00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:15.732
new students have been forced
to isolate in their

384
00:16:15.732 --> 00:16:16.774
unfamiliar halls.

385
00:16:16.774 --> 00:16:20.107
We’ve been lied to about the quality
of teaching, and Ifeel I’ve been

386
00:16:20.107 --> 00:16:22.524
coaxed back to university away
from the safety of my

387
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.440
home in Cumbria, whilst
still paying full price.

388
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.315
There has been no regard
for my mental health and the only

389
00:16:27.315 --> 00:16:30.440
concern that I feel has been is me
being part of the profit.

390
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.857
The money issue is bad enough
issue but what action

391
00:16:32.857 --> 00:16:37.607
is the Government taking to protect
students’ mental health?

392
00:16:37.607 --> 00:16:39.315
Charlotte’s at a
Scottish university.

393
00:16:39.315 --> 00:16:40.482
David?

394
00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:43.732
Yeah, I really feel for Charlotte.

395
00:16:43.732 --> 00:16:46.649
I mean, obviously I have lots
of students in my own constituency

396
00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:47.815
who have gone back to university
and I think...

397
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.274
So what can you do to help?

398
00:16:51.274 --> 00:16:53.940
The first thing that we doing,
for example, is to try

399
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.982
and increase testing.

400
00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:57.857
So we’ve now put in a walk
in testing Centre in Glasgow

401
00:16:57.857 --> 00:16:59.274
and in St Andrews as well.

402
00:16:59.274 --> 00:17:01.940
We are acknowledging this is not
the fault of young people.

403
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.565
Going to university is an incredibly
exciting thing for young people

404
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.982
and it’s a very difficult time
for them, as well.

405
00:17:06.982 --> 00:17:09.607
But they can’t walk in if their
self—isolating, as thousands are.

406
00:17:09.607 --> 00:17:12.024
At the moment, there’s
lots of guidance that’s being worked

407
00:17:12.024 --> 00:17:14.190
up with the National Union
of Students, which has

408
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.190
certainly been welcomed.

409
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.607
We’ve given quite a lot of guidance
to the accommodation

410
00:17:17.607 --> 00:17:18.649
providers as well.

411
00:17:18.649 --> 00:17:21.024
It’s about understanding that
for students this is a very,

412
00:17:21.024 --> 00:17:23.190
very difficult time and we are doing
absolutely everything

413
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.649
we can to support them,
in conjunction with the NUS.

414
00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:27.024
And I do feel for Charlotte.

415
00:17:27.024 --> 00:17:29.940
Hopefully we’ll try and get
through this as best as we can

416
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.024
and will looking to try and get
in a situation where students can

417
00:17:33.024 --> 00:17:34.107
return at Christmas.

418
00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:36.982
But the situation in Glasgow
is there’s no doubt it’s a perilous

419
00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:38.440
situation it’s about
protecting people’s safety,

420
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440
first their physical safety

421
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.607
but also their mental health
of students, as well.

422
00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:44.774
It’s a very, very vulnerable time
for them and my heart goes out

423
00:17:44.774 --> 00:17:47.149
to them and we’ll do our best
to support them.

424
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.149
Helen?

425
00:17:48.149 --> 00:17:50.565
Look, my student days were some
of the most exciting

426
00:17:50.565 --> 00:17:52.690
and rewarding of my life.

427
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.524
Are you, like everyone else,
feel the students who are in this

428
00:17:55.524 --> 00:17:57.440
situation, but the period
of lockdown that is

429
00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.482
being proposed is short.

430
00:17:58.482 --> 00:18:00.899
It’s a couple of weeks,
and then a greater degree

431
00:18:00.899 --> 00:18:01.940
of normality will return.

432
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.607
But of course all of life
is profoundly affected and Covid

433
00:18:04.607 --> 00:18:06.982
isn’t going to be passed
in a matter of weeks.

434
00:18:06.982 --> 00:18:08.649
We are here for the long haul.

435
00:18:08.649 --> 00:18:11.774
We are into a second wave and,
indeed, a third and fourth wave

436
00:18:11.774 --> 00:18:15.107
will come and we need to be prepared
for that and we cannot suspend

437
00:18:15.107 --> 00:18:16.357
education for all that time.

438
00:18:16.357 --> 00:18:18.024
I’m affiliated to the
University of Birmingham.

439
00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:20.440
I know the huge efforts that
lecturers have been putting

440
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.274
in to prepare to do as much
and a high quality online

441
00:18:23.274 --> 00:18:24.982
as possible, because nobody
wants this situation.

442
00:18:24.982 --> 00:18:26.024
That Helen, Charlotte’s point...

443
00:18:26.024 --> 00:18:27.940
I’m sorry to interrupt,
Charlotte’s point is critically

444
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.315
about the mental health of students
as much as anything.

445
00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:32.774
0h, absolutely, and we need
to ensure students are mentored,

446
00:18:32.774 --> 00:18:34.690
supported, they have great
communication and that basic

447
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.857
necessities are provided for them.

448
00:18:36.857 --> 00:18:40.107
They can’t be the victims in this,
that’s really not helpful

449
00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:43.357
because it’s not students felt that
they’re in this situation.

450
00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:46.399
There’s an awful lot of blame
going on in some places, as well,

451
00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:47.899
and I’m horrified to hear that.

452
00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:49.774
I’ve seen worse behaviour
in older adults than

453
00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:52.232
I have an youngsters, by large.

454
00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.149
What would Labour do
differently when it comes

455
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:57.274
to Charlotte’s point
and I

456
00:18:57.274 --> 00:19:00.107
can see you’ve got your hand up,
so I’m going to come

457
00:19:00.107 --> 00:19:01.607
back to you in a moment.

458
00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.024
When it comes to helping students,

459
00:19:03.024 --> 00:19:04.065
particularly in regard to

460
00:19:04.065 --> 00:19:06.065
their mental health,
students who are isolating

461
00:19:06.065 --> 00:19:10.190
on their own in halls,
many of them for the first time.

462
00:19:13.107 --> 00:19:14.774
So there’s two things
for me, firstly

463
00:19:14.774 --> 00:19:17.982
the testing system and the tracing
system, crucially, tracing people

464
00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:20.732
who have got the virus,
so they can isolate properly.

465
00:19:20.732 --> 00:19:25.690
Making that system works
underpins get a better

466
00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:29.190
scenario almost for every aspect
of our life and that goes

467
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.815
for students as well,
wherever they are.

468
00:19:32.815 --> 00:19:34.774
Because if we can
have a proper system,

469
00:19:34.774 --> 00:19:36.940
where people know that
they can have a test

470
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.649
and get the results back
in a

471
00:19:38.649 --> 00:19:43.315
speedy way, that will help us
across every aspect of our life.

472
00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.690
I have had constituents
have a test and not get

473
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.649
the results back for
five to seven days.

474
00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:52.649
That is not acceptable
and it’s got to change.

475
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.274
Obviously, the office
of students and other bodies

476
00:19:57.274 --> 00:20:00.357
are listening to what students
are saying and I know they want to

477
00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:04.607
encourage universities to be very
responsive to the needs of students

478
00:20:04.607 --> 00:20:09.565
and you know whilst we’ve all seen
on social media the examples where

479
00:20:15.357 --> 00:20:17.774
that’s not been the case,
universities have got to be

480
00:20:17.774 --> 00:20:19.024
responsive to their students needs

481
00:20:19.024 --> 00:20:22.107
and the best ones I’m sure
there are lots of people in higher

482
00:20:22.107 --> 00:20:24.024
education who would absolutely agree
what I’ve said.

483
00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:26.940
One final point that Charlotte said
that is very important is about

484
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.940
students and mental health.

485
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.315
And we know that as
a country we have let

486
00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:34.190
young people down in terms
of their mental health

487
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:39.232
for too long and you know,
as a Labour Party, we have

488
00:20:39.274 --> 00:20:42.357
scrutinised the Government on this
for years now and I think that this

489
00:20:42.357 --> 00:20:44.815
crisis has shown that
failure in sharp relief.

490
00:20:44.815 --> 00:20:49.024
So whilst from opposition
it’s early days for us,

491
00:20:49.024 --> 00:20:54.024
at the moment, but I know that
priority of having the principle of

492
00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:02.440
that’s got to improve

493
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.607
will be part of how we listen
to what

494
00:21:04.607 --> 00:21:07.690
students are going through new and
try to put policies in place that

495
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.774
will help them.

496
00:21:08.774 --> 00:21:10.940
Since you have mentioned
mental health and I hope

497
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.232
you don’t mind me referring to this,
you have put your own mental health

498
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:17.149
out in the public domain and I
wondered if you wanted to

499
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:18.190
share that?

500
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.315
Well, I mean, you know as the shadow
ministerfor sport, I think

501
00:21:21.315 --> 00:21:23.982
that sport is incredible for mental
health, for a really important

502
00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:27.732
reason which is that physical
activity we know had a positive

503
00:21:27.732 --> 00:21:30.857
impact on people’s mental health,
but when you’re doing sport, you get

504
00:21:30.857 --> 00:21:35.190
the joy of being part of a team
as well and I know, I am sure

505
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.149
Charlotte and lots of other students
will be

506
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:43.274
missing some of that, and I think
once we’re able to get to more

507
00:21:43.274 --> 00:21:47.399
normal times, I certainly have
found, in my own feelings ofjust

508
00:21:47.399 --> 00:21:49.024
sort of unhappiness
and particularly around

509
00:21:49.024 --> 00:21:54.024
body shape and ho image
that

510
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.315
body shape and body image that

511
00:21:57.315 --> 00:22:00.440
being part of a sports team and big
shout out to the Westminster

512
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.857
football team and the Wirral
football team and their brilliant

513
00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:06.524
coaching, Ijust know how brilliant
sport has been for my mental health.

514
00:22:06.524 --> 00:22:09.315
Is it something that’s
helped you in particular?

515
00:22:09.315 --> 00:22:12.315
I’ve really surprised this week
about how you know I wrote

516
00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:15.190
this article for Grazia magazine
about it and how many people have

517
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.399
said, do you know what?

518
00:22:16.399 --> 00:22:18.565
Ifeel the same,
I have never had much

519
00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:22.815
confidence about my body shape
and actually sport has helped me.

520
00:22:22.815 --> 00:22:24.982
It turns out I thought
I was alone in

521
00:22:24.982 --> 00:22:25.982
this and I wasn’t.

522
00:22:25.982 --> 00:22:29.315
So it’s been a good
thing in that regard.

523
00:22:29.315 --> 00:22:31.024
There’s been a comment
from our audience.

524
00:22:31.024 --> 00:22:34.774
Charlotte, you wanted
to come back in?

525
00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:38.274
Ijust wanted to go back to
the first point in terms of people

526
00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:42.649
saying that we only have to isolate
for two weeks and it’s not that big

527
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:46.732
a deal in terms of our education,
but it’s notjust if we get

528
00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:50.732
coronavirus or are exposed to it,
it is the fact that we can’t join

529
00:22:50.732 --> 00:22:52.440
sports teams if somebody gets Covid
in

530
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.607
training, or can’tjoin
sports teams in general.

531
00:22:56.607 --> 00:23:00.774
Our whole life has gone on line
and I can’t mix outside my

532
00:23:00.774 --> 00:23:04.982
household, because I’m
above the border.

533
00:23:04.982 --> 00:23:07.607
This affects every aspect
of university life and I think to

534
00:23:07.607 --> 00:23:11.899
minimise it down to
those two weeks is...

535
00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:14.524
Quite almost patronising to us
and there’s been no clear guidance

536
00:23:14.524 --> 00:23:18.107
and that is what we would like
tonight from you guys is when is the

537
00:23:18.107 --> 00:23:20.399
next step coming.

538
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.524
I willjust go around the audience
a bit more if I may.

539
00:23:23.524 --> 00:23:24.607
Gemma?

540
00:23:24.607 --> 00:23:29.565
Good evening.

541
00:23:29.607 --> 00:23:32.482
As a nurse in Cumbria
and as a mum, I think the

542
00:23:32.482 --> 00:23:34.399
mental health of young
people is of paramount

543
00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:37.440
importance at the moment.

544
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.357
But all I keep seeing is our
Government talk about practical

545
00:23:42.857 --> 00:23:45.440
solutions and ploughing money
into this that and the other and

546
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.690
isolating people further.

547
00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.857
But there actually
doesn’t seem to be any

548
00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:53.482
clear strategy in this day and age
to support young people’s

549
00:23:53.482 --> 00:23:54.649
mental health.

550
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:58.024
I mean, young people,
especially as Charlotte said, at

551
00:23:58.024 --> 00:24:01.565
university, they’re isolated
from theirfamily, theirfriends,

552
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:03.024
they’re in new situations,
but the

553
00:24:03.024 --> 00:24:04.690
Government never appears
to touch on mental

554
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:08.274
health and as we know
in the

555
00:24:08.274 --> 00:24:13.274
whole of the UK mental health
provisions for young people are very

556
00:24:13.565 --> 00:24:16.940
poor and you know are we going
the see an increase in the suicide

557
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.607
rate in young people,
because of the

558
00:24:18.607 --> 00:24:20.190
Covid outbreak.

559
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.774
Catherine?

560
00:24:22.774 --> 00:24:27.732
Hi there, Ijust wanted
to agree with what

561
00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:31.107
Charlotte said and actually pick up
on a point where there is a degree

562
00:24:31.107 --> 00:24:33.024
of cynicism I feel,
I have two children

563
00:24:33.024 --> 00:24:34.190
in the north-east, one
of

564
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.107
whom is an 18—year—old
fresher, who has gone

565
00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:38.107
to university expecting
a

566
00:24:38.107 --> 00:24:42.024
very different life to the one
he has in Cumbria and actually has

567
00:24:42.024 --> 00:24:44.899
found himself in halls of residence
in an eight—bedded flat by himself,

568
00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:46.690
because everybody else
hasn’t turned up yet.

569
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.232
And they’re not entirely
sure when they will.

570
00:24:50.232 --> 00:24:53.357
Soto minimise students’
experiences and say well,

571
00:24:53.357 --> 00:24:56.774
it’s only a couple of weeks, they’ll
be able to cope, they have got

572
00:24:56.774 --> 00:24:58.399
social networks, well
actually some of these

573
00:24:58.399 --> 00:24:59.607
children haven’t at
the

574
00:24:59.607 --> 00:25:03.857
moment and they’re away from home
for the first time and I am

575
00:25:03.857 --> 00:25:08.190
concerned that actually even though
he has a sibling in the same city,

576
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.274
at the moment with their lockdown
they’re not meant to spend time with

577
00:25:11.274 --> 00:25:13.399
each other, because they’re
in different households.

578
00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:15.649
50 actually this isn’t
just a temporary, it is

579
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:18.982
young people they’ll
be OK in a few weeks.

580
00:25:18.982 --> 00:25:23.190
I think we could see really
long—term impacts on children who

581
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.232
are going away for the first time in
different environments and different

582
00:25:26.232 --> 00:25:29.649
cities where they don’t know people
and we haven’t really from the

583
00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:32.482
university perspective put in that
kind of support that I would have

584
00:25:32.482 --> 00:25:34.690
expected as a parent,
let alone as a mental

585
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.065
health practitioner.

586
00:25:36.065 --> 00:25:41.065
June, I think you take
a rather different view?

587
00:25:55.357 --> 00:25:58.690
What I was saying was that this
could be the new normal and we

588
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.024
all, whether we are students or not,
have to get our heads around this

589
00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:03.440
situation and learn to adapt really.

590
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.065
I’m not belittling it, I have got
three children, thankfully they’re

591
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.232
the other side of the later 205,
so they have been through this

592
00:26:09.232 --> 00:26:11.690
period and I just think as long
as you have

593
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.524
got a decent computer and I think
that is something the universities

594
00:26:14.524 --> 00:26:16.940
could ensure and don’t assume
everybody that goes to university

595
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.857
has a decent computer,
but without a decent

596
00:26:18.857 --> 00:26:20.274
computer that you ran jump
on

597
00:26:20.274 --> 00:26:23.149
and off 2A hours a day,
as it suits you, you’re sort

598
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:25.149
of dead in the water.

599
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:28.232
But as long as the tutors, you know,
really work hard to get

600
00:26:28.232 --> 00:26:30.899
everything online and make sure
everybody’s on board that needs to

601
00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:32.815
be on board, I think
this could work.

602
00:26:32.815 --> 00:26:37.857
It is such a sad time
for young people as students.

603
00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:37.940
0K.

604
00:26:39.774 --> 00:26:41.232
You know.

605
00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:45.024
No thank for your point.

606
00:26:45.024 --> 00:26:47.774
Stuart?

607
00:26:52.024 --> 00:26:54.024
Charlotte’s original point
was important about the mental

608
00:26:55.357 --> 00:26:56.399
health of nation.

609
00:26:56.399 --> 00:26:59.024
But it is notjust about
the mental health of the

610
00:26:59.024 --> 00:27:00.024
nation.

611
00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:02.982
It is about the physical health
of those people who are not

612
00:27:02.982 --> 00:27:06.024
Covid sufferers, who are not able
to get into hospitals at the moment.

613
00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:08.982
Jeremy Hunt made the point yesterday
that there are 10 million people

614
00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:11.357
waiting for appointments in
hospitals and they’re not able to

615
00:27:11.357 --> 00:27:12.357
go there.

616
00:27:12.357 --> 00:27:14.774
It’s the health of our children
in schools and universities

617
00:27:14.774 --> 00:27:16.440
who are not getting
a proper education.

618
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.607
It is the health, dare I say it,
of business and what I

619
00:27:19.607 --> 00:27:22.690
really worry about now is the cure
that we are currently putting our

620
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.607
country through actually worse
than the disease and do we not have

621
00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:28.982
to come to a time where we now think
this is livelihoods versus lives.

622
00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:32.274
And I don’t think we have had that
debate properly and I think we’re

623
00:27:32.274 --> 00:27:35.440
going to find, as we come
into the autumn, we have a further

624
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.482
lockdown or potentially more

625
00:27:36.482 --> 00:27:39.065
lockdowns, we come to the spring,
we have unemployment coming through,

626
00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:42.940
dare I say it, we’ve got the hill,
whether it’s a good hill or a bad

627
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.982
hill about Brexit.

628
00:27:43.982 --> 00:27:46.399
The time in the spring it
could be very difficult.

629
00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:48.565
And if we just keep
locking people up and

630
00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:49.982
don’t come to terms
with the

631
00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:51.649
fact this illness is not going away.

632
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:54.024
So do you think should happen
in terms of universities?

633
00:27:54.024 --> 00:27:56.232
I think we should actually
be more relaxed, we

634
00:27:56.232 --> 00:27:59.357
should learn to live with the virus,
40,000 people have died, but let’s

635
00:27:59.357 --> 00:28:01.274
ask the question and
Helen is the expert,

636
00:28:01.274 --> 00:28:02.482
how many peopla, Helan,
in

637
00:28:02.482 --> 00:28:07.274
the UK have died
exclusively of Covid?

638
00:28:10.565 --> 00:28:13.649
Well, I mean we know that measures
we said it is about 43,000

639
00:28:13.649 --> 00:28:14.732
have died of Covid.

640
00:28:14.732 --> 00:28:16.649
We suspect there’s another
10,15,000 on top,

641
00:28:16.649 --> 00:28:17.690
that’s the excess deaths.

642
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.899
But people are dying
all the time of lots of

643
00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:24.024
diseases and we do know that there
are implications of the lockdown on

644
00:28:24.024 --> 00:28:25.024
other health behaviours.

645
00:28:25.024 --> 00:28:27.190
And we know there are
people out there who

646
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.607
haven’t come forward
with their cancers and I do worry

647
00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:30.649
about the cancer gap.

648
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:33.274
And there is something really
serious to say, if you have

649
00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:35.190
worrying symptoms, you’ve
got a lump, you’ve got

650
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.857
a strange bleeding problem,
please come forward.

651
00:28:36.857 --> 00:28:39.774
The NHS is open for you,
it has been open and it

652
00:28:39.774 --> 00:28:40.940
continues to be open
for

653
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.274
you, despite Covid.

654
00:28:42.274 --> 00:28:44.982
I think there is some serious
things that we do need

655
00:28:44.982 --> 00:28:47.607
to get better in terms
of our messaging to the public.

656
00:28:47.607 --> 00:28:50.482
That’s my point, the
unintended consequence of

657
00:28:59.732 --> 00:29:01.357
That’s my point, the
unintended consequence of

658
00:29:01.357 --> 00:29:04.274
what we’re doing for this specific
illness may have much bigger knock

659
00:29:04.274 --> 00:29:07.649
on effects that we haven’t even
thought about it and we need to be

660
00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:08.690
thoughtful about it.

661
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.732
James?

662
00:29:09.732 --> 00:29:10.774
Hi there.

663
00:29:10.774 --> 00:29:12.940
Yeah, I can’t of don’t understand
the student situation,

664
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.065
because my daughter started
reception class this year, which

665
00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:16.065
was great.

666
00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:18.774
But she brings home 27 households
into my house every day.

667
00:29:18.774 --> 00:29:20.940
So you know the younger
age group are meant

668
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.440
to be asymptomatic,
or

669
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.024
carry the virus, but don’t have
symptoms, but I think the comment

670
00:29:28.024 --> 00:29:31.857
just made there, we do need to learn
to live with this virus now and all

671
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:34.732
our children at school and every
day my daughter brings home 27

672
00:29:34.732 --> 00:29:35.732
households into my house.

673
00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:37.190
And there’s no control over that.

674
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.982
And if you think of
all the children that

675
00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:42.607
are in school, secondary schools,
primary schools, you know there’s no

676
00:29:42.607 --> 00:29:45.274
control over this virus any more.

677
00:29:45.274 --> 00:29:47.690
We just do not know
who has it and who

678
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.357
is bringing it into each
other’s household.

679
00:29:49.357 --> 00:29:53.357
Gordon?

680
00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:55.232
With the situation
in universities are we

681
00:29:55.232 --> 00:30:00.232
simplyjust kicking
the can down the road?

682
00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:05.024
I feel we shouldn’t lockdown special
age groups of people that

683
00:30:05.024 --> 00:30:10.024
tend not to suffer too
badly with the disease.

684
00:30:11.274 --> 00:30:13.690
I know anybody suffering
with it is terrible, but I

685
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.774
think we are just kicking the can
further down the road.

686
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:22.732
Grant, Charlotte said,
we have been lied to

687
00:30:24.024 --> 00:30:27.315
about the quality of teaching,
I feel I have been coaxed back to

688
00:30:27.315 --> 00:30:30.149
university, away from the safety
of my home in Cumbria, paying full

689
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:32.065
price, with no regard
for my mental health,

690
00:30:32.065 --> 00:30:36.899
the only concern being profit.

691
00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:39.524
Has she got a point there
that the universities and the

692
00:30:39.524 --> 00:30:42.149
Government have not been straight
with students about what it was

693
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:43.190
going to be like?

694
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.774
First of all, I feel
hugely for Charlotte.

695
00:30:47.065 --> 00:30:49.024
We can’t expect young
people just to put

696
00:30:49.024 --> 00:30:50.232
their lives completely on hold.

697
00:30:50.232 --> 00:30:52.774
We have to try to get
the universities

698
00:30:52.774 --> 00:30:55.690
up and running again, education
running again and that is by and

699
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.399
large working.

700
00:30:57.399 --> 00:31:00.607
But Charlotte’s points have
been big questions of

701
00:31:00.607 --> 00:31:05.607
debate in my household this week,
because my eldest has just got back

702
00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:10.232
to university last week and one of,
he lives in a house of four, and one

703
00:31:10.232 --> 00:31:12.899
of the others has tested positive,
so they’re all under self—isolation

704
00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:15.565
and going through that sort
of you know point in time

705
00:31:15.565 --> 00:31:17.940
where we have come here,
we have started to study,

706
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.065
we are now having to do
that through computers,

707
00:31:20.065 --> 00:31:23.482
but in a different city.

708
00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:27.732
In terms of Charlotte’s question,
when she says she has been coaxed

709
00:31:27.732 --> 00:31:31.649
back without any regard
for her mental health and we have

710
00:31:31.649 --> 00:31:33.774
heard many students say we weren’t
told it

711
00:31:33.774 --> 00:31:36.607
would be like this.

712
00:31:36.607 --> 00:31:39.024
We thought we’d get some
online learning, but you

713
00:31:39.024 --> 00:31:43.399
would get learning face to face
and they’re not getting that.

714
00:31:43.399 --> 00:31:45.607
It is because of the
circumstances and no

715
00:31:45.607 --> 00:31:50.607
one’s got a sort of
magic solution to this.

716
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.024
We have got to be up front
and honest about it.

717
00:31:54.024 --> 00:31:56.232
Coronavirus is something
that we are going to have

718
00:31:56.232 --> 00:31:58.565
to live with.

719
00:31:58.565 --> 00:32:01.190
I hear what Stuart says
and others, but the reality is

720
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.899
that although it probably won’t kill
most younger people, it can

721
00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:05.774
certainly carry and spread
it and eventually it

722
00:32:05.774 --> 00:32:06.857
hurts older people.

723
00:32:06.857 --> 00:32:09.024
That’s exactly what we’re
seeing in the figures now

724
00:32:09.024 --> 00:32:10.024
in hospital, in admissions.

725
00:32:10.024 --> 00:32:12.649
The 300 and odd people
who are on ventilators tonight, the

726
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:15.024
2,500 people who are in
hospital with coronavirus.

727
00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:17.607
It will spread.

728
00:32:17.607 --> 00:32:20.524
So we do have to keep taking those
measures but, you know,

729
00:32:20.524 --> 00:32:22.940
as Charlotte and others pointed out,
we can’tjust put

730
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.232
lives on hold forever.

731
00:32:25.232 --> 00:32:29.024
So we have to try and make this work
as the new normal for the time

732
00:32:29.024 --> 00:32:31.482
being and it does mean
that there will be probably

733
00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:33.440
a combination of remote
learning in situations,

734
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.857
but there are lots of university
cases, if you’re training

735
00:32:35.857 --> 00:32:40.232
to be, I don’t know...

736
00:32:40.232 --> 00:32:43.482
Physical things, where you have
to have a degree of with lecturer

737
00:32:43.482 --> 00:32:45.690
time because it can
be something that...

738
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.232
Medicine, for example,
where you have to be there.

739
00:32:49.232 --> 00:32:52.149
So, no, look, I don’t think people
were sort of coaxed back.

740
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:57.107
Universities are autonomous
organisations, but I think it

741
00:32:57.857 --> 00:33:00.940
would be wrong to ask or expect
students not to return to study

742
00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.065
and not to try to get universities
back and I would challenge anyone

743
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:05.774
who says that we
shouldn’t be trying.

744
00:33:05.774 --> 00:33:07.940
Charlotte’s point was maybe
the universities were not quite

745
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.607
as open about what it might
have been like.

746
00:33:10.607 --> 00:33:12.607
Let me just put a question to David.

747
00:33:12.607 --> 00:33:17.607
Nicola Sturgeon, I was listening
to Nicole Sturgeon yesterday,

748
00:33:17.815 --> 00:33:19.982
would not commit herself to students
at Scottish universities

749
00:33:19.982 --> 00:33:24.149
going home for Christmas.

750
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:29.190
So is there still a chance that
students like Charlotte,

751
00:33:29.232 --> 00:33:31.399
she comes from Carlisle
but she is at university

752
00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:34.024
in Scotland, may not be able
to go home for Christmas,

753
00:33:34.024 --> 00:33:35.232
is that still the case?

754
00:33:35.232 --> 00:33:38.107
We are certainly very hopeful that
students can get back for Christmas

755
00:33:38.107 --> 00:33:40.482
and if we ran make that happen,
we will, but...

756
00:33:40.482 --> 00:33:43.149
But you are not committing to it,
maybe they can isolate

757
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:45.024
for two weeks beforehand,
it’s still a possibility

758
00:33:45.024 --> 00:33:47.232
they may have to stay
in university for Christmas?

759
00:33:47.232 --> 00:33:49.649
We are in a situation,
Fiona, where in Glasgow,

760
00:33:49.649 --> 00:33:51.607
hundreds of students have tested
positive the coronavirus.

761
00:33:51.607 --> 00:33:54.899
These are young people who are using
shops in the West End of Glasgow,

762
00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:56.399
potentially mixing around
with other people.

763
00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:59.774
The most important thing at this
stage for us is to try and contain

764
00:33:59.774 --> 00:34:01.940
this virus and that’s why,
on a short—term basis,

765
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.065
we’ve put those lockdown
procedures in place.

766
00:34:04.065 --> 00:34:06.940
I get that but staying at Christmas,
staying at university at Christmas

767
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.399
is still on the table, potentially?

768
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:11.024
We are very hopeful that people can
get home for Christmas.

769
00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:13.149
Christmas is a long
way off at the moment.

770
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:15.607
The most important thing
is controlling this virus and any

771
00:34:15.607 --> 00:34:18.232
politician worth their salt
will have that as a number one

772
00:34:18.232 --> 00:34:19.274
priority at the moment.

773
00:34:19.274 --> 00:34:20.982
Let’s take another question,
from Jonathan Donald.

774
00:34:20.982 --> 00:34:25.399
Hi.

775
00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:28.940
Have the localised lockdowns
and restrictions been totally

776
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.899
ineffective in slowing the spread
of the virus and has the inability

777
00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:39.024
of the UK Government to communicate
the messages effectively

778
00:34:39.024 --> 00:34:41.440
contributed to some extent
to noncompliance amongst certain

779
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.649
individuals within society?

780
00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:46.399
Well, Jonathan’s directing
his question initially

781
00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:49.024
to the UK Government,
so, Grant, I’m going to ask you.

782
00:34:49.024 --> 00:34:51.190
There’s also some talk now,
as I understand it,

783
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.065
about simplifying the message
with a traffic light

784
00:34:53.065 --> 00:34:55.357
system, is that true?

785
00:34:55.357 --> 00:34:58.024
Well, first of all, no,
I don’t think it’s been ineffective,

786
00:34:58.024 --> 00:35:00.857
to answer your question directly.

787
00:35:00.857 --> 00:35:03.190
Looking at examples, like Luton,
for example, or Leicester,

788
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.024
where the numbers were very high.

789
00:35:07.024 --> 00:35:10.065
Local lockdowns, which aren’t
the full lockdowns we all knew

790
00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:14.107
at the beginning of this,
were put in place and we saw

791
00:35:14.107 --> 00:35:17.232
the numbers come down and, actually,
come down to now what are levels

792
00:35:17.232 --> 00:35:19.565
which mean they can come
out of that process.

793
00:35:19.565 --> 00:35:21.982
So, I think it’s helped a lot.

794
00:35:21.982 --> 00:35:24.607
It may also be the case,
and the Chief Medical Officer,

795
00:35:24.607 --> 00:35:27.524
Chris Whitty, has been saying this,
that by having lockdowns in specific

796
00:35:27.524 --> 00:35:32.399
areas, as we did in Luton
and Leicester and now

797
00:35:32.399 --> 00:35:35.024
in the north—west and parts
of the north—east, we are preventing

798
00:35:35.024 --> 00:35:37.940
the spread, preventing the whole
country from having to go into full

799
00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.857
lockdown and then able
to unlock those areas.

800
00:35:39.857 --> 00:35:43.565
So that’s the hope.

801
00:35:43.565 --> 00:35:48.565
Simplification, you’ll have to wait
for, and I understand the point but,

802
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:50.357
actually, wherever
you are in the country,

803
00:35:50.357 --> 00:35:52.982
if you hear that your area
is in a lockdown area,

804
00:35:52.982 --> 00:35:55.899
it’s very quick and very easy
and we just demonstrated it before

805
00:35:55.899 --> 00:35:58.774
coming on the programme,
to go to gov.uk and you can simply

806
00:35:58.774 --> 00:36:01.649
look up where you live and see
exactly what the rules are.

807
00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:04.274
So, they are easy to follow,
you can look them up.

808
00:36:04.274 --> 00:36:07.024
I think it’s very important...

809
00:36:07.024 --> 00:36:09.690
It can’t be that easy to follow
if the Prime Minister

810
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.690
got them wrong himself.

811
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.774
Well, everyone mis—spea ks.

812
00:36:11.774 --> 00:36:14.149
No, sure, I’m not trying
to make a cheap point,

813
00:36:14.149 --> 00:36:17.524
I’m simply saying it can’t be that
easy to understand if even the man

814
00:36:17.524 --> 00:36:18.982
in charge can’t get it right.

815
00:36:18.982 --> 00:36:22.315
He was talking about the rule of six
because that is generally the rule

816
00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.357
throughout the country.

817
00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:26.232
But it is true, in an area that
has a local lockdown,

818
00:36:26.232 --> 00:36:27.899
additional rules will apply,
which generally mean

819
00:36:27.899 --> 00:36:30.315
you can’t mix with other
people in your own home,

820
00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:33.190
in your garden, in
restaurants and pubs.

821
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.357
But you should check
the rules on gov.uk locally.

822
00:36:35.357 --> 00:36:39.232
But to answer the question,
yes, we do believe that

823
00:36:39.232 --> 00:36:41.649
from an epidemiological point
of view, it is doing something

824
00:36:41.649 --> 00:36:43.815
and therefore worth pursuing,
and it has stopped us,

825
00:36:43.815 --> 00:36:46.190
thus far, from having
to go into a second full

826
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.690
lockdown, which is surely
an everybody’s interests.

827
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.690
And, David, in terms
of communicating messages

828
00:36:55.482 --> 00:37:00.399
effectively and noncompliance
among some individuals,

829
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.690
what’s this issue with the SNP?

830
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.357
Well, it’s an MP who is
no longer an SNP Whip

831
00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.524
and for very good reason.

832
00:37:07.524 --> 00:37:09.940
I’ve got to say I’m pretty
furious with the behaviour

833
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.024
of Margaret Ferrier...

834
00:37:11.024 --> 00:37:13.607
Do you just want to explain
to viewers who might not

835
00:37:13.607 --> 00:37:14.649
know what she’s done?

836
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:15.690
U nfortu nately, yes.

837
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.024
One of my former colleagues had
tested positive for coronavirus

838
00:37:18.024 --> 00:37:20.940
and used a train over the course
of this week, quite rightly,

839
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.940
she’s lost the whip.

840
00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.065
So, just to be clear,
she suspected she had

841
00:37:24.065 --> 00:37:25.315
symptoms and took a test.

842
00:37:25.315 --> 00:37:27.732
While she was waiting
for the results, she went down

843
00:37:27.732 --> 00:37:29.649
to Westminster to debate coronavirus
regulations, having broken

844
00:37:29.649 --> 00:37:31.815
them herself and then
when she did test positive,

845
00:37:31.815 --> 00:37:33.732
she went on the train
back to Scotland?

846
00:37:33.732 --> 00:37:36.315
Yes, and it’s utterly inexcusable
and it’s right that she’s lost

847
00:37:36.315 --> 00:37:37.565
the whip for that because...

848
00:37:37.565 --> 00:37:39.024
Do you think she should resign?

849
00:37:39.024 --> 00:37:40.940
She herself called for
Dominic Cummings to resign.

850
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.315
She’s lost the whip,
do you think she should resign?

851
00:37:43.315 --> 00:37:45.732
I certainly think her position
is untenable, to be honest.

852
00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:49.024
So you think she should resign?

853
00:37:49.024 --> 00:37:51.607
You’re asking people to follow very,
very strict public health guidance,

854
00:37:51.607 --> 00:37:54.524
and if a member of Parliament can’t
do that, then they’ve got

855
00:37:54.524 --> 00:37:55.690
to reflect upon the position.

856
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:58.857
So let me hear it from you then,
you think her position’s untenable,

857
00:37:58.857 --> 00:38:00.274
do you think she should resign?

858
00:38:00.274 --> 00:38:03.149
I find it very difficult to say
to my constituents who lives

859
00:38:03.149 --> 00:38:05.065
in the neighbouring constituency
to Rutherglen and Hamilton

860
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:07.940
that her actions were excusable
and so I think she does have

861
00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.149
to reflect on her position.

862
00:38:09.149 --> 00:38:10.565
You think she should resign?

863
00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:13.149
I don’t think her position
is tenable and she should resign.

864
00:38:13.149 --> 00:38:16.024
Gordon, you are nodding
your head along to that?

865
00:38:16.024 --> 00:38:21.065
Yeah, I think if she definitely
called for Dominic’s resignation,

866
00:38:23.399 --> 00:38:26.232
I do think he should have resigned,
then I do think her

867
00:38:26.232 --> 00:38:27.482
job is untenable.

868
00:38:27.482 --> 00:38:30.565
We can’t expect the population
of the country to follow

869
00:38:30.565 --> 00:38:34.940
the guidelines, even if they’re not
quite sure what they are,

870
00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.274
when the people in charge,
who make policy, who appear

871
00:38:39.274 --> 00:38:44.232
on the media, simply defy belief
and even though she knew she had

872
00:38:44.482 --> 00:38:47.774
the virus and she had a positive
test, she actually got on a train.

873
00:38:47.774 --> 00:38:52.815
I can’t believe it.

874
00:38:54.315 --> 00:38:55.399
Stupid.

875
00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.440
Gary?

876
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.607
Just on a lighter note,
I’m starting to wonder

877
00:38:58.607 --> 00:39:00.774
with all the confusion around Covid
rules and regulations

878
00:39:00.774 --> 00:39:02.982
whether we need a Friday
night because to replace

879
00:39:02.982 --> 00:39:05.315
Have I Got News For You
hosted by BorisJohnson?

880
00:39:05.315 --> 00:39:06.315
LAUGHTER.

881
00:39:06.315 --> 00:39:09.482
Of course, he used to host
Have I Got News For You quite

882
00:39:09.482 --> 00:39:10.524
some time ago now.

883
00:39:10.524 --> 00:39:11.565
Yeah, exactly.

884
00:39:11.565 --> 00:39:14.274
I mean, Stuart, Jonathan’s question
is about have localised lockdowns

885
00:39:14.274 --> 00:39:16.190
and restrictions been ineffective
in controlling the spread

886
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.065
of the virus and has
the inability of the Government,

887
00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:21.440
in his view, the UK Government,
to communicate the message

888
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.065
effectively contributed
to noncompliance?

889
00:39:25.065 --> 00:39:28.024
What’s interesting is that
when you look at polls,

890
00:39:28.024 --> 00:39:32.774
the most recent poll looking
at confidence, clarity

891
00:39:32.774 --> 00:39:35.149
from the UK Government
about the clarity of their message,

892
00:39:35.149 --> 00:39:39.107
confidence in that is very low.

893
00:39:39.107 --> 00:39:41.024
When it comes to the Scottish
Government, confidence

894
00:39:41.024 --> 00:39:42.982
about that particular thing,
in terms of clarity

895
00:39:42.982 --> 00:39:44.399
and communication,
is generally pretty high.

896
00:39:44.399 --> 00:39:47.024
But nonetheless, on both sides
of the border, we see lockdowns

897
00:39:47.024 --> 00:39:48.065
and infections rising.

898
00:39:48.065 --> 00:39:52.482
So, I’m wondering, does it
make any difference?

899
00:39:52.482 --> 00:39:54.149
Well, my personal
view is it doesn’t.

900
00:39:54.149 --> 00:39:56.857
If you’re asking me the question.

901
00:39:56.857 --> 00:40:01.857
What I find quite comical is,
listen, this is a very serious

902
00:40:04.149 --> 00:40:07.482
illness that we are facing but it
isn’t the end of life on Earth.

903
00:40:07.482 --> 00:40:10.857
We are going to have to live
with it, as the Chancellor has said,

904
00:40:10.857 --> 00:40:12.065
as Grant has just said.

905
00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:14.690
The second thing is that it’s
incomprehensible that in a country

906
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.065
with 50—60 million people we’ve
actually got four different rules.

907
00:40:17.065 --> 00:40:21.149
So I can go to a pub in London
tonight and I have to leave by 10pm.

908
00:40:21.149 --> 00:40:24.065
But I can go to Belfast
and I can stay until 10:30.

909
00:40:24.065 --> 00:40:26.940
I can be with some friends
in London, six, but I can’t

910
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.982
do that in Scotland.

911
00:40:27.982 --> 00:40:29.399
Why can’t we have uniform rules?

912
00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:33.024
Across the UK, which would make it
much simpler for everybody?

913
00:40:33.024 --> 00:40:36.107
But the real issue for me is one
I tried to raise before,

914
00:40:36.107 --> 00:40:38.815
is I’m not remotely poking a stick
at our audience here,

915
00:40:38.815 --> 00:40:41.149
but I’m quite interested
that we are sitting here talking

916
00:40:41.149 --> 00:40:42.190
about lockdown, lockdown, lockdown.

917
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:47.232
Charlotte’s question
about mental health.

918
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.357
Nobody is talking about
the UK plc’s health.

919
00:40:50.357 --> 00:40:51.399
We did last week.

920
00:40:51.399 --> 00:40:54.524
We may not be talking about it right
now at this minute, Stuart,

921
00:40:54.524 --> 00:40:55.982
and I’m sorry you weren’t there.

922
00:40:55.982 --> 00:40:58.857
You may be weren’t watching but we
absolutely did talk about that.

923
00:40:58.857 --> 00:41:01.732
All our futures and livelihoods
depend on us getting back to some

924
00:41:01.732 --> 00:41:03.899
sort of normality and living
with this crisis and

925
00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:04.982
that the real issue.

926
00:41:04.982 --> 00:41:09.940
But the health of the workforce
is an important input to that.

927
00:41:11.315 --> 00:41:14.232
I mean, Ijust disagree with
what you said before about there’s

928
00:41:14.232 --> 00:41:15.232
lives versus livelihoods.

929
00:41:15.232 --> 00:41:17.649
That’s not right, it’s not one
thing versus the other

930
00:41:17.649 --> 00:41:20.274
because if you haven’t got a healthy
workforce, then the economy

931
00:41:20.274 --> 00:41:21.315
will not be successful.

932
00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:23.232
50, actually, being able
to isolate the virus

933
00:41:23.232 --> 00:41:25.690
is the most important thing,
notjust the people’s health,

934
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.857
absolutely crucial though that is,
that is absolutely vital

935
00:41:27.857 --> 00:41:32.524
for our economy.

936
00:41:32.524 --> 00:41:35.649
But as we know, it was pointed out
by one of our participants

937
00:41:35.649 --> 00:41:38.399
this evening, we can’t
actually put the...

938
00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:41.815
All you do, as the gentleman said,
is kick the can down the street.

939
00:41:41.815 --> 00:41:44.982
You can suppress it here, it pops up
there, it’s like a balloon.

940
00:41:44.982 --> 00:41:48.315
And you can help businesses be more
and more Covid safe.

941
00:41:48.315 --> 00:41:50.982
That’s what lots of businesses
are doing quite successfully...

942
00:41:50.982 --> 00:41:52.024
Alison, you’re quite right.

943
00:41:52.024 --> 00:41:55.982
Give us testing at the door of every
business once a week.

944
00:41:55.982 --> 00:41:59.315
Give us a test and trace system that
works, so people can have security.

945
00:41:59.315 --> 00:42:02.232
Give us the security — Grant Shapps
is the Minister of Transport...

946
00:42:02.232 --> 00:42:03.899
Are you listening, Grant,
are you listening?

947
00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:06.315
When we can get on the
tube and it’s safe.

948
00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:08.940
I’ve been on the tube on London
every single day this

949
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.982
week, nobody’s using it.

950
00:42:09.982 --> 00:42:12.482
It’s got to be fine.

951
00:42:12.482 --> 00:42:13.732
Buses are not being used.

952
00:42:13.732 --> 00:42:17.565
The road system is completely
clogged up because we’ve told people

953
00:42:17.565 --> 00:42:20.732
wherever possible don’t share a car,
go on your own, except you can’t

954
00:42:20.732 --> 00:42:22.857
travel anywhere because the roads
are alljammed up.

955
00:42:22.857 --> 00:42:26.232
It’s nonsense that we have to be
able to find a way through this

956
00:42:26.232 --> 00:42:27.274
problem but I understand...

957
00:42:27.274 --> 00:42:29.440
Stuart, that’s exactly what we’re
doing with these local

958
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.565
lockdowns, which you are also
against which is curious

959
00:42:31.565 --> 00:42:34.190
because if you look at the rate
across the country it’s...

960
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.607
I don’t know, 13 cases
per 100,000 in the south—west.

961
00:42:36.607 --> 00:42:38.274
But it’s over 100 in other places.

962
00:42:38.274 --> 00:42:39.482
It’s a nonsense to say...

963
00:42:39.482 --> 00:42:41.649
If you want to apply
the same rules everywhere,

964
00:42:41.649 --> 00:42:45.024
we will end up in a position
where none of us can do anything.

965
00:42:45.024 --> 00:42:47.649
What we are trying to do,
and I think arguably successfully

966
00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:50.524
now, is get the economy moving,
which it is, but still protect

967
00:42:50.524 --> 00:42:51.607
people’s lives, as well.

968
00:42:51.607 --> 00:42:53.524
The economy’s not moving.

969
00:42:53.524 --> 00:42:55.940
We have to carry on doing
that until the cavalry

970
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.274
of a scientific solution to this,
a vaccine or whatever,

971
00:42:58.274 --> 00:43:02.774
comes over the horizon.

972
00:43:02.774 --> 00:43:04.940
Until then, we have to do
what actually works.

973
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.274
We know these local lockdowns,
to return to the question,

974
00:43:07.274 --> 00:43:09.565
actually do bring the rates down.

975
00:43:09.565 --> 00:43:12.899
Now, Stuart, I’m sorry to interrupt
but you want to talk about UK plc.

976
00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:15.065
We talked about it last
week and there’s lots

977
00:43:15.065 --> 00:43:16.232
of people in our audience...

978
00:43:16.232 --> 00:43:17.274
I will shut up.

979
00:43:17.274 --> 00:43:19.982
No, because I know they want
to talk about it tonight.

980
00:43:19.982 --> 00:43:21.649
So, let’s hear from some of them.

981
00:43:21.649 --> 00:43:25.190
Victoria, you have your hand up, I’m
going to come to you in a second.

982
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.607
Let’s hearfrom James Hill,
and after that, John Miller.

983
00:43:27.607 --> 00:43:28.690
Hi.

984
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.232
Yeah, the whole mixed
messages thing.

985
00:43:32.232 --> 00:43:35.024
I mean, when you have scientific
advisors that are coming out

986
00:43:35.024 --> 00:43:36.690
with comments like "Hospital
admissions are steady"

987
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.149
but "On a rapid incline".

988
00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:39.857
Well, which one is it?

989
00:43:39.857 --> 00:43:44.815
Is it steady or is it rapid?

990
00:43:47.149 --> 00:43:50.024
And these people are advising
the Government and then we get mixed

991
00:43:50.024 --> 00:43:52.440
messages from the Government
at the moment that are saying

992
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.857
what we should and shouldn’t do.

993
00:43:53.857 --> 00:43:56.232
I had full faith in
the scientific side of things,

994
00:43:56.232 --> 00:43:59.607
up until the beginning of this week,
when they came out and started using

995
00:43:59.607 --> 00:44:03.024
all this terminology and coming out
with comments like that.

996
00:44:03.024 --> 00:44:06.565
The public don’tjust know to go
left or right with a lot of these

997
00:44:06.565 --> 00:44:07.607
restrictions and rules.

998
00:44:07.607 --> 00:44:09.274
James, you have a
restaurant, haven’t you?

999
00:44:09.274 --> 00:44:10.315
I’ve got two restaurants.

1000
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.399
You have two restaurants,
forgive me.

1001
00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:13.982
Not one but two.

1002
00:44:13.982 --> 00:44:16.399
Now, how is the pandemic
affecting you at the moment?

1003
00:44:16.399 --> 00:44:18.565
Obviously, I assume business
is down but in terms

1004
00:44:18.565 --> 00:44:21.607
of bookings for the future,
Christmas, say?

1005
00:44:21.607 --> 00:44:24.399
We just don’t know
what to do for December.

1006
00:44:24.399 --> 00:44:26.565
We don’t know if we
should keep our staff.

1007
00:44:26.565 --> 00:44:28.399
We’ve got...

1008
00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:32.024
Normally at this time of year,
I have two thirds of my Christmas

1009
00:44:32.024 --> 00:44:34.899
bookings in, I have large companies
who use one of my restaurants.

1010
00:44:34.899 --> 00:44:36.315
They have their Christmas
parties there.

1011
00:44:36.315 --> 00:44:41.274
I have no Christmas bookings at all
right now and it’s a worrying,

1012
00:44:42.857 --> 00:44:44.024
daunting experience,
going into this

1013
00:44:44.024 --> 00:44:47.440
period for our trade.

1014
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.274
Ijust don’t understand how
the newJob Support Scheme is meant

1015
00:44:50.274 --> 00:44:53.649
to help our trade at the moment.

1016
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:56.440
We have no guidance on the next
three months at all,

1017
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.857
of what our trade should do,
what we should advise our customers.

1018
00:44:59.857 --> 00:45:02.524
Do we get Christmas party
menus out, do we not get

1019
00:45:02.524 --> 00:45:04.024
Christmas party menus out?

1020
00:45:04.024 --> 00:45:06.190
And there is just no
guidance whatsoever for our

1021
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:07.190
trade at the moment.

1022
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.315
I’m not saying the Government
hadn’t done wonders so far

1023
00:45:10.315 --> 00:45:12.940
with the economy, with the packages
we’ve had, the furlough scheme

1024
00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.649
for staff, the grants
we’ve had, brilliant.

1025
00:45:14.649 --> 00:45:15.649
I can’t deny that.

1026
00:45:15.649 --> 00:45:18.315
But moving forward now,
we’ve got six months ahead of us

1027
00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:21.190
where we are going to lose so much
of the hospitality trade

1028
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.524
because of uncertainty.

1029
00:45:23.524 --> 00:45:25.024
John?

1030
00:45:25.024 --> 00:45:30.024
Well, I agree with James.

1031
00:45:30.024 --> 00:45:33.857
I have a hotel as well as
a restaurant and in the hotel,

1032
00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:38.357
we caterfor weddings
and wedding guests.

1033
00:45:38.357 --> 00:45:42.607
Now just last week,
we were allowed 30 wedding

1034
00:45:42.607 --> 00:45:46.024
guests and overnight,
it was so funny, I listened to Grant

1035
00:45:46.024 --> 00:45:48.440
there and he said everything should
be taken locally and

1036
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.774
individually, yeah?

1037
00:45:50.774 --> 00:45:53.649
And all of a sudden,
they put a blanket and said no

1038
00:45:53.649 --> 00:45:56.232
weddings are only 15.

1039
00:45:56.232 --> 00:46:01.274
I can do the same in my restaurant
that can take 120 people,

1040
00:46:01.732 --> 00:46:06.024
Covid safe, with two metres apart,
yet he will not look at anything

1041
00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:10.649
at all that is ideal for individual
restaurants at all.

1042
00:46:10.649 --> 00:46:15.607
Theyjust put a blanket
ban and I don’t know...

1043
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.940
I was actually out
on the Saturday night.

1044
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.024
I kicked everybody out at ten
o’clock and they had a street party.

1045
00:46:24.024 --> 00:46:28.149
They had a street party outside?

1046
00:46:28.149 --> 00:46:29.649
Yeah, they had a street party.

1047
00:46:29.649 --> 00:46:32.024
They all gathered outside
and they had a street party,

1048
00:46:32.024 --> 00:46:37.024
to take the beer home and went
somewhere, like a party outside

1049
00:46:39.982 --> 00:46:41.899
or to people’s houses,
yet they’ve been already

1050
00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:46.899
in a Covid safe environment.

1051
00:46:48.482 --> 00:46:53.440
This is what the ten
o’clock rule does.

1052
00:46:56.065 --> 00:47:01.024
Victoria...

1053
00:47:01.024 --> 00:47:03.690
We are a tourism business,
we have already lost our Christmas.

1054
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:04.899
So what is your business?

1055
00:47:04.899 --> 00:47:07.274
We are a tea room, gift
shop, informs centre for

1056
00:47:07.274 --> 00:47:08.982
Hadrian’s Well, we rely
heavily on visitors.

1057
00:47:08.982 --> 00:47:10.399
We have obviously had no visitors.

1058
00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:12.815
Our Christmas, our version
of Christmas is from April through

1059
00:47:12.815 --> 00:47:16.107
to, well, obviously basically
you knowJune, July, August.

1060
00:47:16.107 --> 00:47:18.732
We have already lost our business.

1061
00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:23.149
Our profit for the entire year.

1062
00:47:23.149 --> 00:47:25.065
And we have had to
temporarily close until

1063
00:47:25.065 --> 00:47:28.565
March next year.

1064
00:47:28.565 --> 00:47:30.482
I really don’t think that
anybody understands what

1065
00:47:30.482 --> 00:47:33.732
it’s like to lose your business.

1066
00:47:33.732 --> 00:47:35.690
And the impact.

1067
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:38.524
And I don’t really think that any
of the politicians get it.

1068
00:47:38.524 --> 00:47:40.065
They have never run anything.

1069
00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:41.524
They don’t understand it.

1070
00:47:41.524 --> 00:47:45.565
They’re all being paid.

1071
00:47:45.565 --> 00:47:47.982
They’re sitting you know
receiving their pay every month, but

1072
00:47:47.982 --> 00:47:51.315
they don’t know what it’s like to be
in a stressful environment and you

1073
00:47:51.315 --> 00:47:54.857
know I’m not alone.

1074
00:47:54.857 --> 00:47:59.899
There is three million
people who haven’t had any

1075
00:48:10.107 --> 00:48:12.274
support, we have had
a little bit of support.

1076
00:48:12.274 --> 00:48:14.440
But we seem to be left high and dry.

1077
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.315
What do you do when you don’t have
any revenue coming in,

1078
00:48:17.315 --> 00:48:19.690
how do you pay, how do
you sustain your business?

1079
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.357
And yet we are just classed
by the Government as not

1080
00:48:22.357 --> 00:48:23.399
viable.

1081
00:48:23.399 --> 00:48:24.440
But we are viable.

1082
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.357
We had a successful
business for ten years.

1083
00:48:26.357 --> 00:48:29.482
And only through Covid have we had
no visitors and therefore you know

1084
00:48:29.482 --> 00:48:32.565
no revenue and we
arejust cast aside.

1085
00:48:32.565 --> 00:48:35.107
As James was saying, we can lose
Christmas, what is anybody

1086
00:48:35.107 --> 00:48:36.815
going to do about that?

1087
00:48:36.815 --> 00:48:38.315
Does anybody really care?

1088
00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:41.357
Are we expendable?

1089
00:48:41.357 --> 00:48:46.357
We are the backbone of the country —
small businesses.

1090
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.065
And we are described
as being the backbone of

1091
00:48:50.065 --> 00:48:52.857
the country.

1092
00:48:52.857 --> 00:48:55.940
But we are just going to be
left new high and dry.

1093
00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.024
All right.

1094
00:48:58.024 --> 00:49:00.774
I have had to close.

1095
00:49:00.774 --> 00:49:02.899
You know my staff,
I have had to make

1096
00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:03.982
redundant.

1097
00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:05.940
This has devastated me personally.

1098
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.065
And yet everybody’s just sitting
here thinking about you

1099
00:49:08.065 --> 00:49:11.815
know, what?

1100
00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:13.357
They’ll just move on.

1101
00:49:13.357 --> 00:49:15.649
But how can we move on?

1102
00:49:15.649 --> 00:49:18.357
What can we do?

1103
00:49:18.357 --> 00:49:22.232
What is anybody going
to do to help us.

1104
00:49:22.232 --> 00:49:26.065
I should point out, a number
of politicians have and do

1105
00:49:26.065 --> 00:49:31.065
run businesses, I know Grant
has been one of them.

1106
00:49:35.732 --> 00:49:38.857
Helen, I know I have got
to come to you, I want to

1107
00:49:38.857 --> 00:49:42.482
come to Chris, you had your hand up.

1108
00:49:42.482 --> 00:49:45.357
If people did what they were being
asked to do, it would

1109
00:49:45.357 --> 00:49:46.440
solve the problem.

1110
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440
End of.

1111
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.899
We wouldn’t have
increasing numbers of

1112
00:49:48.899 --> 00:49:50.690
people going down with the disease.

1113
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:51.732
People are not isolating.

1114
00:49:51.732 --> 00:49:56.274
They’re not social distancing.

1115
00:49:56.274 --> 00:49:58.440
As was evidenced when
John let them out of

1116
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:03.232
his her that night.

1117
00:50:03.232 --> 00:50:04.440
So you know, take responsibility.

1118
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.524
Follow the rules.

1119
00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:08.107
And let’s at least give
them a chance to work.

1120
00:50:08.107 --> 00:50:13.149
Helen you have been trying to get
into the conversation.

1121
00:50:14.774 --> 00:50:16.899
I would certainly like to
echo that last point.

1122
00:50:16.899 --> 00:50:18.815
The science here is actually
quite straight forward.

1123
00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:21.357
Now we understand coronavirus,
it is behaving very predictably.

1124
00:50:21.357 --> 00:50:25.232
Viruses do what viruses
do and spread from

1125
00:50:25.232 --> 00:50:26.690
person—to—person and
the best metaphor I

1126
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.899
can think of.

1127
00:50:27.899 --> 00:50:31.024
Think of a bottle of pop
that’s been shaken.

1128
00:50:31.024 --> 00:50:33.149
You start to unscrew
the top, it comes out.

1129
00:50:33.149 --> 00:50:35.024
You have to put the top back on.

1130
00:50:35.024 --> 00:50:37.899
And if you’re going
to live with this

1131
00:50:37.899 --> 00:50:40.774
pressurised system, you’ve
to release a little bit at a time if

1132
00:50:40.774 --> 00:50:42.190
you’re going to deal with it.

1133
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.607
Then you can deal with
it as it bubbles out.

1134
00:50:44.607 --> 00:50:48.357
That is where local lockdowns
and following the hands, face

1135
00:50:48.357 --> 00:50:51.649
distance and space, test,
trace and isolate have to come out.

1136
00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:55.024
But you can’t miss out
any of those steps.

1137
00:50:55.024 --> 00:50:59.524
Every single one of us has
a responsibility here and now.

1138
00:50:59.524 --> 00:51:01.940
And it is absolutely
right that we need our

1139
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.774
economy working, we need people
working, work is good for health and

1140
00:51:04.774 --> 00:51:06.107
health is good for work.

1141
00:51:06.107 --> 00:51:07.940
These things go hand in hand.

1142
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:12.065
So we can’t think
of them in isolation.

1143
00:51:12.065 --> 00:51:15.065
So we need clarity of messaging,
consistency of messaging and I get

1144
00:51:15.065 --> 00:51:16.482
intensely frustrated
that Hadrian’s Wall

1145
00:51:16.482 --> 00:51:18.107
and Off-1’s Dyke are seen
as

1146
00:51:18.107 --> 00:51:20.024
some sort of barrier
to viruses, they’re not.

1147
00:51:20.024 --> 00:51:22.149
We need the same messages
across the country, the

1148
00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:24.649
science isn’t different.

1149
00:51:24.649 --> 00:51:27.190
We should however
recognise high areas of

1150
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.107
infection and low areas
of infection do require

1151
00:51:29.107 --> 00:51:30.357
differences, but we don’t

1152
00:51:30.357 --> 00:51:31.399
require differences
in

1153
00:51:31.399 --> 00:51:36.357
four nations.

1154
00:51:36.649 --> 00:51:39.024
Please can we get that
clarity done and let’s get

1155
00:51:39.024 --> 00:51:40.190
together as a nation now.

1156
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.357
This is a serious
illness, it kills and it

1157
00:51:42.357 --> 00:51:45.274
leaves a huge proportion of people
ill for a long, long time.

1158
00:51:45.274 --> 00:51:46.982
When they’re ill,
they’re not working and

1159
00:51:46.982 --> 00:51:48.024
contributing to society either.

1160
00:51:48.024 --> 00:51:49.940
So that’s covered a few
things there, Fiona.

1161
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.024
And Helen, when you hearJohn
talking about the fact and we have

1162
00:51:53.024 --> 00:51:55.690
seen stuff online about people
getting together and having a party

1163
00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:59.024
after 10 o’clock, what does that
make you feel as a GP and someone

1164
00:51:59.024 --> 00:52:00.190
representing a health
care professional?

1165
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.357
It’s so frustrating,
it’s sad it is frustrating, because

1166
00:52:02.357 --> 00:52:04.649
It’s so frustrating,
it’s sad it is frustrating, because

1167
00:52:04.649 --> 00:52:08.524
I know people fundamentally
want to do the right thing.

1168
00:52:08.524 --> 00:52:10.899
But this pressurised
system is a problem.

1169
00:52:10.899 --> 00:52:14.649
There is pressure and
people want release.

1170
00:52:14.649 --> 00:52:17.815
But the release of everyone ending
out on the street at the same

1171
00:52:17.815 --> 00:52:18.857
time is not helping.

1172
00:52:18.857 --> 00:52:22.065
So I’m sad and I’m frustrated
and Ijust wanted to

1173
00:52:22.065 --> 00:52:24.857
reiterate the messages, because
the science is really simple.

1174
00:52:24.857 --> 00:52:27.024
This virus isn’t getting
less virulent, it’s

1175
00:52:27.024 --> 00:52:30.107
not getting milder, it’sjust
as deadly as it was on day one.

1176
00:52:30.107 --> 00:52:32.274
But we are testing more,
so we are finding

1177
00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:33.440
more of the milder cases.

1178
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.440
Please, please, follow the rules.

1179
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.357
Look after one another.

1180
00:52:37.357 --> 00:52:39.732
And we will get through this.

1181
00:52:39.732 --> 00:52:41.690
But it’s not going
to be over quickly.

1182
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.899
We’ve got a long haul ahead of us.

1183
00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:47.232
We have got a few minutes left
and I want to get one more

1184
00:52:47.232 --> 00:52:48.899
question in from Gordon McGregor.

1185
00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.524
Do you think the
Government should help

1186
00:52:50.524 --> 00:52:52.732
help football clubs financially
when their players are still

1187
00:52:52.732 --> 00:52:54.107
receiving massive salaries,
compared to an

1188
00:52:54.107 --> 00:52:56.732
average person’s wage?

1189
00:52:56.732 --> 00:53:01.732
Right, well Alison,
Carlisle United FC, which

1190
00:53:03.065 --> 00:53:05.190
plays in League Two,
is warning it faces

1191
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:08.899
a 1.2 million short fall
and

1192
00:53:08.899 --> 00:53:11.815
I’m thinking about obviously
you have got Merseyside that’s going

1193
00:53:11.815 --> 00:53:14.482
into, or the Liverpool area that’s
going into restrictions, that is

1194
00:53:14.482 --> 00:53:18.190
going to affect the clubs there too.

1195
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:23.190
Yeah, football clubs are in a really
bad situation and you know we heard

1196
00:53:24.399 --> 00:53:26.815
the pointjust about new
players’ wages, which is one

1197
00:53:26.815 --> 00:53:28.149
side of it.

1198
00:53:28.149 --> 00:53:32.524
Which we have needed to regulate
better and have a better

1199
00:53:32.524 --> 00:53:35.607
system of governance in our national
game for many years and the virus

1200
00:53:35.607 --> 00:53:38.315
has shown this in sharp relief.

1201
00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.024
Do you think the
Premier League should

1202
00:53:40.024 --> 00:53:41.440
dip into their pockets?

1203
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.274
I think the Premier
League have got to

1204
00:53:43.274 --> 00:53:46.399
contribute, but I think
it’s bigger than that.

1205
00:53:46.399 --> 00:53:48.565
The Government promised
in their 2019 manifesto a fan—led

1206
00:53:48.565 --> 00:53:51.107
review of football governance
and the minister says he wants to

1207
00:53:51.107 --> 00:53:54.315
include finances as well.

1208
00:53:54.315 --> 00:53:56.399
Labour agree with this and I

1209
00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:59.274
have been banging on about football
finances and governance since I was

1210
00:53:59.274 --> 00:54:01.857
first elected as a
member of Parliament?

1211
00:54:01.857 --> 00:54:02.857
2010.

1212
00:54:02.857 --> 00:54:05.274
That’s a lot of talk
about football in ten years.

1213
00:54:05.274 --> 00:54:07.107
So, what would Labour do now?

1214
00:54:07.107 --> 00:54:10.024
We have written to
the Government offering

1215
00:54:10.024 --> 00:54:15.024
our principles for reviewing
the regulations to make it better.

1216
00:54:15.024 --> 00:54:17.190
Right now, if I was
the ministerfor sport

1217
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.607
now, I would be getting
the Premier League, the EFL

1218
00:54:19.607 --> 00:54:24.107
and all the parties round the table
and say, can we all

1219
00:54:24.107 --> 00:54:26.815
stick to the principle that no
football supporter in this country

1220
00:54:26.815 --> 00:54:31.732
should lose a much—loved sports
club, just because of the virus.

1221
00:54:31.732 --> 00:54:34.857
Now we know that the finances
of football have been, shall I say,

1222
00:54:34.857 --> 00:54:36.940
challenging for a long time anyway.

1223
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.274
So we have got to separate out
the changes that we need for the

1224
00:54:40.274 --> 00:54:45.274
medium and the long—term
viability of the game.

1225
00:54:46.399 --> 00:54:50.899
Which is a way of protecting clubs
in the short—term, if it is just the

1226
00:54:50.899 --> 00:54:52.315
virus that will tip them over.

1227
00:54:52.315 --> 00:54:54.940
Because I’ve seen you know whether
it’s what happened with Macclesfield

1228
00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.065
recently or what happened with Bury,
I have seen how it impacts people,

1229
00:54:58.065 --> 00:54:59.274
supporters when clubs go under.

1230
00:54:59.274 --> 00:55:01.440
It’s part of your identity.

1231
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.357
It’s who you are and football
supporters deserve

1232
00:55:03.357 --> 00:55:05.274
much better than they’re
getting at the moment.

1233
00:55:05.274 --> 00:55:07.274
David?

1234
00:55:07.274 --> 00:55:09.649
I support a League One club
in Scotland which is

1235
00:55:09.649 --> 00:55:12.315
not players on massive salaries
and I think one of things

1236
00:55:12.315 --> 00:55:14.482
that is really important for people
to remember is,

1237
00:55:14.482 --> 00:55:17.607
yes, there are big football clubs
out there, players that are on big

1238
00:55:17.607 --> 00:55:20.190
wages, but for the vast majority
of communities, it’s small clubs,

1239
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.899
small teams that are really
struggling at

1240
00:55:21.899 --> 00:55:22.940
the moment.

1241
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.024
But one of the points that
I was making in the House of

1242
00:55:26.024 --> 00:55:29.149
Commons this week to the Government
as well it is about being mindful,

1243
00:55:29.149 --> 00:55:31.065
in my own constituents
at Celtic football club,

1244
00:55:31.065 --> 00:55:32.107
the biggest football

1245
00:55:32.107 --> 00:55:33.149
club in Scotland.

1246
00:55:33.149 --> 00:55:33.315
L111:

1247
00:55:33.315 --> 00:55:34.732
But it is about making sure that
peopla

1248
00:55:34.732 --> 00:55:35.774
But it is about making sure that
people remember there is a local

1249
00:55:35.774 --> 00:55:38.774
people remember there is a local
economic aspect. A 60,000 seater

1250
00:55:38.774 --> 00:55:42.149
economic aspect. A 60,000 seater
stadium. What would you do to help

1251
00:55:42.149 --> 00:55:42.524
stadium. what would you do to help
the clubs

1252
00:55:42.524 --> 00:55:44.815
stadium. What would you do to help
the clubs lower down? We need to

1253
00:55:44.815 --> 00:55:46.274
the clubs lower down? We need to
look at the financial support that

1254
00:55:46.274 --> 00:55:51.190
look at the financial support that
is offered and the package that was

1255
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.649
is offered and the package that was
brought forward by the Treasury is

1256
00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:58.815
brought forward by the Treasury is
unadequate. I don’t think Rishi

1257
00:55:58.815 --> 00:56:00.857
unadequate. I don’t think Rishi
Sunak can get to Christmas without

1258
00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:01.399
Sunak ran get to Christmas without
looking at the

1259
00:56:01.399 --> 00:56:02.649
Sunak can get to Christmas without
looking at the packages, what he has

1260
00:56:02.649 --> 00:56:04.982
looking at the packages, what he has
offered is it not going to cut it

1261
00:56:04.982 --> 00:56:07.149
offered is it not going to cut it
for communities and clubs and people

1262
00:56:07.149 --> 00:56:07.524
for communities and clubs and peopla
who are

1263
00:56:07.524 --> 00:56:10.399
for communities and clubs and people
who are struggling. Stuart, are you

1264
00:56:10.399 --> 00:56:13.065
who are struggling. Stuart, are you
a footy fan? Yes, I’m a

1265
00:56:13.065 --> 00:56:15.607
who are struggling. Stuart, are you
a footy fan? Yes, I’m 3 Spurs fan.

1266
00:56:15.607 --> 00:56:16.149
a footy fan? Yes, I’m a Spurs fan.
There is a

1267
00:56:16.149 --> 00:56:18.732
a footy fan? Yes, I’m 3 Spurs fan.
There is a deal in place and the

1268
00:56:18.732 --> 00:56:20.982
There is a deal in place and the
argument is about the access of

1269
00:56:20.982 --> 00:56:24.024
argument is about the access of
foreign players coming in. It is a

1270
00:56:24.024 --> 00:56:24.232
foreign players coming in. It is a
three-way

1271
00:56:24.232 --> 00:56:27.607
foreign players coming in. It is a
three—way trade off. If they let

1272
00:56:27.607 --> 00:56:28.232
three-way trade off. If they let
more foreign

1273
00:56:28.232 --> 00:56:29.690
three—way trade off. If they let
more foreign players in, they will

1274
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:32.315
more foreign players in, they will
give the money to the EFL. But the

1275
00:56:32.315 --> 00:56:34.982
give the money to the EFL. But the
industry needs to help itself.

1276
00:56:34.982 --> 00:56:36.107
industry needs to help itself.
Because that gentleman said, the

1277
00:56:36.107 --> 00:56:36.982
Because that gentleman said, the
peopla at

1278
00:56:36.982 --> 00:56:39.690
Because that gentleman said, the
people at the top end have got a

1279
00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:41.357
people at the top end have got a
disproportionate amount of the

1280
00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:47.357
disproportionate amount of the
income and the revenues.

1281
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:50.399
income and the revenues. Gem? Our
[oral team

1282
00:56:50.399 --> 00:56:51.565
income and the revenues. Gem? Our
local team have suffered, but they

1283
00:56:51.565 --> 00:56:52.232
[oral team have suffered, but they
have kept

1284
00:56:52.232 --> 00:56:53.982
local team have suffered, but they
have kept most of the money that

1285
00:56:53.982 --> 00:56:56.940
have kept most of the money that
people have paid for their season

1286
00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.524
people have paid for their season
tickets and they’re allowing their

1287
00:56:58.524 --> 00:56:59.357
tickets and therre allowing their
fans to

1288
00:56:59.357 --> 00:57:03.774
tickets and they’re allowing their
fans to watch it online. So they’re

1289
00:57:03.774 --> 00:57:03.982
fans to watch it online. So therre
maintaining

1290
00:57:03.982 --> 00:57:05.732
fans to watch it online. So they’re
maintaining some of the income and

1291
00:57:05.732 --> 00:57:07.774
maintaining some of the income and
giving something back to if fans.

1292
00:57:07.774 --> 00:57:07.940
giving something back to iffans.
which

1293
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.982
giving something back to if fans.
Which is good. It is a positive

1294
00:57:10.982 --> 00:57:12.149
which is good. It is a positive
step. Halon,

1295
00:57:12.149 --> 00:57:14.274
Which is good. It is a positive
step. Helen, you’re nodding? Yeah

1296
00:57:14.274 --> 00:57:16.274
step. Helan, you’re nodding? Yeah
this is a

1297
00:57:16.274 --> 00:57:17.774
step. Helen, you’re nodding? Yeah
this is a much wider issue than

1298
00:57:17.774 --> 00:57:20.690
this is a much wider issue than
football clubs and football should

1299
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:23.024
football clubs and football should
support football, the richer clubs

1300
00:57:23.024 --> 00:57:24.440
support football, the richer clubs
should support the other clubs, but

1301
00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.440
should support the other clubs, but
we need to think of rugby and

1302
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:27.732
we need to think of mgby and
cricket

1303
00:57:27.732 --> 00:57:32.190
we need to think of rugby and
cricket grounds and the facilities

1304
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:33.690
cricket grounds and the facilities
that are suffering. There are other

1305
00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:35.315
that are suffering. There are other
sports out there, so let’s think

1306
00:57:35.315 --> 00:57:39.357
sports out there, so let’s think
about them all. And Grant, the

1307
00:57:39.357 --> 00:57:43.607
about them all. And Grant, the
Government has promised an emergency

1308
00:57:43.607 --> 00:57:45.524
Government has promised an emergency
grant to the fifth tier of football,

1309
00:57:45.524 --> 00:57:47.815
grant to the fifth tier of football,
what about the rest of it. Will the

1310
00:57:47.815 --> 00:57:53.607
what about the rest of it. Will the
Government pitch in or leave

1311
00:57:54.982 --> 00:57:59.940
Government pitch in or leave to it
the Premier League. The league has a

1312
00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.857
the Premier League. The league has a
lot to give, Carlisle are playing

1313
00:58:01.857 --> 00:58:02.024
lot to give, (“artisla are playing
Barrow

1314
00:58:02.024 --> 00:58:06.065
lot to give, Carlisle are playing
Barrow on Saturday. You have been

1315
00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:09.065
Barrow on Saturday. You have been
swotting! They will need to be able

1316
00:58:09.065 --> 00:58:13.524
swotting! They will need to be able
to carry on playing, as has been

1317
00:58:13.524 --> 00:58:15.190
to carry on playing, as has been
said and we are looking at things

1318
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:18.107
said and we are looking at things
like how you can use technology in

1319
00:58:18.107 --> 00:58:18.357
like how you ran use technology in
football

1320
00:58:18.357 --> 00:58:20.274
like how you can use technology in
football to help the clubs and

1321
00:58:20.274 --> 00:58:23.399
football to help the clubs and
audiences. But it is something that

1322
00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:27.690
audiences. But it is something that
has been hard and I think the

1323
00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:29.065
has been hard and I think the
Premier League is a part of the

1324
00:58:29.065 --> 00:58:31.065
Premier League is a part of the
solution, as well as Government and

1325
00:58:31.065 --> 00:58:34.190
solution, as well as Government and
the taxpayer. Gordon, this was your

1326
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:36.649
the taxpayer. Gordon, this was your
question, what is your view? I think

1327
00:58:36.649 --> 00:58:39.690
question, what is your view? I think
that the football clubs should be in

1328
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:42.940
that the football clubs should be in
a way, if you can demonstrate you

1329
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.857
a way, if you ran demonstrate you
ran by social

1330
00:58:43.857 --> 00:58:44.565
a way, if you can demonstrate you
can by social distancing you can

1331
00:58:44.565 --> 00:58:45.940
ran by social distancing you ran
stop the

1332
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.774
can by social distancing you can
stop the spread of the virus, the

1333
00:58:48.774 --> 00:58:50.149
stop the spread of the virus, the
stadiums have all seated numbers and

1334
00:58:50.149 --> 00:58:52.482
stadiums have all seated numbers and
I think they should be allowed a

1335
00:58:52.482 --> 00:58:53.732
I think they should be allowed a
certain amount of supporters to

1336
00:58:53.732 --> 00:58:56.940
certain amount of supporters to
watch the game and that would be

1337
00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.440
watch the game and that would be
alleviate some of the pressure for

1338
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.232
alleviate some of the pressure for
the fans and the clubs. But the

1339
00:59:01.232 --> 00:59:02.440
the fans and the clubs. But the
governing bodies should get together

1340
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.649
governing bodies should get together
and I don’t think the Government

1341
00:59:03.649 --> 00:59:05.565
and I don’t think the Government
should be involved. I also think the

1342
00:59:05.565 --> 00:59:06.690
should be involved. I also think the
players have a responsibility as

1343
00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:09.774
players have a responsibility as
well. Some of these players, in the

1344
00:59:09.774 --> 00:59:11.815
well. Some of these players, in the
lower league ts they’re not earning

1345
00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:12.815
lower league ts therre not earning
as much,

1346
00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:15.482
lower league ts they’re not earning
as much, when we were furloughed and

1347
00:59:15.482 --> 00:59:18.940
as much, when we were furloughed and
people were living off 80% of their

1348
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:19.524
people were living off 8096 of their
wages, some

1349
00:59:19.524 --> 00:59:21.440
people were living off 80% of their
wages, some of them could live off

1350
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:21.940
wages, some of them could live off
101: of

1351
00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.940
wages, some of them could live off
10% of their wages. I do think it

1352
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.774
1096 of their wages. I do think it
needs to

1353
00:59:24.774 --> 00:59:26.107
10% of their wages. I do think it
needs to be all the governing bodies

1354
00:59:26.107 --> 00:59:27.857
needs to be all the governing bodies
need to get together. I don’t think

1355
00:59:27.857 --> 00:59:30.482
need to get together. I don’t think
the Government should be involved.

1356
00:59:30.482 --> 00:59:31.690
the Government should be involved.
Because it is not

1357
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:32.190
the Government should be involved.
Because it is notjust football,

1358
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.982
Because it is not just football,
there is

1359
00:59:32.982 --> 00:59:34.024
Because it is notjust football,
there is other sports and where they

1360
00:59:34.024 --> 00:59:34.607
there is other sports and where they
ran they

1361
00:59:34.607 --> 00:59:35.690
there is other sports and where they
can they should help the lower

1362
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:36.399
ran they should help the lower
dubs.

1363
00:59:36.399 --> 00:59:39.649
can they should help the lower
clubs. That is my opinion. Grant it

1364
00:59:39.649 --> 00:59:40.274
dubs. That is my opinion. Grant it
is a

1365
00:59:40.274 --> 00:59:40.482
dubs. That is my opinion. Grant it
haum

1366
00:59:40.482 --> 00:59:41.232
dubs. That is my opinion. Grant it
is a rare thing

1367
00:59:41.232 --> 00:59:41.940
clubs. That is my opinion. Grant it
is a rare thing where people tell

1368
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:42.440
is a rare thing where peopla tell
you the

1369
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.024
is a rare thing where people tell
you the Government shouldn’t be

1370
00:59:43.024 --> 00:59:45.065
you the Government shouldn’t be
involved. Enjoy that moment while it

1371
00:59:45.065 --> 00:59:48.732
involved. Enjoy that moment whila it
lasts. The point

1372
00:59:48.732 --> 00:59:49.399
involved. Enjoy that moment while it
lasts. The point about letting the

1373
00:59:49.399 --> 00:59:50.024
lasts. The point about latting the
spectators in

1374
00:59:50.024 --> 00:59:50.899
lasts. The point about letting the
spectators in the stadium, that is

1375
00:59:50.899 --> 00:59:52.940
spectators in the stadium, that is
something we were hoping to move

1376
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.190
something we were hoping to move
towards, but we have this you know

1377
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:57.065
towards, but we have this you know
absolute desire to have schools and

1378
00:59:57.065 --> 01:00:00.357
absolute desire to have schools and
work back and we can’t if the R rate

1379
01:00:00.357 --> 01:00:02.274
work back and we can’t if the R rate
is above 1 do other discretionary

01:00:02.274 --> 01:00:02.857
is above 1 do other discretionary
things. when

1381
01:00:02.857 --> 01:00:04.232
is above 1 do other discretionary
things. When we get it down, we can

1382
01:00:04.232 --> 01:00:04.774
things. when we get it down, we ran
do the

1383
01:00:04.774 --> 01:00:06.024
things. When we get it down, we can
do the other things that will help

1384
01:00:06.024 --> 01:00:08.065
do the other things that will help
the clubs and other sports. Our hour

bye-bye-

1422
01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:42.399
I lost half of my family

1423
01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.899
because of some person’s hate.

1424
01:01:44.899 --> 01:01:48.024
BBC TWO searches with families
looking for justice.

1425
01:01:48.024 --> 01:01:49.732
We’re investigating a crime

1426
01:01:49.732 --> 01:01:51.690
because our government isn’t.

1427
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.440
We want to know why this happened.

1428
01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:01.524
Your father has something
to tell you.

1429
01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:03.024
# I don’t wanna lose... #

1430
01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:05.149
No—one’s perfect.
I thought she was.

1431
01:02:05.149 --> 01:02:07.607
Unless, of course, you want to
tell me something I don’t know.

1432
01:02:07.607 --> 01:02:09.940
To me, it seems like you want
your life. That’s not what...

1433
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.232
I know, but I’m saying go do it.

1434
01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:13.815
Don’t fall off the wagon,
because Maya needs you.

1435
01:02:20.024 --> 01:02:22.774
It’s election night.
That’s the moment where he realised,

1436
01:02:22.774 --> 01:02:24.857
"Oh, my gosh.
This is really about to happen."

1437
01:02:24.857 --> 01:02:27.024
President Trump is a star,
he’s an icon.

1438
01:02:27.024 --> 01:02:30.274
He hates for anyone
to get more shine than him.

1439
01:02:30.274 --> 01:02:32.732
At first,
Tmmp is maybe a little uncertain,

1440
01:02:32.732 --> 01:02:35.607
but I think he rediscovered that his
inner voice was the right voice.

1441
01:02:35.607 --> 01:02:38.857
He called me a liar, and I said,
"I won’t be bullied any more."

1442
01:02:38.857 --> 01:02:42.190
From reality TV star
to Leader of the Free World.

1443
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:44.315
The inside story
of the last four years.

1444
01:02:59.774 --> 01:03:02.107
Sarah! That’s Edie.
This is Bella.

1445
01:03:02.107 --> 01:03:03.524
Pharrell. Lily.
Nicola.

1446
01:03:03.524 --> 01:03:05.024
Caitlin. My son.
It’s my girlfriend.

1447
01:03:05.024 --> 01:03:06.815
My husband. My brother.
My wife—to—be.

1448
01:03:06.815 --> 01:03:09.024
He was a miracle. Made my heart
beat. Been going out for two years.

1449
01:03:09.024 --> 01:03:11.274
He’s the heir to my throne.
Hejust grew on me. She’s my life.

1450
01:03:11.274 --> 01:03:13.482
why don’t you have a picture of me?
Erm...

1451
01:03:13.482 --> 01:03:16.690
Just the way that she says things
are funny! She’s amazing.

1452
01:03:19.024 --> 01:03:21.315
He’s just been there for
every pivotal moment of my life.

1453
01:03:25.024 --> 01:03:27.107
Protect YOUR loved ones.
Get the app.

1454
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.399
50, Chris, Adam isn’t
here but you are.

1455
01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:53.774
Yeah, and it’s great to be back,
not least because usually

1456
01:03:53.774 --> 01:03:56.024
when Adam’s on holiday,
lots of stuff happens.

1457
01:03:56.024 --> 01:03:58.607
And, actually, today,
on Thursday as we record,

1458
01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:02.065
there’s been rather a lot of news.

1459
01:04:02.065 --> 01:04:05.190
There’s been a lot of news and it’s
been a busy old week.

1460
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.857
We’ve had a slew of regulations,
millions more people now living

1461
01:04:07.857 --> 01:04:10.024
under limited lockdowns.

1462
01:04:10.024 --> 01:04:12.482
Unfortunately, still the spread
of the disease, although a story

1463
01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:14.649
today that it might be slowing
a little bit.

1464
01:04:14.649 --> 01:04:16.899
But also this week,
the return of satire.

1465
01:04:16.899 --> 01:04:19.232
Yes.

1466
01:04:19.232 --> 01:04:22.774
What did you say
this show is called?

1467
01:04:22.774 --> 01:04:25.190
The name, or the nomine
to the Romans, little Latin

1468
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:26.274
pun, is Spitting Image.

1469
01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:27.315
Spitting Scrimmage?

1470
01:04:27.315 --> 01:04:29.024
Spitting Image.

1471
01:04:29.024 --> 01:04:34.024
Spitting Cribbage?

1472
01:04:35.274 --> 01:04:37.649
It a sketch show with puppet
caricatures of real people

1473
01:04:37.649 --> 01:04:39.107
and it can be rather nasty.

1474
01:04:39.107 --> 01:04:40.107
Puppets?

1475
01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:42.524
That is the very most moronic
thing I’ve ever heard.

1476
01:04:42.524 --> 01:04:45.649
My puppet is going to be the best
puppet and I love it.

1477
01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:46.732
LAUGHTER.

1478
01:04:46.732 --> 01:04:49.815
The return of Spitting Image,
and a bit later on we’ll be talking

1479
01:04:49.815 --> 01:04:54.149
to the voice behind both of those
characters who’s been involved

1480
01:04:54.149 --> 01:04:55.482
with creating the show.

1481
01:04:55.482 --> 01:04:58.607
And for a blast of nostalgia,
we’ve got Katya back to talk Brexit.

1482
01:04:58.607 --> 01:04:59.857
We have!

1483
01:04:59.857 --> 01:05:02.274
So welcome to a little bit
of Brexitcast, this week’s Newscast.

1484
01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:03.357
Newscast.

1485
01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:04.857
Newscast from the BBC.

1486
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.524
So, it’s Laura this
week at Westminster.

1487
01:05:10.524 --> 01:05:12.732
And it’s Chris, glad to be
back at Westminster,

1488
01:05:12.732 --> 01:05:16.190
sitting in for Adam, who’s away.

1489
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.899
So, there has been, this week,
number one, lots of confusion
