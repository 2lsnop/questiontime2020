Strictly stars of 2020 have
hit the dance ﬂoor.

47
00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.533
And no-one wants to be the first
to go home.

48
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.699
This is going to be one fierce
competition.

49
00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:30.574
Sometimes life happens,

50
00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:32.658
it arrives,

51
00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.408
and you just have to deal with it.

52
00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:36.949
We’re going to be OK, aren’t we?

53
00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:39.033
I’m illicit now.

54
00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:42.366
I just want the truth.

55
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.616
The Six Nations is back, and it’s
going down to the final game.

56

The Six Nations bursts into life!

France vs Ireland.

# Your silly games... #

62
00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:20.699
We mustn’t be victims,
but protagonists of our stories.

# ..Silly games... #

64
00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:29.199
As individuals,
we have an impossible battle.

65
00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.533
As a collective, we stand a chance.

Good evening, Pannell.

110
00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:27.741
In view of the report released
today by the Equalities

111
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:29.699
and Human Rights Commission,
which identified serious failings

112
00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.824
by the Labour Party in dealing
with anti—semitic racism,

113
00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:36.824
should just one individual be
held to account?

114
00:04:37.283 --> 00:04:43.574
Chris? It is a damning report, it
finds the Labour Party acted

115
00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.741
finds the Labour Party acted
unlawfully. It finds that

116
00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:47.366
finds the Labour Party acted
unlawfully. It finds thatJeremy

117
00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:47.491
unlawfully. It finds that jeremy
Corbyn’s

118
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.741
unlawfully. It finds thatJeremy
Corbyn’s office effectively covered

119
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:49.908
Corbyn’s office effectively covered
“P

120
00:04:49.908 --> 00:04:50.241
Corbyn’s office effectively covered
up 23

121
00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:51.241
Corbyn’s office effectively covered
up 23 different allegations of

122
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:53.241
up 23 different allegations of
anti—Semitism. But I think it goes

123
00:04:53.241 --> 00:04:53.491
anti-Semitism. But I think it goes
beyond

124
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:55.949
anti—Semitism. But I think it goes
beyond Jeremy Corbyn. I think Keir

125
00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:56.158
beyond jeremy Corbyn. I think Keir
Starmer

126
00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:58.449
beyond Jeremy Corbyn. I think Keir
Starmer has questions to answer

127
00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.533
Starmer has questions to answer
himself. Because for five years Keir

128
00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.741
himself. Because for five years Keir
Starmer sat on the Labour front

129
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:01.908
Starmer sat on the labour front
bench

130
00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:04.324
Starmer sat on the Labour front
bench and said nothing while this

131
00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:04.908
bench and said nothing whila this
was going on.

132
00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:06.699
bench and said nothing while this
was going on. I didn’t hear him

133
00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.366
was going on. I didn’t hear him
condemning this activity are holding

134
00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:09.324
condemning this activity are holding
jeremy

135
00:05:09.324 --> 00:05:10.533
condemning this activity are holding
Jeremy Corbyn to account, unlike

136
00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:11.949
jeremy Corbyn to account, unlike
many other

137
00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.033
Jeremy Corbyn to account, unlike
many other Labour MPs and many

138
00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:13.283
many other labour MPs and many
labour

139
00:05:13.283 --> 00:05:13.574
many other Labour MPs and many
Labour frontbenchers,

140
00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:14.741
many other Labour MPs and many
Labourfrontbenchers, he did not

141
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.366
labour frontbenchers, he did not
resign. He said

142
00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:17.033
Labourfrontbenchers, he did not
resign. He said nothing and he

143
00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.283
resign. He said nothing and he
defended Jeremy Corbyn and he

144
00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:19.408
defended jeremy Corbyn and he
promoted

145
00:05:19.408 --> 00:05:20.616
defended Jeremy Corbyn and he
promoted Jeremy Corbyn as a

146
00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:20.699
promoted jeremy Corbyn as a
potential

147
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.449
promoted Jeremy Corbyn as a
potential prime minister less than a

148
00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.116
potential prime minister less than a
year ago. I think Keir Starmer needs

149
00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:26.866
year ago. I think Keir Starmer needs
to do two things if he is serious

150
00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.241
to do two things if he is serious
about fixing this. Firstly, he

151
00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:30.741
about fixing this. Firstly, he
should apologise personally for his

152
00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:32.199
should apologise personally for his
failure to speak out on this issue

153
00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.783
failure to speak out on this issue
when he was on the front bench. It

154
00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:36.866
when he was on the front bench. It
was convenient for him to sit there

155
00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:38.658
was convenient for him to sit there
and stay quiet in the hope that he

156
00:05:38.658 --> 00:05:41.991
and stay quiet in the hope that he
would take over as leader rather

157
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:44.949
would take over as leader rather
cynically. Secondly, it is not

158
00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:45.158
would take over as leader rather
cynically. Secondly, it is notjust

159
00:05:45.158 --> 00:05:45.574
cynically. Secondly, it is not just
to suspend

160
00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:46.366
cynically. Secondly, it is notjust
to suspend Jeremy Corbyn, he should

161
00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:46.741
to suspend jeremy Corbyn, he should
kick jeremy

162
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:47.741
to suspend Jeremy Corbyn, he should
kickJeremy Corbyn out of the Labour

163
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.158
kick jeremy Corbyn out of the labour
Party because

164
00:05:48.158 --> 00:05:50.741
kickJeremy Corbyn out of the Labour
Party because this report is so

165
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.533
Party because this report is so
damning. Jeremy Corbyn’s response to

166
00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:54.283
damning. jeremy Corbyn’s response to
it, saying it had

167
00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:56.324
damning. Jeremy Corbyn’s response to
it, saying it had been hugely

168
00:05:56.324 --> 00:05:57.449
it, saying it had been hugely
exaggerated for political purposes,

169
00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:03.283
exaggerated for political purposes,
was disgraceful. Keir Starmer needs

170
00:06:03.283 --> 00:06:05.366
was disgraceful. Keir Starmer needs
to do both of those things if he is

171
00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:08.449
to do both of those things if he is
serious. The report found political

172
00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.533
serious. The report found political
interference in anti—Semitism

173
00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:13.033
interference in anti-Semitism
complaints.

174
00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:14.366
interference in anti—Semitism
complaints. It did not use the word

175
00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:17.574
complaints. It did not use the word
cover. Nick, this is not a

176
00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:19.283
cover. Nick, this is not a
comfortable day for you. You were

177
00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:20.741
comfortable day for you. You were
also part of the front bench during

178
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:22.283
also part of the front bench during
all of this. What do you have to

179
00:06:22.283 --> 00:06:25.533
all of this. what do you have to
say? Firstly,

180
00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:26.449
all of this. What do you have to
say? Firstly, this is a shameful day

181
00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.741
say? Firstly, this is a shameful day
for the Labour Party. We accept the

182
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.616
for the labour Party. We accept the
findings of the

183
00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:32.199
for the Labour Party. We accept the
findings of the equality and human

184
00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.324
findings of the equality and human
rights report in the entirety and we

185
00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:37.408
rights report in the entirety and we
will act on the recommendations. But

186
00:06:37.408 --> 00:06:39.658
will act on the recommendations. But
first and foremost I want to

187
00:06:39.658 --> 00:06:41.366
first and foremost I want to
acknowledge the hurt that has been

188
00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.908
acknowledge the hurt that has been
caused to the

189
00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:44.908
acknowledge the hurt that has been
caused to theJewish community over

190
00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:45.449
caused to the jewish community over
the past five

191
00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:46.116
caused to theJewish community over
the past five years. Keir Starmer

192
00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:48.991
the past five years. Keir Starmer
has expressed our profound sorrow

193
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.699
has expressed our profound sorrow
for this. We are profoundly sorry

194
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.366
for this. We are profoundly sorry
for that hurt that has been caused.

195
00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:57.824
for that hurt that has been caused.
Todars report

196
00:06:57.824 --> 00:06:58.533
for that hurt that has been caused.
Today’s report is an appalling,

197
00:06:58.533 --> 00:06:58.908
Todars report is an appalling,
damning

198
00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:00.908
Today’s report is an appalling,
damning report that is before us,

199
00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:04.241
damning report that is before us,
but we now have to act upon the

200
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:05.366
but we now have to act upon the
recommendations of that report. I

201
00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:07.366
recommendations of that report. I
never thought I would be sitting on

202
00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:10.824
never thought I would be sitting on
your show after the last Labour

203
00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:11.116
your show after the last labour
government

204
00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:12.366
your show after the last Labour
government created the Equality and

205
00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.408
government created the Equality and
Human Rights Commission and actually

206
00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:15.991
Human Rights Commission and actually
be speaking about an investigation

207
00:07:15.991 --> 00:07:17.908
be speaking about an investigation
of findings into the Labour Party

208
00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:18.241
offindings into the labour Party
itself, but

209
00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:19.783
of findings into the Labour Party
itself, but that is where we are. We

210
00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:23.991
itself, but that is where we are. We
will now work to ensure that, yes,

211
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:25.283
will now work to ensure that, yes,
our complaints processes are

212
00:07:25.283 --> 00:07:27.158
our complaints processes are
improved, that they are independent,

213
00:07:27.158 --> 00:07:28.949
improved, that they are independent,
they are where they should be, but

214
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.158
they are where they should be, but
we will do more than that. The

215
00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:33.241
we will do more than that. The
answer to this is not

216
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:33.741
we will do more than that. The
answer to this is notjust about

217
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:33.908
answer to this is not just about
process,

218
00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:35.866
answer to this is notjust about
process, important though that is,

219
00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:37.283
process, important though that is,
it is about changing the culture of

220
00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:40.283
it is about changing the culture of
our party so it is a place where

221
00:07:40.283 --> 00:07:42.449
our party so it is a place where
everybody feels welcome and

222
00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:43.866
everybody feels welcome and
everybody feel safe. What Keir

223
00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:46.783
everybody feel safe. What Keir
Starmer has done today with a

224
00:07:46.783 --> 00:07:48.324
Starmer has done today with a
decisive speech of moral clarity is

225
00:07:48.324 --> 00:07:50.741
decisive speech of moral clarity is
to show the way towards that. I know

226
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:54.366
to show the way towards that. I know
there is a long way to go. But his

227
00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:55.699
there is a long way to go. But his
speech and our commitment to taking

228
00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:57.366
speech and our commitment to taking
action on this is the start of that

229
00:07:57.366 --> 00:08:00.866
action on this is the start of that
road. Talking of moral clarity, one

230
00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:05.866
road. Talking of moral clarity, one
of the things that upset many in the

231
00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:06.033
of the things that upset many in the
jewish

232
00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.449
of the things that upset many in the
Jewish community is a Labour’s

233
00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:07.616
jewish community is a Labour’s
refusal

234
00:08:07.616 --> 00:08:10.699
Jewish community is a Labour’s
refusal to accept in full the

235
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.324
refusal to accept in full the
International Holocaust remembrance

236
00:08:14.324 --> 00:08:16.824
International Holocaust remembrance
alliance was back definition of

237
00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:18.241
alliance was back definition of
anti—Semitism in 2018. You endorsed

238
00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:18.741
anti-Semitism in 2018. You endorsed
that

239
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.824
anti—Semitism in 2018. You endorsed
that decision not to accept it. He

240
00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:22.324
that decision not to accept it. He
went out on the airwaves defending

241
00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:25.283
went out on the airwaves defending
the decision not to accept it.

242
00:08:25.283 --> 00:08:25.574
the decision not to accept it.
labour

243
00:08:25.574 --> 00:08:26.283
the decision not to accept it.
Labour changed its position

244
00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:26.949
the decision not to accept it.
Labour changed its positionjust two

245
00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:27.241
labour changed its position just two
months

246
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:30.449
Labour changed its positionjust two
months later. I don’t think that is

247
00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:32.366
months later. I don’t think that is
a fair characterisation of what I

248
00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.783
a fair characterisation of what I
said that day. What I said that day

249
00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:35.241
said that day. what I said that day
was the

250
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:37.824
said that day. What I said that day
was the abuse that was being

251
00:08:37.824 --> 00:08:38.908
was the abuse that was being
referred to, the appalling

252
00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:39.991
referred to, the appalling
anti—Semitic abuse, whatever was in

253
00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:41.741
anti-Semitic abuse, whatever was in
the mle book,

254
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:42.658
anti—Semitic abuse, whatever was in
the rule book, was absolutely wrong

255
00:08:42.658 --> 00:08:43.491
the NI; book, was absolutely wrong
and had

256
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:45.866
the rule book, was absolutely wrong
and had to be dealt with. I also

257
00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:48.158
and had to be dealt with. I also
said the NEC was right to look again

258
00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:50.033
said the NEC was right to look again
at the decision they made not to

259
00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:53.408
at the decision they made not to
adopt all of the examples that went

260
00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:56.241
adopt all of the examples that went
with the definition. But you did not

261
00:08:56.241 --> 00:09:00.741
with the definition. But you did not
accept all those examples, Nick. You

262
00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:03.199
accept all those examples, Nick. You
went out on the Today programme and

263
00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:04.241
went out on the Today programme and
on the airwaves explaining that

264
00:09:04.241 --> 00:09:05.074
on the airwaves explaining that
labour

265
00:09:05.074 --> 00:09:06.408
on the airwaves explaining that
Labour should not accept all those

266
00:09:06.408 --> 00:09:06.741
labour should not accept all those
examples as

267
00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:10.283
Labour should not accept all those
examples as part of that definition.

268
00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.741
examples as part of that definition.
No, that is an unfair

269
00:09:11.741 --> 00:09:13.991
No, that is an unfair
characterisation of what I said in

270
00:09:13.991 --> 00:09:16.741
characterisation of what I said in
the interview, with respect, Fiona.

271
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:18.699
the interview, with respect, Fiona.
What I said was the NEC were right

272
00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:19.158
what I said was the NEC were right
to look

273
00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:22.408
What I said was the NEC were right
to look at it again because of the

274
00:09:22.408 --> 00:09:24.324
to look at it again because of the
decision they made. They had to look

275
00:09:24.324 --> 00:09:27.283
decision they made. They had to look
at it again and they made the right

276
00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:28.199
at it again and they made the right
decision. Look, I

277
00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:28.366
at it again and they made the right
decision. Look, Iwill

278
00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:28.616
at it again and they made the right
decision. Look, Iwillspeak

279
00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:28.866
at it again and they made the right
decision. Look, I will speak about

280
00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:31.491
decision. Look, I will speak about
the fact that I raised the issue of

281
00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:33.408
the fact that I raised the issue of
anti—Semitism with members of the

282
00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:33.699
anti-Semitism with members of the
Shadow

283
00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:36.241
anti—Semitism with members of the
Shadow Cabinet, I was not in the

284
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:37.783
Shadow Cabinet, I was not in the
Shadow Cabinet. I also said when I

285
00:09:37.783 --> 00:09:40.866
Shadow Cabinet. I also said when I
was out on the media that more

286
00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:43.741
was out on the media that more
action had to be taken on

287
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:44.533
action had to be taken on
anti—Semitism. Keir Starmer spoke

288
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:44.991
anti-Semitism. Keir Starmer spoke
with a

289
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:47.241
anti—Semitism. Keir Starmer spoke
with a cabinet about it and to the

290
00:09:47.241 --> 00:09:48.783
with a cabinet about it and to the
media. But the reality is we all

291
00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:51.408
media. But the reality is we all
have to accept today the failure of

292
00:09:51.408 --> 00:09:53.741
have to accept today the failure of
collective leadership, that is what

293
00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:54.241
collactive leadership, that is what
that

294
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.116
collective leadership, that is what
that report makes absolutely clear.

295
00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:56.741
that report makes absolutely dear.
I am not

296
00:09:56.741 --> 00:09:58.491
that report makes absolutely clear.
I am not shying away from it, I

297
00:09:58.491 --> 00:10:04.699
I am not shying away from it, I
accept totally that report. Today we

298
00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:06.199
accept totally that report. Today we
are under this new leadership with

299
00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.824
are under this new leadership with
Keir Starmer, we have made tackling

300
00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:11.199
Keir Starmer, we have made tackling
anti—Semitism at the very top

301
00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:11.824
anti-Semitism at the very top
priority. But I

302
00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:13.574
anti—Semitism at the very top
priority. But I have always asked to

303
00:10:13.574 --> 00:10:15.074
priority. But I have always asked to
be judged on

304
00:10:15.074 --> 00:10:15.574
priority. But I have always asked to
bejudged on actions, not

305
00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:16.324
priority. But I have always asked to
be judged on actions, not words.

306
00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:16.574
priority. But I have always asked to
bejudged on actions, not words. I

307
00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.116
be judged on actions, not words. I
see today as

308
00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.116
bejudged on actions, not words. I
see today as the start of that and

309
00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:20.699
see today as the start of that and
Keir Starmer is showing this morning

310

Keir Starmer is showing this morning

to try to ensure that the scourge of
anti—Semitism is driven out of our

314
00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:30.574
anti-Semitism is driven out of our
party and it is a

315
00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:31.699
anti—Semitism is driven out of our
party and it is a safe and welcoming

316
00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:33.866
party and it is a safe and welcoming
place, which is the Labour Party I

317
00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:34.283
place, which is the labour Party I
want to

318
00:10:34.283 --> 00:10:35.533
place, which is the Labour Party I
want to see. Keir Starmer had five

319
00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.824
want to see. Keir Starmer had five
years to take action and in those

320
00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:39.866
years to take action and in those
five years in the Shadow Cabinet

321
00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:41.658
five years in the Shadow Cabinet
supporting Jeremy Corbyn he did

322
00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:42.074
supporting jeremy Corbyn he did
nothing, he

323
00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:42.699
supporting Jeremy Corbyn he did
nothing, he should apologise for

324
00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:46.866
nothing, he should apologise for
that. Can I

325
00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:49.283
nothing, he should apologise for
that. Can Ijust say I want to talk

326
00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:49.408
that. (“an I just say I want to talk
about

327
00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:49.991
that. Can Ijust say I want to talk
about trauma because sometimes

328
00:10:49.991 --> 00:10:52.033
about trauma because sometimes
politicians talk about issues and

329
00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:55.908
politicians talk about issues and
they talk about things that call

330
00:10:55.908 --> 00:10:56.116
they talk about things that all
cold

331
00:10:56.116 --> 00:10:57.741
they talk about things that call
cold and they do not talk about

332
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.908
cold and they do not talk about
things that are hot and one of those

333
00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:02.824
things that are hot and one of those
trauma. I am a former deputy chair

334
00:11:02.824 --> 00:11:05.074
trauma. I am a former deputy chair
of the British Museum and I was

335
00:11:05.074 --> 00:11:06.824
of the British Museum and I was
invited a year—and—a—half ago by the

336
00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:08.741
invited a year-and-a-half ago by the
director to

337
00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:09.741
invited a year—and—a—half ago by the
director to create a project around

338
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:10.783
director to create a project around
around reclamation. We decided to

339
00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:14.783
around reclamation. We decided to
look at African enslavement and the

340
00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:15.741
look at African enslavement and the
enslavement of people of African

341
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:21.741
enslavement of people of African
ancestry. And to look at trauma, the

342
00:11:21.741 --> 00:11:23.074
ancestry. And to look at trauma, the
trauma that people can hold inside

343
00:11:23.074 --> 00:11:24.283
trauma that peopla ran hold inside
of

344
00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:27.824
trauma that people can hold inside
of themselves, even if you did not

345
00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:29.991
of themselves, even if you did not
experience it yourself. It is handed

346
00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:33.158
experience it yourself. It is handed
down by generation to generation to

347
00:11:33.158 --> 00:11:34.324
down by generation to generation to
generation to generation, and it is

348
00:11:34.324 --> 00:11:37.324
generation to generation, and it is
real. And for me if a black person

349
00:11:37.324 --> 00:11:39.324
real. And for me if a black person
tells me they are not safe, they

350
00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.783
tells me they are not safe, they
don’t feel safe in an environment,

351
00:11:41.783 --> 00:11:44.949
don’t feel safe in an environment,
they feel it is racist and it is

352
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:47.283
they feel it is racist and it is
racist, I listen. We have to listen

353
00:11:47.283 --> 00:11:49.158
racist, I listen. We have to listen
because of that trauma of

354
00:11:49.158 --> 00:11:50.616
because of that trauma of
enslavement. I am going to say the

355
00:11:50.616 --> 00:11:52.533
enslavement. I am going to say the
same thing about the

356
00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:53.491
enslavement. I am going to say the
same thing about theJewish people.

357
00:11:53.491 --> 00:11:53.949
same thing about the jewish peopla.
If jewish

358
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:55.824
same thing about theJewish people.
IfJewish people tell you someplace

359
00:11:55.824 --> 00:11:56.491
If jewish peopla tell you someplace
is

360
00:11:56.491 --> 00:11:58.908
IfJewish people tell you someplace
is unsafe for them, they don’t feel

361
00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:01.324
is unsafe for them, they don’t feel
good, it feels bad, they are holding

362
00:12:01.324 --> 00:12:03.866
good, it feels bad, they are holding
trauma and we have to understand

363
00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:06.074
trauma and we have to understand
that. We have to begin to talk about

364
00:12:06.074 --> 00:12:07.991
that. We have to begin to talk about
that. People may think it is trivial

365
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:10.574
that. People may think it is trivial
or it didn’t exist or it doesn’t

366
00:12:10.574 --> 00:12:13.324
or it didn’t exist or it doesn’t
mean anything, but the Holocaust was

367
00:12:13.324 --> 00:12:14.783
mean anything, but the Holocaust was
the greatest crime of the 20th

368
00:12:14.783 --> 00:12:16.866
the greatest crime of the 20th
century and we need to teach it in

369
00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:18.533
century and we need to teach it in
the schools and we need to

370
00:12:18.533 --> 00:12:20.866
the schools and we need to
understand it at every level that

371
00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:23.074
understand it at every level that
exists, just as we need to

372
00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:24.324
exists, just as we need to
understand the transatlantic slave

373
00:12:24.324 --> 00:12:27.533
understand the transatlantic slave
trade and its impact on people of

374
00:12:27.533 --> 00:12:27.699
trade and its impact on peopla of
African

375
00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:28.658
trade and its impact on people of
African descent today. We need to

376
00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:30.866
African descent today. We need to
understand the Holocaust and what it

377
00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:32.491
understand the Holocaust and what it
means to

378
00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:34.283
understand the Holocaust and what it
means toJewish people and to those

379
00:12:34.283 --> 00:12:35.491
means to jewish peopla and to those
of us who

380
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:35.908
means toJewish people and to those
of us who are not

381
00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:36.533
means toJewish people and to those
of us who are notJewish. And for

382
00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:38.408
of us who are not jewish. And for
the labour

383
00:12:38.408 --> 00:12:39.199
of us who are notJewish. And for
the Labour Party I cannot even

384
00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:39.574
the labour Party I cannot even
express how

385
00:12:39.574 --> 00:12:39.783
the labour Party I cannot even
express howl

386
00:12:39.783 --> 00:12:42.824
the Labour Party I cannot even
express how I feel, at the Labour

387
00:12:42.824 --> 00:12:43.908
express how I feel, at the labour
Party is taught

388
00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:45.491
express how I feel, at the Labour
Party is caught up in this. I am a

389
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:48.158
Party is caught up in this. I am a
labour voter and I will always vote

390
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:48.533
labour voter and I will always vote
labour, I

391
00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:49.574
labour voter and I will always vote
Labour, I became a citizen so I

392
00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:50.074
labour, I became a citizen so I
could vote

393
00:12:50.074 --> 00:12:51.741
Labour, I became a citizen so I
could vote Labour and I will always

394
00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:52.283
could vote labour and I will always
vote for

395
00:12:52.283 --> 00:12:53.324
could vote Labour and I will always
vote for the Labour Party because I

396
00:12:53.324 --> 00:12:54.199
vote for the labour Party because I
think it is

397
00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:55.824
vote for the Labour Party because I
think it is the best coalition of

398
00:12:55.824 --> 00:12:57.741
think it is the best coalition of
the left for this country. But for

399
00:12:57.741 --> 00:12:59.741
the left for this country. But for
this party to be caught up in

400
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:01.324
this party to be caught up in
something like this makes me sick

401
00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:03.283
something like this makes me sick
and I don’t want to hear it, I don’t

402
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.408
and I don’t want to hear it, I don’t
want to hear all the other stuff. It

403
00:13:06.408 --> 00:13:08.241
want to hear all the other stuff. It
needs to be dealt with immediately

404
00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:10.741
needs to be dealt with immediately
at the top with immediate due

405
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:12.283
at the top with immediate due
diligence. Whether

406
00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:12.783
at the top with immediate due
diligence. WhetherJeremy is an

407
00:13:12.783 --> 00:13:14.074
diligence. WhetherJeremy is an
anti—Semite or what, how would I

408
00:13:14.074 --> 00:13:14.283
anti-Semite or what, how would I
know

409
00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:17.658
anti—Semite or what, how would I
know that? He doesn’t seem like one

410
00:13:17.658 --> 00:13:20.991
know that? He doesn’t seem like one
to me, but how would I know? The

411
00:13:20.991 --> 00:13:21.449
to me, but how would I know? The
peopla who

412
00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:22.283
to me, but how would I know? The
people who know other people who

413
00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:22.908
peopla who know other peopla who
feel it

414
00:13:22.908 --> 00:13:24.324
people who know other people who
feel it and that is who we should be

415
00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:30.366
feel it and that is who we should be
listening to. Marie. It has been an

416
00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:32.408
listening to. Marie. It has been an
incredibly painful day, it is a

417
00:13:32.408 --> 00:13:33.949
incredibly painful day, it is a
damning incitement of labour. This

418
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:36.991
damning incitement of labour. This
is really serious. The report has

419
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:40.283
is really serious. The report has
found that the Labour Party has

420
00:13:40.283 --> 00:13:42.366
found that the Labour Party has
committed unlawful acts of

421
00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:45.533
committed unlawful acts of
harassment and victimisation against

422
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:45.741
harassment and victimisation against
jewish

423
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:47.283
harassment and victimisation against
Jewish people. It does not get any

424
00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:47.449
jewish peopla. It does not get any
worse

425
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:50.908
Jewish people. It does not get any
worse than that, does it? And we

426
00:13:50.908 --> 00:13:52.741
worse than that, does it? And we
felt during this time people were

427
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:55.658
felt during this time people were
making allegations that raising

428
00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:58.283
making allegations that raising
this, as Bonnie said, were smears,

429
00:13:58.283 --> 00:14:02.074
this, as Bonnie said, were smears,
some kind of deliberate action. And

430
00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:02.783
some kind of deliberate action. And
the jewish

431
00:14:02.783 --> 00:14:04.199
some kind of deliberate action. And
theJewish community did not want

432
00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:04.824
the jewish community did not want
this fight, but

433
00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:05.866
theJewish community did not want
this fight, but we had to stand up,

434
00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.783
this fight, but we had to stand up,
we had to say this was wrong and we

435
00:14:07.783 --> 00:14:11.991
we had to say this was wrong and we
were proud to do that. And today is

436
00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:13.824
were proud to do that. And today is
a damning indictment, as I have

437
00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:16.783
a damning indictment, as I have
said. What has happened during the

438
00:14:16.783 --> 00:14:17.408
said. what has happened during the
course of

439
00:14:17.408 --> 00:14:20.283
said. What has happened during the
course of the last few years is that

440
00:14:20.283 --> 00:14:22.033
course of the last few years is that
anti—Semitism was on the fringes of

441
00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:22.991
anti-Semitism was on the fringes of
society and it

442
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:23.658
anti—Semitism was on the fringes of
society and it has been brought

443
00:14:23.658 --> 00:14:25.491
society and it has been brought
straight into mainstream politics

444
00:14:25.491 --> 00:14:25.824
straight into mainstream politic
into

445
00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:29.908
straight into mainstream politics
into the political party. Jeremy

446
00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:30.449
into the political party. jeremy
Corbyn and

447
00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:31.324
into the political party. Jeremy
Corbyn and his leadership made a

448
00:14:31.324 --> 00:14:35.991
Corbyn and his leadership made a
political decision to ignore, not to

449
00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:36.199
political decision to ignore, not to
tackla,

450
00:14:36.199 --> 00:14:39.658
political decision to ignore, not to
tackle, anti—Semitism. That is so

451
00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:40.241
tackla, anti-Semitism. That is so
appalling, it is

452
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:43.824
tackle, anti—Semitism. That is so
appalling, it is not imaginable in

453
00:14:43.824 --> 00:14:44.408
appalling, it is not imaginabla in
this day and

454
00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:45.199
appalling, it is not imaginable in
this day and age. The leadership did

455
00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:49.491
this day and age. The leadership did
nothing about it and here we are

456
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:50.991
nothing about it and here we are
today talking all these years later

457
00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:53.908
today talking all these years later
when this could have been resolved.

458
00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:55.574
when this could have been resolved.
And not only did the leadership of

459
00:14:55.574 --> 00:14:58.991
And not only did the leadership of
the party not do anything about it,

460
00:14:58.991 --> 00:15:00.658
the party not do anything about it,
we have now got findings of

461
00:15:00.658 --> 00:15:02.658
we have now got findings of
interference, political interference

462
00:15:02.658 --> 00:15:05.699
interference, political interference
by the leader’s office. It does not

463
00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:09.783
by the leader’s office. It does not
get much worse than that, does it?

464
00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:10.741
get much worse than that, does it?
(“an I ask you,

465
00:15:10.741 --> 00:15:11.741
get much worse than that, does it?
Can I ask you, Jeremy Corbyn has

466
00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:12.324
(“an I ask you, jeremy Corbyn has
said again

467
00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:14.116
Can I ask you, Jeremy Corbyn has
said again today that he was not

468
00:15:14.116 --> 00:15:15.741
said again today that he was not
anti—Semitic and anybody who says

469
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:16.074
anti-Semitic and anybody who says
there

470
00:15:16.074 --> 00:15:17.324
anti—Semitic and anybody who says
there was not a problem with

471
00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:18.991
there was not a problem with
anti—Semitism in labour it was

472
00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:20.283
anti-Semitism in labour it was
wrong. But

473
00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:21.116
anti—Semitism in labour it was
wrong. But the question is should

474
00:15:21.116 --> 00:15:22.283
wrong. But the question is should
just one individual be held to

475
00:15:22.283 --> 00:15:26.366
just one individual be held to
account? It is a question of the

476
00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.824
account? It is a question of the
culture in the party. The problem

477
00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:30.199
culture in the party. The problem
with anti—Semitism runs deep. This

478
00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:31.283
with anti-Semitism runs deep. This
is going to be

479
00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:33.408
with anti—Semitism runs deep. This
is going to be the beginning of a

480
00:15:33.408 --> 00:15:33.991
is going to be the beginning of a
very long journey.

481
00:15:33.991 --> 00:15:34.783
is going to be the beginning of a
very longjourney. It

482
00:15:34.783 --> 00:15:35.491
is going to be the beginning of a
very long journey. It is all very

483
00:15:35.491 --> 00:15:37.033
very long journey. It is all very
well the Labour Party saying sorry

484
00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:37.491
well the labour Party saying sorry
and Keir

485
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:38.866
well the Labour Party saying sorry
and Keir Starmer did give an apology

486
00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:41.908
and Keir Starmer did give an apology
on the day he was elected, but what

487
00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:43.449
on the day he was elected, but what
is important here is that we see

488
00:15:43.449 --> 00:15:47.033
is important here is that we see
action. Words are only so much, we

489
00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:50.241
action. Words are only so much, we
need to see that the action plan is

490
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.241
need to see that the action plan is
implemented by the 10th of December

491
00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:55.283
implemented by the 10th of December
and there need to be key changes

492
00:15:55.283 --> 00:15:59.033
and there need to be key changes
across the party. We need an

493
00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:00.199
across the party. We need an
independent disciplinary process,

494
00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:02.241
independent disciplinary process,
education, and to tackle that

495
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:02.324
education, and to tackla that
culture.

496
00:16:02.324 --> 00:16:04.199
education, and to tackle that
culture. And this is going to be

497
00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:06.283
culture. And this is going to be
something that is not going to

498
00:16:06.283 --> 00:16:07.949
something that is not going to
change overnight. There is a lot of

499
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:11.783
change overnight. There is a lot of
pain and a lot of hurt. It is not

500
00:16:11.783 --> 00:16:13.116
pain and a lot of hurt. It is not
one person’s fault but

501
00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:14.658
pain and a lot of hurt. It is not
one person’s fault butJeremy Corbyn

502
00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:14.783
one person’s fault butjeremy Corbyn
allowed

503
00:16:14.783 --> 00:16:15.866
one person’s fault butJeremy Corbyn
allowed the space for anti—Semites

504
00:16:15.866 --> 00:16:16.533
allowed the space for anti-Semites
to come

505
00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:18.074
allowed the space for anti—Semites
to come into the party and the

506
00:16:18.074 --> 00:16:19.324
to come into the party and the
leadership did absolutely nothing

507
00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:23.199
leadership did absolutely nothing
about it. Let’s hear

508
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:23.616
leadership did absolutely nothing
about it. Let’s hearfrom our

509
00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:23.741
about it. Let’s hear from our
audience.

510
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:27.741
about it. Let’s hearfrom our
audience. Jane. Hello, like

511
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:28.199
audience. jane. Hello, like
everybody I

512
00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:29.033
audience. Jane. Hello, like
everybody I have been horrified by

513
00:16:29.033 --> 00:16:34.741
everybody I have been horrified by
this story. We had today that the

514
00:16:34.741 --> 00:16:35.158
this story. We had today that the
labour Party

515
00:16:35.158 --> 00:16:37.408
this story. We had today that the
Labour Party are accountable, but

516
00:16:37.408 --> 00:16:37.949
labour Party are accountabla, but
really they are

517
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:42.699
Labour Party are accountable, but
really they are an entity and surely

518
00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:45.033
really they are an entity and surely
there must be some individuals to be

519
00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:46.116
there must be some individuals to be
held accountable. Are there any

520
00:16:46.116 --> 00:16:49.158
held accountable. Are there any
legal redress is that will ensure

521
00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:50.783
legal redress is that will ensure
that the people behind this are

522
00:16:50.783 --> 00:16:50.991
that the peopla behind this are
found

523
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:54.449
that the people behind this are
found accountable? It is one thing

524
00:16:54.449 --> 00:16:56.033
found accountable? It is one thing
being expelled from your political

525
00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:56.241
being expelled from your political
Party.

526
00:16:56.241 --> 00:17:00.241
being expelled from your political
party, but to me that is not enough

527
00:17:00.241 --> 00:17:01.783
party, but to me that is not enough
for the situation that has happened.

528
00:17:01.783 --> 00:17:05.991
for the situation that has happened.
To drag hate crime into politics is

529
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:06.491
To drag hate crime into politic is
a pretty

530
00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:09.283
To drag hate crime into politics is
a pretty serious thing and so

531
00:17:09.283 --> 00:17:12.783
a pretty serious thing and so
against the British way of life.

532
00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:16.741
against the British way of life.
Paula? I want to come back on Nick’s

533
00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:20.324
Paula? I want to come back on Nick’s
point when he said don’t

534
00:17:20.324 --> 00:17:21.241
Paula? I want to come back on Nick’s
point when he said don’tjudge my

535
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:22.449
point when he said don’t judge my
words, judged

536
00:17:22.449 --> 00:17:22.991
point when he said don’tjudge my
words, judged by actions. Prejudice

537
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:23.991
words, judged byactions. Prejudice
is displayed

538
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:24.908
words, judged by actions. Prejudice
is displayed through words and words

539
00:17:24.908 --> 00:17:27.491
is displayed through words and words
do matter. I want to come back to

540
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:29.616
do matter. I want to come back to
Chris because he has very quickly

541
00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.283
Chris because he has very quickly
gone in and criticised Keir Starmer,

542
00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.699
gone in and criticised Keir Starmer,
but I would remind him that the

543
00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:34.366
but I would remind him that the
Conservative Party has also been

544
00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:37.491
Conservative Party has also been
accused of racism against people of

545
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:37.616
accused of racism against peopla of
Islamic

546
00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:40.283
accused of racism against people of
Islamic faith, so when people look

547
00:17:40.283 --> 00:17:40.741
Islamic faith, so when peopla look
forward

548
00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:41.658
Islamic faith, so when people look
forward to an investigation into

549
00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:44.824
forward to an investigation into
their practices and see some

550
00:17:44.824 --> 00:17:48.283
their practices and see some
apologies from them. We are still

551
00:17:48.283 --> 00:17:50.033
apologies from them. We are still
waiting for a report from the

going to say the Tories do need to

606
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:28.574
going to say the Tories do need to
acknowledge there is a problem with

they do acknowledge the need to do
something about it. The Board of

something about it. The Board of
deputies did input into the report,

611
00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:40.283
deputies did input into the report,
but we need to look at scale. The

but we need to look at scale. The
BNP have also been investigated by

613
00:19:46.866 --> 00:19:48.783
BNP have also been investigated by
the EHRC, but so many people in the

the EHRC, but so many peopla in the
labour Party

615
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:50.449
the EHRC, but so many people in the
Labour Party have been investigated.

616
00:19:50.449 --> 00:19:50.866
labour Party have been investigated.
You are

617
00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:52.158
Labour Party have been investigated.
You are not seeing from the

618
00:19:52.158 --> 00:19:53.408
You are not seeing from the
Conservative Party MPs fleeing from

619
00:19:53.408 --> 00:19:56.658
Conservative Party MPs ﬂeeing from
the party,

620
00:19:56.658 --> 00:19:58.533
Conservative Party MPs fleeing from
the party, Leica pregnant women and

00:19:58.533 --> 00:19:58.949
the party, Leira pregnant women and
the labour

622
00:19:58.949 --> 00:20:00.783
the party, Leica pregnant women and
the Labour Party conference, and she

623
00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.033
the labour Party conference, and she
even had

624
00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:02.866
the Labour Party conference, and she
even had to have security. Louise

625
00:20:02.866 --> 00:20:05.366
even had to have security. Louise
Ullman, who had to flee the party

626

Ullman, who had to ﬂee the party
after 55 years,

627
00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:07.574
Ullman, who had to flee the party
after 55 years, so you are not

628
00:20:07.574 --> 00:20:11.366

seeing the same level of scale even

629
00:20:11.366 --> 00:20:14.116
seeing the same level of scale even
though issues to be addressed in the

630
00:20:14.116 --> 00:20:15.199
though issues to be addressed in the
Conservative Party. How is this

631
00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.866
Conservative Party. How is this
looking to you on the other side of

632
00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:20.324
looking to you on the other side of
the Atlantic, to bring you an here?

I’m going to say thank God —— not

634
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:23.408
I’m going to say thank God -- not
going to say

I’m going to say thank God —— not
going to say thank God I’m not

going to say thank God I’m not
involved in British politics, I have

637
00:20:25.699 --> 00:20:26.116
involved in British politic, I have
my own

638
00:20:26.116 --> 00:20:27.783
involved in British politics, I have
my own problems on the side of the

639
00:20:27.783 --> 00:20:28.949
my own problems on the side of the
pond. And I mean this very

640
00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:30.991
pond. And I mean this very
respectfully to Chris, but this is

641
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:34.116
respectfully to Chris, but this is
what I would say. I am relating what

642
00:20:34.116 --> 00:20:35.741
what I would say. I am relating what
Bonnie is saying about tokenism, and

643
00:20:35.741 --> 00:20:38.324
Bonnie is saying about tokenism, and
I think what we find in our society,

644
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:42.241
I think what we find in our society,
we have to break down the systemic

645
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.533
we have to break down the systemic
and institutional racism. If the

646
00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.449
and institutional racism. If the
racists think you are a racist,

647
00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:48.199
racists think you are a racist,
guess what, you are a racist. If

648
00:20:48.199 --> 00:20:50.199
guess what, you are a racist. If
anti—Semites think you are an

649
00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:51.366
anti—Semites think you are an
anti—Semite, you likely are an

650
00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.616
anti—Semite, you likely are an
anti—Semite, and even if you are not

651
00:20:53.616 --> 00:20:54.449
anti-Semite, and even if you are not
doing it

652
00:20:54.449 --> 00:20:55.408
anti—Semite, and even if you are not
doing it intentionally there are

653
00:20:55.408 --> 00:20:56.824
doing it intentionally there are
systemic and institutional biases

654
00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:59.074
systemic and institutional biases
and I think Bonnie’s point, which I

655
00:20:59.074 --> 00:21:01.991
and I think Bonnie’s point, which I
would like to hammer, you can’t say,

656
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:02.949
would like to hammer, you can’t say,
"Oneof my best

657
00:21:02.949 --> 00:21:03.741
would like to hammer, you can’t say,
"OneOf my best friends is black and

658
00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:05.574
"OneOf my best friends is black and
therefore I am not a racist"

659
00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:06.199
"OneOf my best friends is black and
therefore I am not a racist", you

660
00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:09.074
therefore I am not a racist", you
just can’t do that, it is tokenism.

661
00:21:09.074 --> 00:21:11.324
just can’t do that, it is tokenism.
We have to do what Doctor Martin

662
00:21:11.324 --> 00:21:12.366
We have to do what Doctor Martin
Luther King Junior said a

663
00:21:12.366 --> 00:21:12.574
We have to do what Doctor Martin
Luther King Junior said along

664
00:21:12.574 --> 00:21:12.741
We have to do what Doctor Martin
Luther King Junior said a long time

665
00:21:12.741 --> 00:21:13.158
Luther King junior said a long time
ago, judge

666
00:21:13.158 --> 00:21:14.658
Luther King Junior said a long time
ago, judge each other by the content

667
00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:16.283
ago, judge each other by the content
of our character and not the colour

668
00:21:16.283 --> 00:21:17.908
of our character and not the colour
of her skin. Either way,

669
00:21:17.908 --> 00:21:18.991
of our character and not the colour
of herskin. Eitherway, I

670
00:21:18.991 --> 00:21:19.866
of our character and not the colour
of her skin. Either way, I grew up

671
00:21:19.866 --> 00:21:21.199
of her skin. Either way, I grew up
in a very patriarchal Italian

672
00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:24.116
in a very patriarchal Italian
American immigrant family, so you

673
00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.783
American immigrant family, so you
are also biased by the way you grew

674
00:21:25.783 --> 00:21:29.866
are also biased by the way you grew
up. It is important for you to seek

675
00:21:29.866 --> 00:21:31.366
up. It is important for you to seek
that enlightenment and make that

676
00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:33.116
that enlightenment and make that
transformation, and we need to do it

677
00:21:33.116 --> 00:21:35.824
transformation, and we need to do it
as a culture and civilisation. It

678
00:21:35.824 --> 00:21:37.783
as a culture and civilisation. It
has to be at the institutional

679
00:21:37.783 --> 00:21:38.158
has to be at the institutional
lavel. It

680
00:21:38.158 --> 00:21:42.449
has to be at the institutional
level. It has to be at the Labour

681
00:21:42.449 --> 00:21:42.658
lavel. It has to be at the labour
and

682
00:21:42.658 --> 00:21:44.074
level. It has to be at the Labour
and Conservative level, frankly.

683
00:21:44.074 --> 00:21:45.241
and Conservative level, frankly.

00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:15.074
That’s what people in the streets
are about now. It doesn’t matter.

700

It’s what you do, and if you pursue

701
00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:22.199
It’s what you do, and if you pursue
policies and stay the same way, you

702
00:22:22.199 --> 00:22:23.366
policies and stay the same way, you
could have whatever. It don’t

get it inside. She means it

get it inside. She means it
respectfully, too, and I want to get

respectfully, too, and I want to get
that in. I don’t know if I do... She

that in. I don’t know if I do... She
is giving you the benefit of the

709
00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:38.866
is giving you the benefit of the
doubt. You’re not racist. She is

710
00:22:38.866 --> 00:22:42.449
doubt. You’re not racist. She is
trying to tell you you’re in a web,

711
00:22:42.449 --> 00:22:44.824
trying to tell you you’re in a web,
and you need to see things the way

712
00:22:44.824 --> 00:22:46.408
and you need to see things the way
minority see them. My point was my

713
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:47.783
minority see them. My point was my
colleagues in Government are not

714
00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:49.158
colleagues in Government are not
there for reasons of tokenism but

715
00:22:49.158 --> 00:22:51.741
there for reasons of tokenism but
they are there because they are

716
00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:52.616
they are there because they are
incredibly talented, hard—working,

717
00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:52.991
incredibly talented, hard-working,
energetic and

718
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:54.158
incredibly talented, hard—working,
energetic and dynamic people and of

719
00:22:54.158 --> 00:22:56.116
energetic and dynamic people and of
course I understand we have to

720
00:22:56.116 --> 00:22:58.199
course I understand we have to
dismantle any barriers to anyone

721
00:22:58.199 --> 00:22:59.366
dismantle any barriers to anyone
achieving their potential because,

722
00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:01.908
achieving their potential because,
in the words of Martin Luther King

723
00:23:01.908 --> 00:23:02.408
in the words of Martin Luther King
junior, who

724
00:23:02.408 --> 00:23:03.491
in the words of Martin Luther King
Junior, who Anthony quoted a go,

725
00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:03.658
junior, who Anthony quoted a go,
what

726
00:23:03.658 --> 00:23:05.533
Junior, who Anthony quoted a go,
what matters is the content of

727
00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:06.074
what matters is the content of
someone’s

728
00:23:06.074 --> 00:23:07.324
what matters is the content of
someone’s character, their ability

729
00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:10.533
someone’s character, their ability
and talent. I never used the word

730
00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:14.074
and talent. I never used the word
token. You did. You used it twice.

731
00:23:14.074 --> 00:23:16.741
token. You did. You used it twice.
Someone did. He did. It wasn’t me. I

732
00:23:16.741 --> 00:23:18.741
Someone did. He did. It wasn’t me. I
think we need to concentrate a bit

733
00:23:18.741 --> 00:23:20.616
think we need to concentrate a bit
more on the Labour Party

734
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:21.699
more on the Labour Party
anti—Semitism because when you look

735
00:23:21.699 --> 00:23:22.241
anti-Semitism because when you look
at what jeremy

736
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:23.574
anti—Semitism because when you look
at whatJeremy Corbyn did this

737
00:23:23.574 --> 00:23:24.116
at whatjeremy Corbyn did this
morning in

738
00:23:24.116 --> 00:23:25.574
at whatJeremy Corbyn did this
morning in his speech he totally

739
00:23:25.574 --> 00:23:27.158
morning in his speech he totally
tried to say it wasn’t so important.

740
00:23:27.158 --> 00:23:30.074
tried to say it wasn’t so important.
We even tried to suggest he had made

741
00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:32.199
We even tried to suggest he had made
improvements, and he is someone who

742
00:23:32.199 --> 00:23:33.699
improvements, and he is someone who
has to accept responsibility, and I

743
00:23:33.699 --> 00:23:35.324
has to accept responsibility, and I
think the lessons from the Labour

744
00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:35.824
think the lassons from the labour
Party are what

745
00:23:35.824 --> 00:23:37.574
think the lessons from the Labour
Party are what we should be really

746
00:23:37.574 --> 00:23:39.491
Party are what we should be really
focusing on today. Let’s hear more

747
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:42.741
focusing on today. Let’s hear more
from our audience. Lots of hands up.

748
00:23:42.741 --> 00:23:44.616
from our audience. Lots of hands up.
Going back to the culture of the

749
00:23:44.616 --> 00:23:44.908
Going back to the culture of the
labour Party,

750
00:23:44.908 --> 00:23:46.533
Going back to the culture of the
Labour Party, I think since the

751
00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:46.658
labour Party, I think since the
appointment

752
00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:47.866
Labour Party, I think since the
appointment of Keir Starmer I think

753
00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:50.116
appointment of Keir Starmer I think
he really has stamped a clear

754
00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:52.283
he really has stamped a clear
message regarding it. OK, yes, we

755
00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:54.491
message regarding it. OK, yes, we
can’t turn back what has happened,

756
00:23:54.491 --> 00:24:00.199
can’t turn back what has happened,
but hopefully... With the message he

757
00:24:00.199 --> 00:24:01.699
but hopefully... with the message he
has sent out,

758
00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:02.866
but hopefully... With the message he
has sent out, and we just saw some

759
00:24:02.866 --> 00:24:03.699
has sent out, and we just saw some
of Rebeca

760
00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:04.783
has sent out, and we just saw some
of Rebecca Long—Bailey, early doors,

761
00:24:04.783 --> 00:24:05.366
of Rebeca Long-Bailay, earty doors,
I think

762
00:24:05.366 --> 00:24:07.574
of Rebecca Long—Bailey, early doors,
I think that hopefully sends a clear

763
00:24:07.574 --> 00:24:11.908
I think that hopefully sends a clear
message going forward. Alex? Is a

764
00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:13.866
message going forward. Alex? Is a
young person brought up and talked

765
00:24:13.866 --> 00:24:15.408
young person brought up and talked
about the horrors of the Holocaust

766
00:24:15.408 --> 00:24:16.449
about the horrors of the Holocaust
-- as a young

767
00:24:16.449 --> 00:24:17.574
about the horrors of the Holocaust
—— as a young person. I feel it is

768
00:24:17.574 --> 00:24:17.783
-- as a young person. I feel it is
absolutely

769
00:24:17.783 --> 00:24:18.616
—— as a young person. I feel it is
absolutely ludicrous things like

770
00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:20.199
absolutely ludicrous things like
this are still happening in today’s

771
00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:20.616
this are still happening in todars
politic and

772
00:24:20.616 --> 00:24:23.158
this are still happening in today’s
politics and people need to be held

773
00:24:23.158 --> 00:24:25.616
politics and people need to be held
accountable. I agree. Absolutely.

774
00:24:25.616 --> 00:24:25.991
accountabla. Iagree. Absolutely.
You

775
00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:28.116
accountable. I agree. Absolutely.
You don’t expect anti—Semitism in

776
00:24:28.116 --> 00:24:28.491
You don’t expect anti-Semitism in
the opposition

777
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:30.241
You don’t expect anti—Semitism in
the opposition party. It is

778
00:24:30.241 --> 00:24:32.199
the opposition party. It is
unimaginable, let alone being found

779
00:24:32.199 --> 00:24:34.616
unimaginable, let alone being found
guilty of victimisation and

780
00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:36.949
guilty of victimisation and
harassment. Miles? Good evening. I

781
00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:38.741
harassment. Miles? Good evening. I
think it’s a terrible shame to see

782
00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:40.783
think it’s a terrible shame to see
what the Labour Party did, but as

783
00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:41.158
what the labour Party did, but as
MP5 how

784
00:24:41.158 --> 00:24:42.574
what the Labour Party did, but as
MP5 how are we going to change that

785
00:24:42.574 --> 00:24:45.158
MPs how are we going to change that
in future so there is no hate crime

786
00:24:45.158 --> 00:24:47.158
in future so there is no hate crime
in any political party anywhere, and

787
00:24:47.158 --> 00:24:48.741
in any political party anywhere, and
for anybody who does work for the

788
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:50.366
for anybody who does work for the
Government, who wants to become a

789
00:24:50.366 --> 00:24:52.158
Government, who wants to become a
Member of Parliament, they know they

790
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:53.741
Member of Partiament, they know they
are safe

791
00:24:53.741 --> 00:24:54.616
Member of Parliament, they know they
are safe where they are working?

792
00:24:54.616 --> 00:24:56.783
are safe where they are working?
Let’s have a final word from you.

793
00:24:56.783 --> 00:24:58.783
Let’s have a final word from you.
One question was about, is any legal

794
00:24:58.783 --> 00:25:02.324
One question was about, is any legal
action going to be taken against

795
00:25:02.324 --> 00:25:04.949
action going to be taken against
anyone in the Labour Party? How are

796
00:25:04.949 --> 00:25:05.533
anyone in the labour Party? How are
you going to

797
00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:06.074
anyone in the Labour Party? How are
you going to change the culture

798
00:25:06.074 --> 00:25:09.241
you going to change the culture
within the party from here on in?

799
00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:10.116
within the party from here on in?
Firstly, since Keir Starmer became

800
00:25:10.116 --> 00:25:14.741
Firstly, since Keir Starmer became
the leader I think it is nearly up

801
00:25:14.741 --> 00:25:15.324
the leader I think it is nearty up
to about

802
00:25:15.324 --> 00:25:18.033
the leader I think it is nearly up
to about 300 cases dealt with in our

803
00:25:18.033 --> 00:25:19.408
to about 300 cases dealt with in our
complaints system. That, just to

804
00:25:19.408 --> 00:25:22.866
complaints system. That, just to
give a sense, it is more than in the

805
00:25:22.866 --> 00:25:25.616
give a sense, it is more than in the
whole of 2019. Clearly Keir has been

806
00:25:25.616 --> 00:25:26.199
whole of 2019. Cleariy Keir has been
trying to make

807
00:25:26.199 --> 00:25:26.533
whole of 2019. Clearly Keir has been
trying to make progress on

808
00:25:26.533 --> 00:25:28.741
trying to make progress on
individuals held to account since he

809
00:25:28.741 --> 00:25:31.033
individuals held to account since he
became leader. But asking very

810
00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:32.408
became leader. But asking very
specifically, any prospect of legal

811
00:25:32.408 --> 00:25:34.033
specifically, any prospect of legal
action being taken against anyone in

812
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:36.199
action being taken against anyone in
the party, given the report out

813
00:25:36.199 --> 00:25:39.199
the party, given the report out
today? Well, look, I can’t comment

814
00:25:39.199 --> 00:25:40.949
today? Well, look, I can’t comment
on whether individuals want to take

815
00:25:40.949 --> 00:25:42.824
on whether individuals want to take
legal action on particular bits of

816
00:25:42.824 --> 00:25:44.908
legal action on particular bits of
the report, but obviously, number

817
00:25:44.908 --> 00:25:45.574
the report, but obviously, number
one, I

818
00:25:45.574 --> 00:25:45.741
the report, but obviously, number
one, Isay

819
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:47.199
the report, but obviously, number
one, I say we will of course be

820
00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:49.033
one, I say we will of course be
holding people to account. That’s

821
00:25:49.033 --> 00:25:50.908
holding peopla to account. That’s
why we are

822
00:25:50.908 --> 00:25:53.158
holding people to account. That’s
why we are going to improve our

823
00:25:53.158 --> 00:25:54.491
why we are going to improve our
complaints system, and Marie asked

824
00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:55.033
complaints system, and Marie asked
me very fairty

825
00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:56.574
complaints system, and Marie asked
me very fairly about how we will do

826
00:25:56.574 --> 00:25:56.991
me very fairty about how we will do
that going

827
00:25:56.991 --> 00:25:58.033
me very fairly about how we will do
that going forward. We have to put

828
00:25:58.033 --> 00:26:01.033
that going forward. We have to put
an action plan together now by the

829
00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:02.699
an action plan together now by the
10th of December. We will be

830
00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:04.783
10th of December. We will be
reaching out, and Marie knows this,

831
00:26:04.783 --> 00:26:06.824
reaching out, and Marie knows this,
to the board of deputies, the

832
00:26:06.824 --> 00:26:07.033
reaching out, and Marie knows this,
to the board of deputies, theJewish

833
00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:07.699
to the board of deputies, the jewish
labour

834
00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:08.449
to the board of deputies, theJewish
labour movement and the wider

835
00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:08.783
to the board of deputies, theJewish
labour movement and the widerJewish

836
00:26:08.783 --> 00:26:09.324
labour movement and the widerjewish
community as

837
00:26:09.324 --> 00:26:10.533
labour movement and the widerJewish
community as we do that, to make

838
00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:13.533
community as we do that, to make
sure we do have a system and there

839
00:26:13.533 --> 00:26:15.741
sure we do have a system and there
is no political interference, that

840
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:16.533
is no political interference, that
it is property

841
00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:17.449
is no political interference, that
it is properly resourced and people

842
00:26:17.449 --> 00:26:18.533
it is property resourced and people
are property

843
00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:19.408
it is properly resourced and people
are properly trained, it is

844
00:26:19.408 --> 00:26:20.741
are properly trained, it is
transparent, that it has proper

845
00:26:20.741 --> 00:26:20.991
transparent, that it has proper
mles

846
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:22.533
transparent, that it has proper
rules about what sanctions are

847
00:26:22.533 --> 00:26:22.741
mles about what sanctions are
appropriate

848
00:26:22.741 --> 00:26:24.366
rules about what sanctions are
appropriate so everyone can have

849
00:26:24.366 --> 00:26:27.533
appropriate so everyone can have
confidence in it, but as I say there

850
00:26:27.533 --> 00:26:28.741
confidence in it, but as I say there
is a wider question here. That

851
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:29.991
is a wider question here. That
process is vitally important and we

852
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:32.741
process is vitally important and we
will put it in place but there is a

853
00:26:32.741 --> 00:26:34.324
will put it in place but there is a
fair challenge, too, about changing

854
00:26:34.324 --> 00:26:34.949
fair challange, too, about changing
the culture,

855
00:26:34.949 --> 00:26:37.408
fair challenge, too, about changing
the culture, and we change the

856
00:26:37.408 --> 00:26:38.533
the culture, and we change the
culture through leadership. We

857
00:26:38.533 --> 00:26:40.158
culture through leadership. We
change it through leadership by what

858
00:26:40.158 --> 00:26:41.408
change it through leadership by what
Keir Starmer has been staying and

859
00:26:41.408 --> 00:26:44.699
Keir Starmer has been staying and
doing over the past six months. One

860
00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:47.241
doing over the past six months. One
of the reasons I backed Keir

861
00:26:47.241 --> 00:26:47.658
doing over the past six months. One
of the reasons I backed Keirfour

862
00:26:47.658 --> 00:26:47.741
of the reasons I backed Keir four
leader

863
00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:48.991
of the reasons I backed Keirfour
leader while those conversations I

864
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.908
leader while those conversations I
had with him about his determination

865
00:26:50.908 --> 00:26:51.616
had with him about his determination
to tackla

866
00:26:51.616 --> 00:26:53.324
had with him about his determination
to tackle this issue —— for leader.

867
00:26:53.324 --> 00:26:53.908
to tackle this issue -- for leader.
He set that

868
00:26:53.908 --> 00:26:55.658
to tackle this issue —— for leader.
He set that out and made it a policy

869
00:26:55.658 --> 00:26:56.866
He set that out and made it a policy
in his acceptance speech back in

870
00:26:56.866 --> 00:26:57.699
in his acceptance speech back in
April and

871
00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:57.866
in his acceptance speech hack in
April and he

872
00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:58.699
in his acceptance speech back in
April and he has been putting that

873
00:26:58.699 --> 00:27:00.491
April and he has been putting that
into action since and it is that

874
00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:01.866
into action since and it is that
leadership that will be vital to

875
00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:04.699
leadership that will be vital to
bring about that cultural change we

876
00:27:04.699 --> 00:27:06.574
bring about that cultural change we
need. Maria is absolutely right to

877
00:27:06.574 --> 00:27:06.741
need. Maria is absolutely right to
55V

878
00:27:06.741 --> 00:27:08.408
need. Maria is absolutely right to
say it won’t happen overnight but we

879
00:27:08.408 --> 00:27:10.324
say it won’t happen overnight but we
are determined to make it happen and

880
00:27:10.324 --> 00:27:12.116
are determined to make it happen and
work at it. I will take another

881
00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:14.199
work at it. I will take another
question in a moment, but before we

882
00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.033
question in a moment, but before we
do that I want to say we are looking

883
00:27:16.033 --> 00:27:17.991
do that I want to say we are looking
for peopla to

884
00:27:17.991 --> 00:27:18.199
do that I want to say we are looking
for people tojoin

885
00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:18.824
do that I want to say we are looking
for people to join our virtual

891
00:27:24.824 --> 00:27:26.324
south—east London, virtually of
course. The week after we are in

892
00:27:26.324 --> 00:27:28.241

Dover. If you live in either of
those two places or they’re about to

894
00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:31.574
those two places or therre about to
get in touch on

895

be part of it. Right, let’s take our

901
00:27:41.908 --> 00:27:47.824
be part of it. Right, let’s take our
second question now, from Helen.

902
00:27:56.991 --> 00:27:59.908
Given the global importance
of the USA, should people in the UK

903
00:27:59.908 --> 00:28:02.991
be concerned that the real choice
Americans appear to have is to vote

904
00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:05.158
for who they consider
is the least worst candidate

905
00:28:05.158 --> 00:28:06.408
for the role of President?

906
00:28:06.574 --> 00:28:07.366
, white and I will

907
00:28:07.366 --> 00:28:07.783
,white and I will come to

908
00:28:07.783 --> 00:28:11.033
, white and I will come to you
first. --

909
00:28:11.033 --> 00:28:13.033
, white and I will come to you
first. —— Anthony, country first.

910
00:28:13.033 --> 00:28:13.241
first. -- Anthony, country first.
What

911
00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:13.574
first. -- Anthony, country first.
what is your

912
00:28:13.574 --> 00:28:15.824
first. —— Anthony, country first.
What is your view? We get two

913
00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:16.241
what is your view? We get two
choices --

914
00:28:16.241 --> 00:28:18.658
What is your view? We get two
choices —— I will come to you first.

915
00:28:18.658 --> 00:28:19.574
choices -- I will come to you first.
To my choices,

916
00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:20.324
choices —— I will come to you first.
To my choices, some of it a

917
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:21.491
To my choices, some of it a
calibration exactly of what she is

918
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:23.658
calibration exactly of what she is
saying and I agree it is the least

919
00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:26.658
saying and I agree it is the least
of the two evils, if you will. But

920
00:28:26.658 --> 00:28:29.366
of the two evils, if you will. But
it is totally different this time.

921
00:28:29.366 --> 00:28:32.616
it is totally different this time.
We have one person threatening the

922
00:28:32.616 --> 00:28:34.533
We have one person threatening the
system, 24A—year—old system known as

923
00:28:34.533 --> 00:28:34.741
system, 2M-year-old system known as
the

924
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:35.866
system, 24A—year—old system known as
the American experiment. We have one

925
00:28:35.866 --> 00:28:38.366
the American experiment. We have one
person who wants to take away

926
00:28:38.366 --> 00:28:40.991
person who wants to take away
polling stations, remove mail

927
00:28:40.991 --> 00:28:43.366
polling stations, remove mail
sorting machines, remove post office

928
00:28:43.366 --> 00:28:45.408
sorting machines, remove post office
boxes, and the rhetoric coming from

929
00:28:45.408 --> 00:28:48.533
boxes, and the rhetoric coming from
that person is a disaster for the

930
00:28:48.533 --> 00:28:50.033
that person is a disaster for the
United States. The president of the

931
00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:51.866
United States. The president of the
United States is suggesting he may

932
00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:54.449
United States is suggesting he may
or may not accept a peaceful

933
00:28:54.449 --> 00:28:57.116
or may not accept a peaceful
transfer of power, and so I call on

934
00:28:57.116 --> 00:28:58.199
transfer of power, and so I all on
all patriots in

935
00:28:58.199 --> 00:28:59.033
transfer of power, and so I call on
all patriots in the United States to

936
00:28:59.033 --> 00:29:01.241
all patriots in the United States to
put aside their partisan ship and

937
00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:02.658
put aside their partisan ship and
seek a higher order which is

938
00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:05.658
seek a higher order which is
patriotism and look at that. When

939
00:29:05.658 --> 00:29:06.074
patriotism and look at that. when
you compare

940
00:29:06.074 --> 00:29:08.116
patriotism and look at that. When
you compare that person to the Vice

941
00:29:08.116 --> 00:29:09.741
you compare that person to the Vice
President, he has his shortcomings,

942
00:29:09.741 --> 00:29:10.574
President, he has his shortcomings,
for sure, but I’m

943
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:10.741
President, he has his shortcomings,
forsure, but I’m reminded

944
00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:13.783
President, he has his shortcomings,
for sure, but I’m reminded of what

945
00:29:13.783 --> 00:29:16.574
for sure, but I’m reminded of what
mayor Ed Koch once said on politics,

946
00:29:16.574 --> 00:29:16.866
mayor Ed Koch once said on politic,
campaigning in

947
00:29:16.866 --> 00:29:19.241
mayor Ed Koch once said on politics,
campaigning in 1978, he said if you

948
00:29:19.241 --> 00:29:21.658
campaigning in 1978, he said if you
like nine out of the 12 things I am

949
00:29:21.658 --> 00:29:23.866
like nine out of the 12 things I am
saying you should vote for me but if

950
00:29:23.866 --> 00:29:26.533
saying you should vote for me but if
you like 12 of them you need a

951
00:29:26.533 --> 00:29:29.908
you like 12 of them you need a
psychiatrist. The point being there

952
00:29:29.908 --> 00:29:31.616
psychiatrist. The point being there
is no politician that is perfect in

953
00:29:31.616 --> 00:29:33.408
is no politician that is perfect in
terms of the fingerprint of the

954
00:29:33.408 --> 00:29:35.408
terms of the fingerprint of the
voter and the politician. For me, I

955
00:29:35.408 --> 00:29:37.199
voter and the politician. For me, I
want that return to normalcy for the

956
00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:39.908
want that return to normalcy for the
United States and for the world. So

957
00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:42.741
United States and for the world. So
I have been a big supporter as a

958
00:29:42.741 --> 00:29:43.866
I have been a big supporter as a
Republican alongside the Lincoln

959
00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:45.908
Republican alongside the Lincoln

States Vice PresidentJoe Biden.

964
00:29:51.033 --> 00:29:52.158
Also, you were a big supporter of
Tmmp and his

965
00:29:52.158 --> 00:29:54.199
Also, you were a big supporter of
Trump and his cheerleader and public

966
00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:54.949
Tmmp and his cheerleader and public
voice, for the

967
00:29:54.949 --> 00:29:57.241
Trump and his cheerleader and public
voice, for the first ten days I

968
00:29:57.241 --> 00:29:58.783
voice, for the first ten days I
think, Anthony. It was 11!

969
00:29:58.783 --> 00:30:01.824

critical of Donald Trump since then,

973
00:30:05.241 --> 00:30:05.699
critical of Donald Tmmp since then,
but would

974
00:30:05.699 --> 00:30:07.241
critical of Donald Trump since then,
but would it be fair to say if he

975
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:09.408
but would it be fair to say if he
hadn’t sacked you you would still be

976
00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:11.074

working for him now? I

977
00:30:11.074 --> 00:30:11.741

working for him now? Ijust want to

978
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:13.533

days later

984
00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:20.866

days later and I accept

985
00:30:20.866 --> 00:30:22.241
days later and I accept
responsibility for that. I did

986
00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:23.866
responsibility for that. I did
something that deserve to be fired

987
00:30:23.866 --> 00:30:26.324
something that deserve to be fired
and I never blamed anybody. For two

988
00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:28.241
and I never blamed anybody. For two
years I tried to stay loyal to the

989
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:30.408
years I tried to stay loyal to the
President and his agenda. You can

990
00:30:30.408 --> 00:30:30.908
President and his agenda. You ran
see me on

991
00:30:30.908 --> 00:30:32.324
President and his agenda. You can
see me on countless shows trying to

992
00:30:32.324 --> 00:30:33.949
see me on countless shows trying to
advocate on behalf of Republican

993
00:30:33.949 --> 00:30:35.866
advocate on behalf of Republican
policies and what the president was

994
00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:38.366
policies and what the president was
doing, but he made it impossible.

995
00:30:38.366 --> 00:30:38.533
doing, but he made it impossibla.
Separating

996
00:30:38.533 --> 00:30:41.574
doing, but he made it impossible.
Separating women and children at the

997
00:30:41.574 --> 00:30:43.074
Separating women and children at the
border, denouncing American

998
00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.074
border, denouncing American
intelligence agencies, calling the

999
00:30:44.074 --> 00:30:45.033
intelligence agencies, railing the
press the

1000
00:30:45.033 --> 00:30:47.366
intelligence agencies, calling the
press the enemy of the people, if

1001
00:30:47.366 --> 00:30:51.408
press the enemy of the people, if
you are using racist, nativist drops

1002
00:30:51.408 --> 00:30:53.616
you are using racist, nativist drops
against American congresswomen, it

1003
00:30:53.616 --> 00:30:53.991
against American congressmmen, it
just became

1004
00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:56.158
against American congresswomen, it
just became impossible. So he was

1005
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:56.866
just became impossibla. So he was
moving the

1006
00:30:56.866 --> 00:30:58.533
just became impossible. So he was
moving the goalposts and I said, OK,

1007
00:30:58.533 --> 00:30:59.741
moving the goalposts and I said, OK,
I ran no longer

1008
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:01.449
moving the goalposts and I said, OK,
I can no longer accept this sort of

1009
00:31:01.449 --> 00:31:02.949
I can no longer accept this sort of
behaviour. That’s what happened.

1010
00:31:02.949 --> 00:31:05.074
behaviour. That’s what happened.
What I would say to you, the facts

1011
00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:07.158
what I would say to you, the facts
are changing,

1012
00:31:07.158 --> 00:31:07.991
What I would say to you, the facts
are changing, then you change your

1013
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:08.741
are changing, then you change your
opinion. My liberal

1014
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:08.991
are changing, then you change your
opinion. My liberalfriends

1015
00:31:08.991 --> 00:31:09.241
are changing, then you change your
opinion. My liberal friends would

1016
00:31:09.241 --> 00:31:11.949
opinion. My liberal friends would
say, you know, he is the same guy he

1017
00:31:11.949 --> 00:31:14.158
say, you know, he is the same guy he
was in 2015, so he is doing the

1018
00:31:14.158 --> 00:31:16.866
was in 2015, so he is doing the
exact same thing is here in 2020, so

1019
00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:19.408
exact same thing is here in 2020, so
why did you change? You must be a

1020
00:31:19.408 --> 00:31:20.616
why did you change? You must be a
better employee. Well, I wouldn’t

1021
00:31:20.616 --> 00:31:20.783
better employee. Well, Iwouldn’t
have

1022
00:31:20.783 --> 00:31:22.949
better employee. Well, I wouldn’t
have supported him for two years if

1023
00:31:22.949 --> 00:31:24.908
have supported him for two years if
I was a bitter employee that make a

1024
00:31:24.908 --> 00:31:26.699
I was a bitter employee that make a
bitter employee. I say he might not

1025
00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:27.616
hither employee. I say he might not
have changed,

1026
00:31:27.616 --> 00:31:29.449
bitter employee. I say he might not
have changed, but I have changed. I

1027
00:31:29.449 --> 00:31:31.241
have changed, but I have changed. I
have become way more psychologically

1028
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:31.449
have become my more psychologically
minded

1029
00:31:31.449 --> 00:31:33.241
have become way more psychologically
minded and empathetic to what is

1030
00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:34.949
minded and empathetic to what is
exactly going on and what the

1031
00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:37.616
exactly going on and what the
struggle is now for working—class

1032
00:31:37.616 --> 00:31:40.574
struggle is now for working—class
families in the US. I grew up in a

1033
00:31:40.574 --> 00:31:40.658
families in the US. I grew up in a
working-class

1034
00:31:40.658 --> 00:31:42.366
families in the US. I grew up in a
working—class family. But it was an

1035
00:31:42.366 --> 00:31:42.658
working-class family. But it was an
aspirational

1036
00:31:42.658 --> 00:31:43.074
working—class family. But it was an
aspirational working—class family

1037
00:31:43.074 --> 00:31:43.908
aspirational working-class family
where

1038
00:31:43.908 --> 00:31:45.616
aspirational working—class family
where we were in the middle class.

1039
00:31:45.616 --> 00:31:45.908
where we were in the middle class.
of

1040
00:31:45.908 --> 00:31:49.366
where we were in the middle class.
Of those families feel today

1041
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:51.283
Of those families feel today
economically desperate. I thought Mr

1042
00:31:51.283 --> 00:31:51.699
economically desperate. I thought Mr
Tmmp would

1043
00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:52.366
economically desperate. I thought Mr
Trump would represent them in

1044
00:31:52.366 --> 00:31:52.491
Tmmp would represent them in
Washington

1045
00:31:52.491 --> 00:31:54.199
Trump would represent them in
Washington but it turns out he was

1046
00:31:54.199 --> 00:31:56.491
Washington but it turns out he was
really just

1047
00:31:56.491 --> 00:31:56.991
Washington but it turns out he was
reallyjust representing himself.

1048
00:31:56.991 --> 00:32:00.199
reallyjust representing himself.
Bonnie? I want to go back to the

1049
00:32:00.199 --> 00:32:02.241
Bonnie? I want to go back to the
question, with respect, to the

1050
00:32:02.241 --> 00:32:04.991
question, with respect, to the
questioner. We use a term like least

1051
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:07.199
questioner. We use a term like least
worst. What are we selecting?

1052
00:32:07.199 --> 00:32:07.866
worst. what are we selecting?
Pims?

1053
00:32:07.866 --> 00:32:11.366
worst. What are we selecting?
Pizzas? This is the problem. We

1054
00:32:11.366 --> 00:32:11.533
Pims? This is the problem. We
don’t

1055
00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:14.699
Pizzas? This is the problem. We
don’t talk about leadership. What

1056
00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:14.908
don’t talk about leadership. what
does

1057
00:32:14.908 --> 00:32:17.408
don’t talk about leadership. What
does least worst mean? What do we

1058
00:32:17.408 --> 00:32:17.991
does least worst mean? what do we
want in a

1059
00:32:17.991 --> 00:32:19.699
does least worst mean? What do we
want in a leader? We have a leader

1060
00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:23.116
want in a leader? We have a leader
here who we got off the television,

1061
00:32:23.116 --> 00:32:25.616
here who we got off the television,
basically. America, he is off the

1062
00:32:25.616 --> 00:32:27.783
basically. America, he is off the
television too. Is that what we are

1063
00:32:27.783 --> 00:32:28.033
telavision too. Is that what we are
about?

1064
00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:31.491
television too. Is that what we are
about? We need to check ourselves,

1065
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:33.199
about? We need to check ourselves,
and our leader is us. If we think

1066
00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:36.491
and our leader is us. If we think
the leader is somewhere up in the

1067
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:37.991
the leader is somewhere up in the
stratosphere, we are going to get

1068
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:39.908
stratosphere, we are going to get
what we deserved. I don’t know what

1069
00:32:39.908 --> 00:32:42.241
what we deserved. I don’t know what
least worst is. I have lived through

1070
00:32:42.241 --> 00:32:43.824
least worst is. I have lived through
a lot of presidents and I know what

1071
00:32:43.824 --> 00:32:45.574
a lot of presidents and I know what
a leader is and we need to talk

1072
00:32:45.574 --> 00:32:47.408
a leader is and we need to talk
about leadership. That is one of the

1073
00:32:47.408 --> 00:32:49.574
about leadership. That is one of the
problems with the Labour Party and

1074
00:32:49.574 --> 00:32:49.824
problams with the labour Party and
the

1075
00:32:49.824 --> 00:32:51.158
problems with the Labour Party and
the Conservative Party. It is a

1076
00:32:51.158 --> 00:32:54.199
the Conservative Party. It is a
leadership issue. Anthony, let me

1077
00:32:54.199 --> 00:32:56.283

Lincoln project of conservatives and

1086
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.241
Lincoln project of conservatives and
republicans who actually tried to

1087
00:33:15.241 --> 00:33:16.616
republicans who actually tried to
save it, conservatism, and make it

1088
00:33:16.616 --> 00:33:18.574
save it, conservatism, and make it
decent again. but the other thing

1089
00:33:18.574 --> 00:33:22.574
decent again. but the other thing
you did, because of your charisma

1090
00:33:22.574 --> 00:33:24.158
you did, because of your charisma
and intelligence, you normalised

1091
00:33:24.158 --> 00:33:25.866
and intelligence, you normalised
Donald Trump, and that is the

1092
00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:26.616
Donald Tmmp, and that is the
problem. I’m

1093
00:33:26.616 --> 00:33:27.574
Donald Trump, and that is the
problem. I’m not saying it’s

1094
00:33:27.574 --> 00:33:27.741
Donald Trump, and that is the
problem. I’m not saying it’sjust

1095
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:28.991
problem. I’m not saying it’s just
you. I’m talking

1096
00:33:28.991 --> 00:33:30.241
problem. I’m not saying it’sjust
you. I’m talking about all of you

1097
00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:32.324
you. I’m talking about all of you

1098
00:33:32.324 --> 00:33:33.283
are very intelligent people in the
beginning, who flocked around this

1099
00:33:33.283 --> 00:33:34.824
beginning, who ﬂocked around this
man

1100
00:33:34.824 --> 00:33:35.616
beginning, who flocked around this
man because of your political

1101
00:33:35.616 --> 00:33:37.908
man because of your political
beliefs. Donald Trump was out of

1102
00:33:37.908 --> 00:33:38.741
beliefs. Donald Tmmp was out of
order for

1103
00:33:38.741 --> 00:33:39.491
beliefs. Donald Trump was out of
order for 30 years.

with talking about least worst, as

1110
00:33:46.949 --> 00:33:48.449
with talking about least worst, as
if we were talking about choosing a

1111
00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:50.783
if we were talking about choosing a
television host instead of leader of

1112
00:33:50.783 --> 00:33:52.658
television host instead of leader of
the free world. This is horrible,

mainstream Republicans were doing

mainstream Republicans were doing
the same thing. It does not take

the same thing. It does not take
away from me at all, if anything it

who is watching the show you have to

1161
00:35:14.116 --> 00:35:15.741
who is watching the show you have to
be very careful about your decision

1162
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:17.866
be very careful about your decision
making because you can get your

1163
00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:18.824
making because you ran get your
pride and ego

1164
00:35:18.824 --> 00:35:20.283
making because you can get your
pride and ego involved in your

1165
00:35:20.283 --> 00:35:21.074
pride and ego involved in your
decision—making and then your

1166
00:35:21.074 --> 00:35:21.241
decision—making and then your
emotions

1167
00:35:21.241 --> 00:35:21.491
decision-making and then your
emotions go

1168
00:35:21.491 --> 00:35:22.324
decision—making and then your
emotions go up and your intelligence

1169
00:35:22.324 --> 00:35:25.783
emotions go up and your intelligence
goes down. For me I had a self

1170
00:35:25.783 --> 00:35:29.324
goes down. For me I had a self
narrative that was ego —based, I had

1171
00:35:29.324 --> 00:35:29.491
narrative that was ego -based, I had
some

1172
00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:30.699
narrative that was ego —based, I had
some measure of financial success in

1173
00:35:30.699 --> 00:35:30.908
some measure offinancial success in
the

1174
00:35:30.908 --> 00:35:32.283
some measure of financial success in
the United States and I wanted to

1175
00:35:32.283 --> 00:35:34.074
the United States and I wanted to
work in the White House. I was

1176
00:35:34.074 --> 00:35:35.366
work in the white House. I was
normalising

1177
00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:38.116
work in the White House. I was
normalising the president because of

1178
00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:41.741
normalising the president because of
the success story of Eisenhower and

1179
00:35:41.741 --> 00:35:42.658
the success story of Eisenhower and
Abraham Lincoln, I

1180
00:35:42.658 --> 00:35:42.783
the success story of Eisenhower and
Abraham Lincoln, Ithought

1181
00:35:42.783 --> 00:35:43.783
the success story of Eisenhower and
Abraham Lincoln, I thought he could

1182
00:35:43.783 --> 00:35:47.074
Abraham Lincoln, I thought he could
not be this crazy. , where he was. I

1183
00:35:47.074 --> 00:35:49.824
not be this crazy. , where he was. I
am telling that as a cautionary tale

1184
00:35:49.824 --> 00:35:49.991
am telling that as a cautionary talc
for

1185
00:35:49.991 --> 00:35:50.241
am telling that as a cautionary tale
for others.

1186
00:35:50.241 --> 00:35:50.449
am telling that as a cautionary talc
for others. Try

1187
00:35:50.449 --> 00:35:51.366
am telling that as a cautionary tale
for others. Try to put your pride

1188
00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:53.449
for others. Try to put your pride
and ego aside when you are making

1189
00:35:53.449 --> 00:35:55.658
and ego aside when you are making
decisions that are political or

1190
00:35:55.658 --> 00:35:56.699
decisions that are political or
relationship based on in your

1191
00:35:56.699 --> 00:36:01.324
relationship based on in your
business. Paula? I hear

1192
00:36:01.324 --> 00:36:01.574
relationship based on in your
business. Paula? I hearwhat

1193
00:36:01.574 --> 00:36:01.741
relationship based on in your
business. Paula? I hear what Anthony

1194
00:36:01.741 --> 00:36:05.408
business. Paula? I hear what Anthony
is saying and it seems that some

1195
00:36:05.408 --> 00:36:08.116
is saying and it seems that some
Republicans are getting by’s remorse

1196
00:36:08.116 --> 00:36:08.366
Republicans are getting by’s remorse
and

1197
00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.741
Republicans are getting by’s remorse
and regretting that Donald Trump is

1198
00:36:09.741 --> 00:36:10.741
and regretting that Donald Tmmp is
their

1199
00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:11.408
and regretting that Donald Trump is
their representative in the

1200
00:36:11.408 --> 00:36:13.949
their representative in the
presidential race. But they have had

1201
00:36:13.949 --> 00:36:14.449
presidential race. But they have had
opportunities through impeachment

1202
00:36:14.449 --> 00:36:17.741
opportunities through impeachment
and others to remove him, why didn’t

1203
00:36:17.741 --> 00:36:19.866
and others to remove him, why didn’t
they take them? Did they put wanting

1204
00:36:19.866 --> 00:36:21.616
they take them? Did they put wanting
to hold onto power ahead of what was

1205
00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:29.116
to hold onto power ahead of what was
good for the country? Yes. David?

1206
00:36:29.116 --> 00:36:29.741
good for the country? Yes. David?
(“an I ask

1207
00:36:29.741 --> 00:36:32.533
good for the country? Yes. David?
Can I ask all the panel if what they

1208
00:36:32.533 --> 00:36:32.949
(“an I ask all the panel if what they
think will

Can I ask all the panel if what they

States if Donald Trump is

re-elected, will they remain united?
We will

re—elected, will they remain united?
We will come to that in a minute.

1214
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:49.116
We will come to that in a minute.
Looking after number one, but

1215
00:36:49.116 --> 00:36:50.866
Looking after number one, but
unfortunately it might be closer

1216
00:36:50.866 --> 00:36:55.199
unfortunately it might be closer
than you think next week. Marie, the

1217
00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:56.408
than you think next week. Marie, the
question from Helen what should

1218
00:36:56.408 --> 00:36:57.741
question from Helan what should
peopla in

1219
00:36:57.741 --> 00:36:58.741
question from Helen what should
people in the UK be concerned? And

1220
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:00.408
people in the UK be concerned? And
yet Donald Trump is steadily behind

1221
00:37:00.408 --> 00:37:01.408
yet Donald Tmmp is steadily behind
in the polls,

1222
00:37:01.408 --> 00:37:03.408
yet Donald Trump is steadily behind
in the polls, but who knows what

1223
00:37:03.408 --> 00:37:06.491
in the polls, but who knows what
could happen? Are you concerned? I

1224
00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:07.949
could happen? Are you concerned? I
definitely think I am concerned

1225
00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:09.574
definitely think I am concerned
because whatever happens in the US

1226
00:37:09.574 --> 00:37:12.491
because whatever happens in the US
is going to impact right around the

1227
00:37:12.491 --> 00:37:14.199
is going to impact right around the
world. In terms of the

1228
00:37:14.199 --> 00:37:14.491
is going to impact right around the
world. In terms of theJewish

1229
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:14.908
world. In terms of the jewish
community a

1230
00:37:14.908 --> 00:37:19.199
world. In terms of theJewish
community a recent poll from the

1231
00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:19.408
community a recent poll from the
American

1232
00:37:19.408 --> 00:37:19.783
community a recent poll from the
Americanjewish

1233
00:37:19.783 --> 00:37:21.199
community a recent poll from the
AmericanJewish Committee said that

1234
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:22.408
American jewish Committee said that
75% of

75% ofJewish people would vote

1237
00:37:24.741 --> 00:37:25.991
75% ofJewish people would vote
Democrat. Certainly Donald Trump has

1238
00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:26.574
Democrat. Certainly Donald Tmmp has
been a very

1239
00:37:26.574 --> 00:37:27.866
Democrat. Certainly Donald Trump has
been a very divisive figure and

1240
00:37:27.866 --> 00:37:31.824
been a very divisive figure and
personally for me he has not

1241
00:37:31.824 --> 00:37:33.408
personally for me he has not
disavowed himself of his

1242
00:37:33.408 --> 00:37:34.574
disavowed himself of his
associations with the right wing or

1243
00:37:34.574 --> 00:37:38.408
associations with the right wing or
white supremacists. But in terms of

1244
00:37:38.408 --> 00:37:42.158
white supremacists. But in terms of
foreign policy he has done some good

1245
00:37:42.158 --> 00:37:45.866
foreign policy he has done some good
things. In the Middle East, for

1246
00:37:45.866 --> 00:37:46.824
things. In the Middle East, for
example, he has helped normalise

1247
00:37:46.824 --> 00:37:49.658
example, he has helped normalise
relations with Israel and Dubai and

1248
00:37:49.658 --> 00:37:53.783
relations with Israel and Dubai and
other countries. With the UAE and

1249
00:37:53.783 --> 00:37:55.783
other countries. with the UAE and
Bahrain.

1250
00:37:55.783 --> 00:37:57.616
other countries. With the UAE and
Bahrain. And of course we have got

1251
00:37:57.616 --> 00:37:58.783
Bahrain. And of course we have got
Brexit which has not yet been

1252
00:37:58.783 --> 00:38:03.741
Brexit which has not yet been
mentioned on this programme. That is

1253
00:38:03.741 --> 00:38:07.533
mentioned on this programme. That is
unusual. Absolutely, and the UK has

1254
00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:10.241
unusual. Absolutely, and the UK has
a strong relationship with the US, a

1255
00:38:10.241 --> 00:38:11.449
a strong relationship with the US, a
special relationship, and I will be

1256
00:38:11.449 --> 00:38:15.158
special relationship, and I will be
very concerned if

1257
00:38:15.158 --> 00:38:16.241
special relationship, and I will be
very concerned ifJoe Biden was the

1258
00:38:16.241 --> 00:38:16.699
very concerned if joe Biden was the
president and

1259
00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:17.241
very concerned ifJoe Biden was the
president and will that relationship

1260
00:38:17.241 --> 00:38:19.574
president and will that relationship
tarry on.

1261
00:38:19.574 --> 00:38:20.616
president and will that relationship
carry on. Would you rather it was

1262
00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:24.199
carry on. Would you rather it was
Donald Trump? I want somebody with

1263
00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:25.366
Donald Trump? I want somebody with
the right values, values are what

1264
00:38:25.366 --> 00:38:27.824
the right values, values are what
matter to me and I want to see the

1265
00:38:27.824 --> 00:38:29.616
matter to me and I want to see the
person who has got those values and

1266
00:38:29.616 --> 00:38:31.741
person who has got those values and
is going to be a leader. We have

1267
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:33.949
is going to be a leader. We have
seen what happened with the Labour

1268
00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:34.991
seen what happened with the labour
Party in this

1269
00:38:34.991 --> 00:38:37.324
seen what happened with the Labour
Party in this country. Of the two

1270
00:38:37.324 --> 00:38:39.533
Party in this country. Of the two
which one? It is very difficult. I

1271
00:38:39.533 --> 00:38:43.616
which one? It is very difficult. I
am not a US citizen, but I am

1272
00:38:43.616 --> 00:38:44.158
am nota US citizen, but I am
looking for

1273
00:38:44.158 --> 00:38:45.783
am not a US citizen, but I am
looking for values and historically

1274
00:38:45.783 --> 00:38:46.741
looking for values and historically
the jewish

1275
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:47.949
looking for values and historically
theJewish community, 75% of them,

1276
00:38:47.949 --> 00:38:49.491
the jewish community, 7596 of them,
would usually

1277
00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:50.199
theJewish community, 75% of them,
would usually be voting Democrats.

1278
00:38:50.199 --> 00:38:52.824
would usually be voting Democrats.
But I am very worried at the outcome

1279
00:38:52.824 --> 00:38:56.741
But I am very worried at the outcome
whatever happens. How can you make

1280
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:57.741
whatever happens. How ran you make
peace with two

1281
00:38:57.741 --> 00:38:58.366
whatever happens. How can you make
peace with two countries that Israel

1282
00:38:58.366 --> 00:39:03.533
peace with two countries that Israel
is not even at war with? Two,

1283
00:39:03.533 --> 00:39:06.199
is not even at war with? Two,
leaving the Palestinians out of

1284
00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:08.158
leaving the Palestinians out of
anything, anything, they were not

1285
00:39:08.158 --> 00:39:09.908
anything, anything, they were not
even at the table. You are talking

1286
00:39:09.908 --> 00:39:11.408
even at the table. You are talking
about the deal that Donald Trump has

1287
00:39:11.408 --> 00:39:15.658
about the deal that Donald Tmmp has
proposed?

1288
00:39:15.658 --> 00:39:17.741
about the deal that Donald Trump has
proposed? That was a peace deal and

1289
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.116
proposed? That was a peace deal and
that is the corn that Donald Trump

1290
00:39:19.116 --> 00:39:22.866
that is the corn that Donald Tmmp
lays down. The

1291
00:39:22.866 --> 00:39:26.408
that is the corn that Donald Trump
lays down. The first racist

1292
00:39:26.408 --> 00:39:27.866
lays down. The first racist
demonstration after Donald Trump

1293
00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:28.033
demonstration after Donald Tmmp
became

1294
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.824
demonstration after Donald Trump
became president was in

1295
00:39:29.824 --> 00:39:32.283
became president was in
Charlottesville. A Jewish

1296
00:39:32.283 --> 00:39:32.741
became president was in
Charlottesville. AJewish girl was

1297
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:33.741
Charlothesvilla. A jewish girt was
killed.

1298
00:39:33.741 --> 00:39:34.949
Charlottesville. AJewish girl was
killed. This was guys walking down

1299
00:39:34.949 --> 00:39:37.158
killed. This was guys walking down
the street looking like something

1300
00:39:37.158 --> 00:39:41.116
the street looking like something
out of the Nuremberg rallies saying

1301
00:39:41.116 --> 00:39:41.783
out of the Nuremberg rallies saying
jews will not

1302
00:39:41.783 --> 00:39:43.199
out of the Nuremberg rallies saying
Jews will not replace us. I do not

1303
00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:45.574
jews will not replace us. I do not
get it. I really do

1304
00:39:45.574 --> 00:39:46.824
Jews will not replace us. I do not
get it. I really do not get it how

1305
00:39:46.824 --> 00:39:47.241
get it. I really do not get it how
anybody ran

1306
00:39:47.241 --> 00:39:48.199
get it. I really do not get it how
anybody can talk about backing this

1307
00:39:48.199 --> 00:39:48.324
anybody ran talk about backing this
man

1308
00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:52.741
anybody can talk about backing this
man with that kind of thing. It is a

1309
00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:54.574
man with that kind of thing. It is a
total con. To leave the Palestinians

1310
00:39:54.574 --> 00:39:56.199
total con. To leave the Palestinians
out of this is another part of the

1311
00:39:56.199 --> 00:39:59.741
out of this is another part of the
problem. While I have said in

1312
00:39:59.741 --> 00:39:59.824
problem. whila I have said in
fairness

1313
00:39:59.824 --> 00:40:03.866
problem. While I have said in
fairness to him in terms of foreign

1314
00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:04.866
fairness to him in terms of foreign
policy, the normalisation of

1315
00:40:04.866 --> 00:40:08.116
policy, the normalisation of
relationships is important. That is

1316
00:40:08.116 --> 00:40:10.616
relationships is important. That is
what I was talking about when I was

1317
00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:13.824
what I was talking about when I was
talking about trauma. I am talking

1318
00:40:13.824 --> 00:40:15.199
talking about trauma. I am talking
about the 360 degrees of this. How

1319
00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:17.366
about the 360 degrees of this. How
ran you look at

1320
00:40:17.366 --> 00:40:19.949
about the 360 degrees of this. How
can you look at that? Joe Biden came

1321
00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:20.366
ran you look at that? joe Biden came
into the

1322
00:40:20.366 --> 00:40:22.033
can you look at that? Joe Biden came
into the presidency because of

1323
00:40:22.033 --> 00:40:23.408
into the presidency because of
Charlottesville. That literally was

1324
00:40:23.408 --> 00:40:23.658
Charlothesvilla. That literally was
all

1325
00:40:23.658 --> 00:40:25.783
Charlottesville. That literally was
all white guys walking down... You

1326
00:40:25.783 --> 00:40:28.824
all white guys walking down... You
saw it. Explain it to me. I agree

1327
00:40:28.824 --> 00:40:29.116
saw it. Explain itto me. Iagree
that

1328
00:40:29.116 --> 00:40:31.449
saw it. Explain it to me. I agree
that Donald Trump is very divisive.

1329
00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:33.074
that Donald Tmmp is very divisive.
Explain that to

1330
00:40:33.074 --> 00:40:34.449
that Donald Trump is very divisive.
Explain that to me, please. I am

1331
00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:36.366
Explain that to me, please. I am
asking you because I do not

1332
00:40:36.366 --> 00:40:38.408
asking you because I do not
understand how a Jewish person can

1333
00:40:38.408 --> 00:40:38.949
understand how a jewish person ran
say, OK he

1334
00:40:38.949 --> 00:40:41.491
understand how a Jewish person can
say, OK he made peace over there,

1335
00:40:41.491 --> 00:40:46.908
say, OK he made peace over there,
but yet the anti—Semitism tropes are

1336
00:40:46.908 --> 00:40:47.533
but yet the anti-Semitism tropes are
gaining a hold

1337
00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:50.783
but yet the anti—Semitism tropes are
gaining a hold in this country. I

1338
00:40:50.783 --> 00:40:53.991
gaining a hold in this country. I
don’t get it. Explain to me. I

1339
00:40:53.991 --> 00:40:54.324
gaining a hold in this country. I
don’t get it. Explain to me. Ijust

1340
00:40:54.324 --> 00:40:56.366
don’t get it. Explain to me. Ijust
want to confirm to you that where

1341
00:40:56.366 --> 00:40:57.824
want to confirm to you that where
there have been policies like the

1342
00:40:57.824 --> 00:40:59.991
there have been policies like the
travel ban to Muslim countries, the

1343
00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:01.824
travel ban to Muslim countries, the
Board of Deputies has criticised

1344
00:41:01.824 --> 00:41:03.824
Board of Deputies has criticised
Donald Trump, we do not hesitate to

1345
00:41:03.824 --> 00:41:04.116
Donald Tmmp, we do not hesitate to
criticise

1346
00:41:04.116 --> 00:41:05.741
Donald Trump, we do not hesitate to
criticise his policies. How do you

1347
00:41:05.741 --> 00:41:13.324
criticise his policies. How do you
feel? Let me bring neck in. Riveting

1348
00:41:13.324 --> 00:41:15.199
feel? Let me bring neck in. Riveting
though that is. I must bring the

1349
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:18.824
though that is. I must bring the
rest of the panel in. Nick. I

1350
00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:21.533
rest of the panel in. Nick. I
presume you are supporting Joe

1351
00:41:21.533 --> 00:41:21.741
presume you are supporting joe
Biden,

1352
00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:22.908
presume you are supporting Joe
Biden, obviously. Should we be

1353
00:41:22.908 --> 00:41:24.158
Biden, obviously. Should we be
concerned here that we are looking

1354
00:41:24.158 --> 00:41:26.533
concerned here that we are looking
at the two least worst candidate, as

1355
00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:29.158
at the two least worst candidate, as
Helan says? It

1356
00:41:29.158 --> 00:41:30.866
at the two least worst candidate, as
Helen says? It is a decision for the

1357
00:41:30.866 --> 00:41:31.033
Helan says? It is a decision for the
American

1358
00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:32.824
Helen says? It is a decision for the
American people between the two

1359
00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:34.241
American people between the two
candidates. It would not come as a

1360
00:41:34.241 --> 00:41:36.408
candidates. It would not come as a
surprise to see if I was in America

1361
00:41:36.408 --> 00:41:39.616
surprise to see if I was in America
I would be supporting the Democrats.

1362
00:41:39.616 --> 00:41:42.033
I would be supporting the Democrats.
Obviously I share the concerns about

1363
00:41:42.033 --> 00:41:43.699
Obviously I share the concerns about
divisive language. Of course I

1364
00:41:43.699 --> 00:41:45.991
divisive language. Of course I
absolutely do and I have spoken out

1365
00:41:45.991 --> 00:41:47.616
absolutely do and I have spoken out
in the past around things like the

1366
00:41:47.616 --> 00:41:51.491
in the past around things like the
travel ban. But at the same time we

1367
00:41:51.491 --> 00:41:53.658
travel ban. But at the same time we
have to recognise this election will

1368
00:41:53.658 --> 00:41:53.824
have to recognise this elaction will
take

1369
00:41:53.824 --> 00:41:55.783
have to recognise this election will
take place next week, it is a

1370
00:41:55.783 --> 00:41:58.324
take place next week, it is a
decision for the American people,

1371
00:41:58.324 --> 00:41:58.824
decision for the American peopla,
and our

1372
00:41:58.824 --> 00:42:00.408
decision for the American people,
and our relationship with America is

1373
00:42:00.408 --> 00:42:03.366
and our relationship with America is
not related to one president or one

1374
00:42:03.366 --> 00:42:07.074
not related to one president or one
era, it goes back over generations.

1375
00:42:07.074 --> 00:42:07.991
era, it goes back over generations.
There are cultural, political,

1376
00:42:07.991 --> 00:42:10.741
There are cultural, political,
economic ties and there are huge

1377
00:42:10.741 --> 00:42:12.574
economic ties and there are huge
challenges around the world, the

1378
00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:15.366
challenges around the world, the
coronavirus crisis, and climate

1379
00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.824
coronavirus crisis, and climate
change to name two of them. We have

1380
00:42:17.824 --> 00:42:20.408
change to name two of them. We have
to work with the winner of this

1381
00:42:20.408 --> 00:42:22.199
to work with the winner of this
presidential election and at the

1382
00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:24.824
presidential election and at the
same time be a critical friend to

1383
00:42:24.824 --> 00:42:26.741
same time be a critical friend to
America and told the president to

1384
00:42:26.741 --> 00:42:28.491
America and told the president to
account and be critical where

1385
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:30.408
account and be critical where
necessary. That is the approach a

1386
00:42:30.408 --> 00:42:30.574
necessary. That is the approach a
labour

1387
00:42:30.574 --> 00:42:31.824
necessary. That is the approach a
Labour government would take to the

1388
00:42:31.824 --> 00:42:32.283
labour government would take to the
winner of

1389
00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:32.699
Labour government would take to the
winner of this presidential

1390
00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:37.824
winner of this presidential
election. It will be tricky for the

1391
00:42:37.824 --> 00:42:38.116
election. It will be tricky for the
government if

1392
00:42:38.116 --> 00:42:39.158
election. It will be tricky for the
government ifJoe Biden gets in. He

1393
00:42:39.158 --> 00:42:40.491
government if joe Biden gets in. He
has had

1394
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.283
government ifJoe Biden gets in. He
has had some strong things to say

1395
00:42:42.283 --> 00:42:43.741
has had some strong things to say
about the internal market will, as

1396
00:42:43.741 --> 00:42:47.366
about the internal market will, as
has Nancy Pelosi in Congress. Joe

1397
00:42:47.366 --> 00:42:47.699
has Nancy Pelosi in Congress. joe
Biden says

1398
00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:49.033
has Nancy Pelosi in Congress. Joe
Biden says he respects the result of

1399
00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:52.783
Biden says he respects the result of
the referendum on Brexit. That is

1400
00:42:52.783 --> 00:42:55.241
the referendum on Brexit. That is
not what I am referring to. You know

1401
00:42:55.241 --> 00:43:00.866
not what I am referring to. You know
what he said. I am on broadly the

1402
00:43:00.866 --> 00:43:02.658
what he said. I am on broadly the
same page as Nick. I will respect

1403
00:43:02.658 --> 00:43:03.741
same page as Nick. I will respect
and trust the

1404
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:04.741
same page as Nick. I will respect
and trust thejudgment

1405
00:43:04.741 --> 00:43:05.324
same page as Nick. I will respect
and trust the judgment of the

1406
00:43:05.324 --> 00:43:06.866
and trust the judgment of the
American people. Any trade deal

1407
00:43:06.866 --> 00:43:09.491
American people. Any trade deal
between the US and the UK must be

1408
00:43:09.491 --> 00:43:10.824
between the US and the UK must be
contingent on the respect of the

1409
00:43:10.824 --> 00:43:14.866
contingent on the respect of the
Good Friday Agreement. We plan to

1410
00:43:14.866 --> 00:43:16.783
Good Friday Agreement. We plan to
respect the Good Friday Agreement.

1411
00:43:16.783 --> 00:43:19.574
respect the Good Friday Agreement.
He is concerned you will not. My

1412
00:43:19.574 --> 00:43:21.199
He is concerned you will not. My
point is are you concerned that if

1413
00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:21.991
point is are you concerned that if
joe Biden wins

1414
00:43:21.991 --> 00:43:23.366
point is are you concerned that if
Joe Biden wins the relationship

1415
00:43:23.366 --> 00:43:24.616
Joe Biden wins the relationship
between the British Government and

1416
00:43:24.616 --> 00:43:28.699
between the British Government and
America might be less warm? No I am

1417
00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:29.574
America might be lass warm? No I am
not for two

1418
00:43:29.574 --> 00:43:30.991
America might be less warm? No I am
not for two reasons. We have been

1419
00:43:30.991 --> 00:43:32.574
not for two reasons. We have been
bending over backwards to respect

1420
00:43:32.574 --> 00:43:34.366
bending over backwards to respect
the Good Friday Agreement for the

1421
00:43:34.366 --> 00:43:37.199
the Good Friday Agreement for the
last few years since the Brexit vote

1422
00:43:37.199 --> 00:43:39.866
last few years since the Brexit vote
happen. To make a general point, the

1423
00:43:39.866 --> 00:43:41.366
happen. To make a general point, the
Conservatives in government have

1424
00:43:41.366 --> 00:43:43.158
Conservatives in government have
worked closely with Republican

1425
00:43:43.158 --> 00:43:44.574
worked closely with Republican
presidents like Dwight Eisenhower

1426
00:43:44.574 --> 00:43:46.824
presidents like Dwight Eisenhower
and Ronald Reagan and Democrat

1427
00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.908
and Ronald Reagan and Democrat
presidents like reasonable, Clinton

1428
00:43:48.908 --> 00:43:49.116
presidents like reasonabla, (linton
and

1429
00:43:49.116 --> 00:43:52.824
presidents like reasonable, Clinton
and Barack Obama and Labour in

1430
00:43:52.824 --> 00:43:52.991
and Barack Obama and labour in
office

1431
00:43:52.991 --> 00:43:55.574
and Barack Obama and Labour in
office have done the same. Whoever

1432
00:43:55.574 --> 00:43:56.283
office have done the same. whoever
occupies the

1433
00:43:56.283 --> 00:43:58.324
office have done the same. Whoever
occupies the White House, as our

1434
00:43:58.324 --> 00:43:58.533
occupies the white House, as our
closest

1435
00:43:58.533 --> 00:44:00.074
occupies the White House, as our
closest and long—standing ally, we

1436
00:44:00.074 --> 00:44:00.908
closest and long-standing ally, we
will always

1437
00:44:00.908 --> 00:44:02.116
closest and long—standing ally, we
will always work closely and

1438
00:44:02.116 --> 00:44:03.741
will always work closely and
cooperatively with America whoever

1439
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:05.741
cooperatively with America whoever
occupies that office. I trust the

1440
00:44:05.741 --> 00:44:07.949
occupies that office. I trust the
American people to make their own

1441
00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:10.449
American people to make their own
decision. Did you ever vote, Bonnie,

1442
00:44:10.449 --> 00:44:13.783
decision. Did you ever vote, Bonnie,
in the American election? Of course

1443
00:44:13.783 --> 00:44:14.408
in the American elaction? Of course
I did. And

1444
00:44:14.408 --> 00:44:18.866
in the American election? Of course
I did. And here as well. Briefly.

1445
00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:21.616
I did. And here as well. Brieﬂy.
Nancy Pelosi,

1446
00:44:21.616 --> 00:44:22.449
I did. And here as well. Briefly.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the house,

1447
00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:24.908
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the house,
and she will be on Tuesday, she

1448
00:44:24.908 --> 00:44:26.449
and she will be on Tuesday, she
ratifies the deal. I hope you guys

1449
00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:28.783
ratifies the deal. I hope you guys
are right that you are not

1450
00:44:28.783 --> 00:44:30.116
are right that you are not
disturbing the Good Friday

1451
00:44:30.116 --> 00:44:34.741
disturbing the Good Friday
Agreement. Joe Biden is Irish. He

1452
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:35.074
Agreement. joe Biden is Irish. He
will not

1453
00:44:35.074 --> 00:44:35.283
Agreement. Joe Biden is Irish. He
will not let

1454
00:44:35.283 --> 00:44:35.533
Agreement. joe Biden is Irish. He
will not let you

1455
00:44:35.533 --> 00:44:37.533
Agreement. Joe Biden is Irish. He
will not let you get away with that.

1456
00:44:37.533 --> 00:44:39.741
will not let you get away with that.
Let’s take another question, I

1457
00:44:39.741 --> 00:44:39.866
Let’s take another question, I
rannot

1458
00:44:39.866 --> 00:44:41.366
Let’s take another question, I
cannot believe we have come so late

1459
00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:42.741
cannot believe we have come so late
in the programme to this because it

1460
00:44:42.741 --> 00:44:44.158
in the programme to this because it
has been first in the programme for

1461
00:44:44.158 --> 00:44:49.116
has been first in the programme for
months.

1462
00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.783
Yes, good evening, Fiona.

1463
00:44:55.783 --> 00:44:57.241
Good evening, panel.

1464
00:44:57.241 --> 00:44:59.366
A recent study from Imperial
Forecasting suggests that Covid—19

1465
00:44:59.366 --> 00:45:01.991
deaths in wave 2 could far exceed
those in wave 1.

1466
00:45:01.991 --> 00:45:04.408
Given that France, Germany and UK
devolved administrations are either

1467
00:45:04.408 --> 00:45:07.324
in or have announced a total
lockdown, why is the UK government

1468
00:45:07.324 --> 00:45:12.283
so reluctant to follow suit?

1469
00:45:13.324 --> 00:45:17.158
Nick. I

1470
00:45:17.158 --> 00:45:17.741
Nick. lam

1471
00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:19.116
Nick. I am speaking to you from
Walas

1472
00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:21.241
Nick. I am speaking to you from
Wales this evening and I am not in

1473
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:24.449
Wales this evening and I am not in
the studio because we are in day six

1474
00:45:24.449 --> 00:45:25.074
the studio because we are in day six
of our

1475
00:45:25.074 --> 00:45:26.408
the studio because we are in day six
of ourfirebreak, our 17

1476
00:45:26.408 --> 00:45:26.616
the studio because we are in day six
of our firebreak, our 17 day

1477
00:45:26.616 --> 00:45:29.699
of our firebreak, our 17 day
firebreak here in Wales. That action

1478
00:45:29.699 --> 00:45:29.741
firebreak here in Walas. That action
is

1479
00:45:29.741 --> 00:45:31.991
firebreak here in Wales. That action
is being taken here in Wales to try

1480
00:45:31.991 --> 00:45:36.616
is being taken here in Wales to try
to get on top of the virus. I think

1481
00:45:36.616 --> 00:45:37.449
to get on top of the vims. I think
that is the

1482
00:45:37.449 --> 00:45:38.866
to get on top of the virus. I think
that is the appropriate thing to do.

1483
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:42.783
that is the appropriate thing to do.
I think if we look at the situation

1484
00:45:42.783 --> 00:45:45.824
I think if we look at the situation
in England, I think we are at a

1485
00:45:45.824 --> 00:45:47.199
in England, I think we are at a
critical moment. Keir Starmer argued

1486
00:45:47.199 --> 00:45:50.699
critical moment. Keir Starmer argued
for a circuit breaker of two to

1487
00:45:50.699 --> 00:45:52.741
for a circuit breaker of two to
three weeks. I do understand that

1488
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:54.241
three weeks. I do understand that
time is passing, of course it is,

1489
00:45:54.241 --> 00:46:00.658
time is passing, of course it is,
but I think... Action is required.

1490
00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:02.116
but I think... Action is required.
It is absolutely clear that what we

1491
00:46:02.116 --> 00:46:06.324
It is absolutely clear that what we
have to do now is to make sure that

1492
00:46:06.324 --> 00:46:10.116
have to do now is to make sure that
we not only have that circuit

1493
00:46:10.116 --> 00:46:11.741
we not only have that circuit
breaker, but also that time is used

1494
00:46:11.741 --> 00:46:13.741
breaker, but also that time is used
to get on top of test, trace and

1495
00:46:13.741 --> 00:46:17.033
to get on top of test, trace and
isolate. Nick, I

1496
00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:18.283
to get on top of test, trace and
isolate. Nick, lam going

1497
00:46:18.283 --> 00:46:18.574
to get on top of test, trace and
isolate. Nick, I am going to

1498
00:46:18.574 --> 00:46:18.741
to get on top of test, trace and
isolate. Nick, I am going tojump

1499
00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:20.033
isolate. Nick, lam going tojump
in. Nick, I

1500
00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:20.241
isolate. Nick, lam going tojump
in. Nick, lam

1501
00:46:20.241 --> 00:46:20.491
isolate. Nick, I am going tojump
in. Nick, I am sorry,

1502
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:20.741
isolate. Nick, I am going tojump
in. Nick, lam sorry, not

1503
00:46:20.741 --> 00:46:21.616
isolate. Nick, I am going tojump
in. Nick, I am sorry, not only are

1504
00:46:21.616 --> 00:46:23.366
in. Nick, I am sorry, not only are
you in a circuit breaker, it looks

1505
00:46:23.366 --> 00:46:25.491
you in a circuit breaker, it looks
like your computer is having a bit

1506
00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:27.574
like your computer is having a bit
of a circuit breakdown as well. We

1507
00:46:27.574 --> 00:46:28.574
of a circuit breakdown as well. We
ran hear you,

1508
00:46:28.574 --> 00:46:29.699
of a circuit breakdown as well. We
can hear you, but we cannot see you.

1509
00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:30.366
ran hear you, but we cannot see you.
I will come

1510
00:46:30.366 --> 00:46:31.616
can hear you, but we cannot see you.
I will come back to you as soon as

1511
00:46:31.616 --> 00:46:35.366
I will come back to you as soon as
we get that reinstated. Chris,

1512
00:46:35.366 --> 00:46:37.283
we get that reinstated. Chris,
coming back to the question. You

1513
00:46:37.283 --> 00:46:40.324
coming back to the question. You
have got France and Germany and the

1514
00:46:40.324 --> 00:46:41.699
have got France and Germany and the
devolved administrations in Lough

1515
00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:43.199
devolved administrations in Lough
dens. Germany is going to look down

1516
00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:45.241
dens. Germany is going to look down
and it has got half as many new

1517
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:45.616
and it has got half as many new
rases as

1518
00:46:45.616 --> 00:46:46.949
and it has got half as many new
cases as us and a fraction of the

1519
00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:47.783
rases as us and a fraction of the
number of

1520
00:46:47.783 --> 00:46:49.574
cases as us and a fraction of the
number of deaths every day, surely

1521
00:46:49.574 --> 00:46:53.241
number of deaths every day, surely
it is a matter of time? Each country

1522
00:46:53.241 --> 00:46:55.074
it is a matter of time? Each country
is different and we need to

1523
00:46:55.074 --> 00:46:57.366
is different and we need to
carefully balance the right approach

1524
00:46:57.366 --> 00:46:58.949
carefully balance the right approach
for our country. I know you are not

1525
00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.366
for our country. I know you are not
going to come on and say definitely

1526
00:47:01.366 --> 00:47:04.324
going to come on and say definitely
yes there is a lockdown, but anyone

1527
00:47:04.324 --> 00:47:05.908
yes there is a lockdown, but anyone
looking at the graphs must be

1528
00:47:05.908 --> 00:47:06.824
looking at the graphs must be
thinking it is

1529
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:06.991
looking at the graphs must be
thinking it isjust

1530
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:07.866
looking at the graphs must be
thinking it is just a

1531
00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:08.241
looking at the graphs must be
thinking it isjust a matter of

1532
00:47:08.241 --> 00:47:09.158
thinking it is just a matter of
time.

1533
00:47:09.158 --> 00:47:10.574
thinking it isjust a matter of
time. We have really different

1534
00:47:10.574 --> 00:47:11.949
time. We have really different
circumstances in different regions

1535
00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:14.366
circumstances in different regions
of the country. The East of England

1536
00:47:14.366 --> 00:47:16.866
of the country. The East of England
only has one quarter of the cases

1537
00:47:16.866 --> 00:47:19.366
only has one quarter of the cases
that the North West has. Cases are

1538
00:47:19.366 --> 00:47:23.116
that the North West has. Cases are
rising everywhere. The World Health

1539
00:47:23.116 --> 00:47:24.158
rising everywhere. The World Health
Organization and the Deputy Chief

1540
00:47:24.158 --> 00:47:27.991
Organization and the Deputy Chief
Medical Officer says regional makes

1541
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:33.324
Medical Officer says regional makes
sense. We have to balance it with

1542
00:47:33.324 --> 00:47:34.616
sense. We have to balance it with
children’s education, mental health,

1543
00:47:34.616 --> 00:47:36.241
children’s education, mental health,
people seeking cancer treatment,

1544
00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:37.783
people seeking cancer treatment,
jobs, we have to balance those

1545
00:47:37.783 --> 00:47:40.824
jobs, we have to balance those
considerations against the health

1546
00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:42.866
considerations against the health
consideration and get it right.

1547
00:47:42.866 --> 00:47:44.116
consideration and get it right.
Things are working differently in

1548
00:47:44.116 --> 00:47:46.324
Things are working differently in
different parts of the country, that

1549
00:47:46.324 --> 00:47:47.491
different parts of the country, that
is why this careful and well

1550
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:50.783
is why this careful and well
calibrated balance and balance

1551
00:47:50.783 --> 00:47:52.074
calibrated balance and balance
approach has been taken. That will

1552
00:47:52.074 --> 00:47:54.741
approach has been taken. That will
be kept under review and if the

1553
00:47:54.741 --> 00:47:55.574
be kept under review and if the
facts change, different decisions

1554
00:47:55.574 --> 00:47:58.949
facts change, different decisions
might be taken in the future. I am

1555
00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:01.116
might be taken in the future. I am
listening to you go through that and

1556
00:48:01.116 --> 00:48:03.324
listening to you go through that and
I have got no crystal ball and I

1557
00:48:03.324 --> 00:48:06.283
I have got no crystal ball and I
have got no medical knowledge, but

1558
00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:06.866
have got no medical knowladge, but
watching the

1559
00:48:06.866 --> 00:48:07.908
have got no medical knowledge, but
watching the graphs, cases are

1560
00:48:07.908 --> 00:48:08.116
watching the graphs, rases are
increasing

1561
00:48:08.116 --> 00:48:08.949
watching the graphs, cases are
increasing everywhere, are you going

1562
00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:12.033
increasing everywhere, are you going
to end up coming back here in two or

1563
00:48:12.033 --> 00:48:14.949
to end up coming back here in two or
three weeks and saying, we have seen

1564
00:48:14.949 --> 00:48:18.158
three weeks and saying, we have seen
the facts and we are going into a

1565
00:48:18.158 --> 00:48:19.866
the facts and we are going into a
lockdown? I do not have a crystal

1566
00:48:19.866 --> 00:48:21.491
lockdown? I do not have a crystal
ball and it would be rash to make

1567
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:23.866
ball and it would be rash to make
predictions about the future. But to

1568
00:48:23.866 --> 00:48:25.574
predictions about the future. But to
date looking at the regional

1569
00:48:25.574 --> 00:48:27.033
date looking at the regional
differences, looking at the costs of

1570
00:48:27.033 --> 00:48:31.533
differences, looking at the costs of
a lockdown would impose on health,

1571
00:48:31.533 --> 00:48:32.741
a lockdown would impose on health,
mental health, children’s education,

1572
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:35.908
mental health, children’s education,
jobs and so on, the balance being

1573
00:48:35.908 --> 00:48:36.283
jobs and so on, the balance being
stmck is

1574
00:48:36.283 --> 00:48:37.241
jobs and so on, the balance being
struck is the right one. The World

1575
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:37.491
stmck is the right one. The World
Health

1576
00:48:37.491 --> 00:48:38.324
struck is the right one. The World
Health Organization agree with that

1577
00:48:38.324 --> 00:48:40.324
Health Organization agree with that
and it is kept under review the

1578
00:48:40.324 --> 00:48:41.449
and it is kept under review the
whole time, which is a sensible

1579
00:48:41.449 --> 00:48:44.324
whole time, which is a sensible
thing to do. Donna, you are shaking

1580
00:48:44.324 --> 00:48:46.533
thing to do. Donna, you are shaking
your head and I know that you have

1581
00:48:46.533 --> 00:48:48.908
your head and I know that you have
been shielding with your husband for

1582
00:48:48.908 --> 00:48:51.033
been shielding with your husband for
eight months now.

1583
00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:52.116
Eight months, yeah.

1584
00:48:52.116 --> 00:48:55.116
I’d just like to come back
to that point, so me

1585
00:48:55.116 --> 00:48:57.824
and my husband have been shielding
since the 23rd of March.

1586
00:48:57.824 --> 00:49:02.866
Just to give a brief idea,
my husband partway through this went

1587
00:49:04.283 --> 00:49:07.658
on to kidney dialysis,
so my question really is,

1588
00:49:07.658 --> 00:49:10.033
the shielding group,
the 2.2 million people at the end

1589
00:49:10.033 --> 00:49:14.949
of March that got these
letters who were petrified

1590
00:49:14.949 --> 00:49:17.616
to go out of their homes,
and we couldn’t even go

1591
00:49:17.616 --> 00:49:22.616
to our gardens, now the cases
are going absolutely

1592
00:49:26.574 --> 00:49:27.533
through the roof —

1593
00:49:27.533 --> 00:49:30.241
where is the common sense?

1594
00:49:30.241 --> 00:49:31.908
And I know obviously
there are treatments,

1595
00:49:31.908 --> 00:49:34.324
but can Ijust highlight
there are thousands of people

1596
00:49:34.324 --> 00:49:38.408
waiting for organ donations
across this country,

1597
00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:41.783
and, as I said to Fiona earlier,
the plight of my husband and many

1598
00:49:41.783 --> 00:49:46.783
others in the same situation
is being put on a list to be taken

1599
00:49:55.449 --> 00:49:57.783
off a list,
to be put back on a list?

1600
00:49:57.783 --> 00:50:00.949
Now, my fear is we are going to get
back to routine operations,

1601
00:50:00.949 --> 00:50:01.991
transplantation, getting stopped.

1602
00:50:01.991 --> 00:50:04.366
It’s already happening in Leeds,
in Nottingham, and you talk

1603
00:50:04.366 --> 00:50:05.408
about the tier system.

1604
00:50:05.408 --> 00:50:07.616
I live in West Lindsey,
where at the moment

1605
00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:09.741
it is relatively low,
in Tier 1, however literally

1606
00:50:09.741 --> 00:50:09.949
ii

1607
00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:14.991
to the two miles to the side
of me is Nottinghamshire,

1608
00:50:15.449 --> 00:50:17.783
who have gone into Tier 3
from Friday, and also

1609
00:50:17.783 --> 00:50:20.408
bordering is South Yorkshire,
and from I think Saturday we now

1610
00:50:20.408 --> 00:50:22.824
have North Lincolnshire
and East Hull, so with all due

1611
00:50:22.824 --> 00:50:24.533
respect it’s a matter
of time before...

1612
00:50:24.533 --> 00:50:26.699
So surely we should jump
on this bandwagon now

1613
00:50:26.699 --> 00:50:31.741
before it gets any worse?

1614
00:50:33.241 --> 00:50:35.866
Carl, you have your hand up,
and I know you’re working

1615
00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.741
as a contact tracer at the moment,
so you have a very

1616
00:50:38.741 --> 00:50:39.741
particular view of this.

1617
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:40.824
What is your response?

1618
00:50:40.824 --> 00:50:42.408
Yeah, lam.

1619
00:50:42.408 --> 00:50:44.574
Well, I think we’ve already proved
lockdowns don’t work.

1620
00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:46.741
We tried it before.

1621
00:50:46.741 --> 00:50:51.741
All it’s doing is kicking
the can down the road.

1622
00:50:52.283 --> 00:50:55.616
As soon as you let people out again,
people are back to square one,

1623
00:50:55.616 --> 00:50:56.824
being exposed to the virus.

1624
00:50:56.824 --> 00:51:01.866
So what you think answer is?

1625
00:51:02.116 --> 00:51:04.533
Well, I think we should start
looking at different models,

1626
00:51:04.533 --> 00:51:08.741
like Sweden, for example.

1627
00:51:08.741 --> 00:51:12.824
Sweden tried a completely different
approach to anywhere else pretty

1628
00:51:12.824 --> 00:51:16.199
much in Europe and they have had no
massive rise in cases any different

1629
00:51:16.199 --> 00:51:17.408
to anywhere else in Europe.

1630
00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:18.449
They didn’t lockdown.

1631
00:51:18.449 --> 00:51:19.866
They just enforced
the social distancing.

1632
00:51:19.866 --> 00:51:24.908
Bars stayed open, pubs stayed open,
schools stayed open.

1633
00:51:29.033 --> 00:51:30.074
Sweden’s in trouble.

1634
00:51:30.074 --> 00:51:31.991
And people carried
on pretty much as normal.

1635
00:51:31.991 --> 00:51:33.033
Imean...

1636
00:51:33.033 --> 00:51:34.949
There were quite a few
restrictions in Sweden.

1637
00:51:34.949 --> 00:51:35.949
Yeah, Sweden’s in trouble.

1638
00:51:35.949 --> 00:51:37.033
They tried herd immunity.

1639
00:51:37.033 --> 00:51:38.241
That’s what you’re talking about.

1640
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:40.158
And Sweden got in some
trouble with that.

1641
00:51:40.158 --> 00:51:45.116
I think one of the things,
and the lady who spoke,

1642
00:51:46.616 --> 00:51:48.908
I commiserate with her —
I’ve been separated from my

1643
00:51:48.908 --> 00:51:50.616
husband since February,
we can’t be together.

1644
00:51:50.616 --> 00:51:53.949
It...
The same thing in the United States.

1645
00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:58.949
We don’t have any leadership,
we don’t have a leader.

1646
00:52:00.866 --> 00:52:04.241
This isn’t some kind of thing
you put on a graph and stand up,

1647
00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:07.116
behind a podium, and talk to people
holding up graphs and charts.

1648
00:52:07.116 --> 00:52:08.574
The only truth here is Covid.

1649
00:52:08.574 --> 00:52:12.158
Covid is the truth.

1650
00:52:12.158 --> 00:52:16.866
And then you move from there,
and we work to unite the country.

1651
00:52:16.866 --> 00:52:20.824
We’re all in this together.

1652
00:52:20.824 --> 00:52:24.074
We’re in this together.

1653
00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:25.783
We’re not tiers in all of this.

1654
00:52:25.783 --> 00:52:26.949
We are together.

1655
00:52:26.949 --> 00:52:29.574
So we need a leader who can
talk to us together,

1656
00:52:29.574 --> 00:52:34.616
and the United States of America has
51 solutions running

1657
00:52:39.408 --> 00:52:41.533
around there because the leadership
refuses to take responsibility.

1658
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:42.741
We need a leader here.

1659
00:52:42.741 --> 00:52:43.741
Anthony?

1660
00:52:43.741 --> 00:52:45.533
Well, I mean, I agree once again.

1661
00:52:45.533 --> 00:52:48.116
I think the biggest problem, again,
thinking about whatJoe Biden

1662
00:52:48.116 --> 00:52:50.741
was saying, he wants to shutdown
the virus and not

1663
00:52:50.741 --> 00:52:51.783
necessarily the economy.

1664
00:52:51.783 --> 00:52:53.949
If you just went through
the protocol and standards

1665
00:52:53.949 --> 00:52:57.033
of South Korea, who had experience
with MERS and SARS, and wejust

1666
00:52:57.033 --> 00:53:02.033
copy their best practices,
we would be well on our way,

1667
00:53:07.366 --> 00:53:09.533
whether it’s the United Kingdom
or the United States.

1668
00:53:09.533 --> 00:53:12.199
I willjust point out, South Korea,
20 deaths per million,

1669
00:53:12.199 --> 00:53:13.366
on a per capita basis.

1670
00:53:13.366 --> 00:53:15.033
The United States, 620
deaths per million.

1671
00:53:15.033 --> 00:53:17.199
And I know the United Kingdom
is suffering alongside

1672
00:53:17.199 --> 00:53:18.241
the United States.

1673
00:53:18.241 --> 00:53:21.533
Soto me it is very simple.

1674
00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:21.699
all

1675
00:53:21.699 --> 00:53:26.699
We have a tendency for myopia,
to think our Anglo—Saxon way

1676
00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:29.699
—— We have a tendency for myopia,
to think our Anglo—Saxon way

1677
00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:32.741
of doing things is a priori,
but I think we should be copying

1678
00:53:32.741 --> 00:53:34.908
the South Koreans right now,
and adopting their practices

1679
00:53:34.908 --> 00:53:37.324
and then you will see both
of our economies flourish.

1680
00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:37.574
tier

1681
00:53:37.574 --> 00:53:38.158
tierfrom your personal

1682
00:53:38.158 --> 00:53:38.533
tier from your personal knowledge of

1683
00:53:38.533 --> 00:53:38.991
tier from your personal knowladge of
Donald Tmmp,

1684
00:53:38.991 --> 00:53:42.241
tier from your personal knowledge of
Donald Trump, what is driving his

1685
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:42.366
Donald Tmmp, what is driving his
reaction

1686
00:53:42.366 --> 00:53:44.158
Donald Trump, what is driving his
reaction to coronavirus? Is it

1687
00:53:44.158 --> 00:53:45.033
reaction to coronavirus? Is it
purely electioneering or something

1688
00:53:45.033 --> 00:53:48.783
purely elactioneering or something
more?

1689
00:53:48.783 --> 00:53:50.449
purely electioneering or something
more? Its personality. He is the

1690
00:53:50.449 --> 00:53:52.616
more? Its personality. He is the
most insecure person you could ever

1691
00:53:52.616 --> 00:53:57.574
most insecure person you could ever
meet in your life, Fiona. He is

1692
00:53:57.574 --> 00:53:58.616
meet in your life, Fiona. He is
contrary... People telling him what

1693
00:53:58.616 --> 00:54:01.741
contrary... People telling him what
to do in front of him, he will do

1694
00:54:01.741 --> 00:54:03.241
to do in front of him, he will do
the opposite. Anthony Gauci, he will

1695
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:05.533
the opposite. Anthony Gauci, he will
do the opposite. He is insecure

1696
00:54:05.533 --> 00:54:08.366
do the opposite. He is insecure
about having expert to make him feel

1697
00:54:08.366 --> 00:54:10.158
about having expert to make him feel
inferior and so he is classically

1698
00:54:10.158 --> 00:54:11.658
inferior and so he is classically
mishandling things. I think that is

1699
00:54:11.658 --> 00:54:14.408
mishandling things. I think that is
one of the more startling things

1700
00:54:14.408 --> 00:54:16.616
one of the more startling things
about him, when you think about his

1701
00:54:16.616 --> 00:54:17.574
about him, when you think about his
ascendancy to the American

1702
00:54:17.574 --> 00:54:20.241
ascendancy to the American
presidency, but he is not somebody

1703
00:54:20.241 --> 00:54:20.783
presidency, but he is not somebody
who ran

1704
00:54:20.783 --> 00:54:21.574
presidency, but he is not somebody
who can handle conversations with

1705
00:54:21.574 --> 00:54:22.741
who ran handle conversations with
experts. He

1706
00:54:22.741 --> 00:54:23.949
who can handle conversations with
experts. He wants to run the

1707
00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:25.824
experts. He wants to run the
American presidency as a one—man

1708
00:54:25.824 --> 00:54:26.741
American presidency as a one-man
West End

1709
00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:28.699
American presidency as a one—man
West End or Broadway play. It is

1710
00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:32.074
West End or Broadway play. It is
nonsensical. So there is great

1711
00:54:32.074 --> 00:54:33.658
nonsensical. So there is great
frustration in the US. He has

1712
00:54:33.658 --> 00:54:33.824
fmstration in the US. He has
politicised

1713
00:54:33.824 --> 00:54:35.449
frustration in the US. He has
politicised the science, lied to

1714
00:54:35.449 --> 00:54:37.116
politicised the science, lied to
people about the science, and right

1715
00:54:37.116 --> 00:54:40.324
people about the science, and right
now as we are speaking he is flying

1716
00:54:40.324 --> 00:54:40.533
now as we are speaking he is ﬂying
round

1717
00:54:40.533 --> 00:54:41.783
now as we are speaking he is flying
round the battle ground states

1718
00:54:41.783 --> 00:54:43.658
round the battle ground states
creating super spreader events. Who

1719
00:54:43.658 --> 00:54:43.824
creating super spreader events. who
does

1720
00:54:43.824 --> 00:54:44.908
creating super spreader events. Who
does this? You’re talking about

1721
00:54:44.908 --> 00:54:46.866
does this? You’re talking about
leadership. One of the things both

1722
00:54:46.866 --> 00:54:49.991
leadership. One of the things both
countries need right now is direct

1723
00:54:49.991 --> 00:54:52.616
countries need right now is direct
point of honesty, and stop shading

1724
00:54:52.616 --> 00:54:54.283
point of honesty, and stop shading
things, stop spinning things, just

1725
00:54:54.283 --> 00:54:55.783
things, stop spinning things, just
say "Here are the facts, this is

what we have to do is a country. We

the president of the United States

00:55:02.741 --> 00:55:06.033
the president of the United States
has made our country sicker, weaker

to cut it out. That’s it. Bringing

1738
00:55:13.616 --> 00:55:16.616
to cut it out. That’s it. Bringing
you back to Paul’s question, Maria,

1739
00:55:16.616 --> 00:55:18.408
you back to Paul’s question, Maria,
why is the UK governments are

1740
00:55:18.408 --> 00:55:19.616
why is the UK governments are
reluctant to follow suit of places

1741
00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.616
reluctant to follow suit of places
like France and Germany going into

like France and Germany going into
various permutations of the

1743
00:55:23.199 --> 00:55:24.824
various permutations of the
lockdown? We have to remember some

1744
00:55:24.824 --> 00:55:26.491
lockdown? We have to remember some
of the countries who did really well

1745
00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:29.241
of the countries who did really well
first time around are also taking

1746
00:55:29.241 --> 00:55:31.324
first time around are also taking
emergency measures now and are in

1747
00:55:31.324 --> 00:55:34.366
emergency measures now and are in
lockdown. Here in the UK the

1748
00:55:34.366 --> 00:55:34.616
emergency measures now and are in
lockdown. Here in the UK theJewish

1749
00:55:34.616 --> 00:55:34.741
lockdown. Here in the UK the jewish
community

1750
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:36.824
lockdown. Here in the UK theJewish
community have suffered heavily with

1751
00:55:36.824 --> 00:55:39.199
community have suffered heavily with
death, as have many people from

1752
00:55:39.199 --> 00:55:39.408
death, as have many peopla from
ethnic

1753
00:55:39.408 --> 00:55:41.741
death, as have many people from
ethnic minorities. I want to commend

1754
00:55:41.741 --> 00:55:43.658
ethnic minorities. I want to commend
the report of Doreen Lawrence, and I

1755
00:55:43.658 --> 00:55:49.366
the report of Doreen Lawrence, and I
know there has been the Public

1756
00:55:49.366 --> 00:55:50.866
know there has been the Public
Health England report as well from

1757
00:55:50.866 --> 00:55:53.824
Health England report as well from
the Government. I think what has to

1758
00:55:53.824 --> 00:55:56.949
the Government. I think what has to
be sensible here is a pragmatic

1759
00:55:56.949 --> 00:55:58.783
be sensible here is a pragmatic
approach, an integrated approach. We

1760
00:55:58.783 --> 00:55:59.824
approach, an integrated approach. We
are seeing [oral

1761
00:55:59.824 --> 00:56:02.449
approach, an integrated approach. We
are seeing local lockdowns. We may

1762
00:56:02.449 --> 00:56:03.283
are seeing [oral lockdowns. We may
have to

1763
00:56:03.283 --> 00:56:04.074
are seeing local lockdowns. We may
have to see national lockdowns here,

1764
00:56:04.074 --> 00:56:06.783
have to see national lockdowns here,
but what we need is effective quick

1765
00:56:06.783 --> 00:56:08.658
but what we need is effective quick
testing and we need the track and

1766
00:56:08.658 --> 00:56:10.824
testing and we need the track and
trace up and working. We don’t want

1767
00:56:10.824 --> 00:56:13.408
trace up and working. We don’t want
it to be overwhelmed. But, yes, it

1768
00:56:13.408 --> 00:56:14.658
it to be overwhelmed. But, yes, it
does need leadership, but I can’t

1769
00:56:14.658 --> 00:56:17.658
does need leadership, but I can’t
say I am in favour of the Swedish

1770
00:56:17.658 --> 00:56:20.574
say I am in favour of the Swedish
model because... Its not working.

1771
00:56:20.574 --> 00:56:23.199
model because... Its not working.
It’s obvious. The figures seem

1772
00:56:23.199 --> 00:56:25.824
It’s obvious. The figures seem
really large in America but you have

1773
00:56:25.824 --> 00:56:28.199
really large in America but you have
to remember the population is so

1774
00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:30.824
to remember the population is so
much bigger. But we are of course

1775
00:56:30.824 --> 00:56:32.949
much bigger. But we are of course
horrified at seeing these super

1776
00:56:32.949 --> 00:56:34.741
horrified at seeing these super
spreader events. 50 there is no easy

1777
00:56:34.741 --> 00:56:35.449
spreader events. So there is no easy
answer. It’s

1778
00:56:35.449 --> 00:56:37.324
spreader events. 50 there is no easy
answer. It’s the only time I can

1779
00:56:37.324 --> 00:56:37.741
answer. It’s the only time I ran
remember

1780
00:56:37.741 --> 00:56:39.449
answer. It’s the only time I can
remember in my lifetime, though,

1781
00:56:39.449 --> 00:56:40.908
remember in my lifetime, though,
where the whole world is cooperating

1782
00:56:40.908 --> 00:56:42.658
where the whola world is cooperating
on a

1783
00:56:42.658 --> 00:56:44.199
where the whole world is cooperating
on a vaccine at least, but even that

1784
00:56:44.199 --> 00:56:46.449
on a vaccine at least, but even that
is not going to solve the problem.

1785
00:56:46.449 --> 00:56:48.241
is not going to solve the problem.
But what’s the answer? I can’t give

1786
00:56:48.241 --> 00:56:50.324
But what’s the answer? I can’t give
you that. Like Mike Billy, you are a

1787
00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.949
you that. Like Mike Billy, you are a
doctor and you speak to your

1788
00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:54.449
doctor and you speak to your
colleagues on the front line. What

1789
00:56:54.449 --> 00:56:54.783
colleagues on the front line. what
is the

1790
00:56:54.783 --> 00:56:58.033
colleagues on the front line. What
is the answer? What is your view? ——

1791
00:56:58.033 --> 00:57:00.074
is the answer? what is your view? --
well, Billy, you’re a

1792
00:57:00.074 --> 00:57:00.533
is the answer? What is your view? ——
well, Billy, you’re a doctor. I’m

1793
00:57:00.533 --> 00:57:03.241
well, Billy, you’re a doctor. I’m
afraid there is not an easy solution

1794
00:57:03.241 --> 00:57:04.866
afraid there is not an easy solution
to the current problem, and

1795
00:57:04.866 --> 00:57:05.408
to the current problam, and
certainly

1796
00:57:05.408 --> 00:57:07.158
to the current problem, and
certainly adopting the Swedish model

1797
00:57:07.158 --> 00:57:09.408
certainly adopting the Swedish model
would adversely affect the health

1798
00:57:09.408 --> 00:57:11.158
would adversely affect the health
and well—being of many NHS and

1799
00:57:11.158 --> 00:57:11.616
and well-being of many NHS and
health

1800
00:57:11.616 --> 00:57:12.991
and well—being of many NHS and
health and social care staff. Also I

1801
00:57:12.991 --> 00:57:13.491
health and social rare staff. Also I
don’t

1802
00:57:13.491 --> 00:57:14.908
health and social care staff. Also I
don’t think the test and trace

1803
00:57:14.908 --> 00:57:18.241
don’t think the test and trace
system is a solution at this point

1804
00:57:18.241 --> 00:57:20.658
system is a solution at this point
in time either. The system is most

1805
00:57:20.658 --> 00:57:22.574
in time either. The system is most
effective in the early stages of a

1806
00:57:22.574 --> 00:57:22.741
effective in the earty stages of a
pandemic.

1807
00:57:22.741 --> 00:57:24.449
effective in the early stages of a
pandemic. As case numbers rise, we

1808
00:57:24.449 --> 00:57:25.158
pandemic. As rase numbers rise, we
need to

1809
00:57:25.158 --> 00:57:26.824
pandemic. As case numbers rise, we
need to become less reliant on the

1810
00:57:26.824 --> 00:57:29.324
need to become less reliant on the
test and trace system and more

1811
00:57:29.324 --> 00:57:32.574
test and trace system and more
reliant on social distancing and

1812
00:57:32.574 --> 00:57:34.158
reliant on social distancing and
impact of lockdown measures. The

1813
00:57:34.158 --> 00:57:36.074
impact of lockdown measures. The
problem is the rate of infection

1814
00:57:36.074 --> 00:57:38.408
problem is the rate of infection
rises beyond the capacity of the

1815
00:57:38.408 --> 00:57:41.408
rises beyond the capacity of the
test and trace system quite quickly.

1816
00:57:41.408 --> 00:57:41.783
test and trace system quite quickly.
But, Nick,

1817
00:57:41.783 --> 00:57:41.949
test and trace system quite quickly.
Butt, Nick, can

1818
00:57:41.949 --> 00:57:42.158
test and trace system quite quickly.
Butt, Nick, canl

1819
00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.324
test and trace system quite quickly.
Butt, Nick, can I let you come back

1820
00:57:43.324 --> 00:57:43.949
Butt, Nick, ran I let you come back
in, because we

1821
00:57:43.949 --> 00:57:46.033
Butt, Nick, can I let you come back
in, because we lost you for a bit

1822
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:51.449
in, because we lost you for a bit
before you managed to finish your

1823
00:57:51.449 --> 00:57:52.116
before you managed to finish your
point -- But,

1824
00:57:52.116 --> 00:57:53.908
before you managed to finish your
point —— But, Nick. Thank you. Not

1825
00:57:53.908 --> 00:57:55.408
point -- But, Nick. Thank you. Not
sure what

1826
00:57:55.408 --> 00:57:56.116
point —— But, Nick. Thank you. Not
sure what happened there, but Chris

1827
00:57:56.116 --> 00:57:57.574
sure what happened there, but Chris
mentions the threat to the economy

1828
00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:58.741
mentions the threat to the economy
and the biggest threat to the

1829
00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:00.574
and the biggest threat to the
economy is a virus we are not on top

1830
00:58:00.574 --> 00:58:02.199
economy is a virus we are not on top
of and is out of control. To

1831
00:58:02.199 --> 00:58:02.908
economy is a virus we are not on top
of and is out of control. To get it

1832
00:58:02.908 --> 00:58:04.574
of and is out of control. To get it
under control the obviously need the

1833
00:58:04.574 --> 00:58:06.741
under control the obviously need the
testing system but we need the

1834
00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:08.574
testing system but we need the
tracing system, and to have an

1835
00:58:08.574 --> 00:58:09.741
tracing system, and to have an
effective tracing system you need to

1836
00:58:09.741 --> 00:58:12.658
effective tracing system you need to
be tracing over 80% of contacts.

1837
00:58:12.658 --> 00:58:12.991
be tracing over 8096 of contacts.
Here in

1838
00:58:12.991 --> 00:58:15.949
be tracing over 80% of contacts.
Here in Wales with an 80% system we

1839
00:58:15.949 --> 00:58:16.574
Here in Walas with an 8096 system we
are over

1840
00:58:16.574 --> 00:58:17.116
Here in Wales with an 80% system we
are over that figure but

1841
00:58:17.116 --> 00:58:18.616
are over that figure but
unfortunately it is not the case in

1842
00:58:18.616 --> 00:58:18.949
unfortunately it is not the use in
England and

1843
00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:19.949
unfortunately it is not the case in
England and the reason we are

1844
00:58:19.949 --> 00:58:21.491
England and the reason we are
arguing for that circuit breaker in

1845
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:23.866
arguing for that circuit breaker in
England is to give that opportunity

1846
00:58:23.866 --> 00:58:26.783
England is to give that opportunity
to get that system to work. But

1847
00:58:26.783 --> 00:58:29.449
to get that system to work. But
also, too, to be clear, we are not

1848
00:58:29.449 --> 00:58:30.658
also, too, to be clear, we are not
suggesting in that scenario

1849
00:58:30.658 --> 00:58:31.116
also, too, to be clear, we are not
suggesting in that scenario schools

1850
00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:32.616
suggesting in that scenario schools
should close. We should all be

1851
00:58:32.616 --> 00:58:34.199
should close. We should all be
trying to keep schools open because

1852
00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:36.533
trying to keep schools open because
we know the damage it does to

1853
00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:39.449
we know the damage it does to
educational attainment for children

1854
00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:40.866
educational attainment for children
being out of school. But the reality

1855
00:58:40.866 --> 00:58:42.783
being out of school. But the reality
is we are in the situation in

1856
00:58:42.783 --> 00:58:43.866
is we are in the situation in
England where the Government has

1857
00:58:43.866 --> 00:58:45.783
England where the Government has
lost control of the virus and time

1858
00:58:45.783 --> 00:58:46.866
lost control of the virus and time
is slipping away for them to

1859
00:58:46.866 --> 00:58:48.408
is slipping away for them to
actually take this measure of

1860
00:58:48.408 --> 00:58:49.741
actually take this measure of
getting a circuit breaker in place

1861
00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:51.408
getting a circuit breaker in place
to try to get back in control and

1862
00:58:51.408 --> 00:58:53.491
to try to get back in control and
back on top of testing. But

1863
00:58:53.491 --> 00:58:54.449
to try to get back in control and
back on top of testing. Butjust

1864
00:58:54.449 --> 00:58:55.158
back on top of testing. But just
before you

1865
00:58:55.158 --> 00:58:55.991
back on top of testing. Butjust
before you we heard Billy saying

1866
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:57.824
before you we heard Billy saying
once you get to a certain level of

1867
00:58:57.824 --> 00:58:59.824
once you get to a certain level of
numbers of cases test and trace

1868
00:58:59.824 --> 00:59:02.616
numbers of cases test and trace
becomes less effective and easily

1869
00:59:02.616 --> 00:59:03.658
becomes less effective and easily
becomes overwhelmed, and in Wales

1870
00:59:03.658 --> 00:59:05.199
becomes overwhelmed, and in Wales
where there is a greater success

1871
00:59:05.199 --> 00:59:06.908
where there is a greater success
with that nonetheless cases are

1872
00:59:06.908 --> 00:59:08.991
with that nonetheless rases are
going up?

1873
00:59:08.991 --> 00:59:10.158
going up?
Well, yes, cases are on

1874
00:59:10.158 --> 00:59:10.616
going up?
Well, yes, rases are on the rise,

1875
00:59:10.616 --> 00:59:11.783
Well, yes, rases are on the rise,
and that is why

1876
00:59:11.783 --> 00:59:13.616
Well, yes, cases are on the rise,
and that is why we have taken the

1877
00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:14.199
and that is why we have taken the
measure we have.

1878
00:59:14.199 --> 00:59:17.158
measure we have.
That measure came into place last

1879
00:59:17.158 --> 00:59:20.158
That measure came into place last
Friday. It will be for 17 days and

1880
00:59:20.158 --> 00:59:21.824
Friday. It will be for 17 days and
obviously then, as we come out of

1881
00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.616
obviously then, as we come out of
it, we will see what the impact of

1882
00:59:23.616 --> 00:59:27.033
it, we will see what the impact of
that has been. But I think taking

1883
00:59:27.033 --> 00:59:28.116
that has been. But I think taking
the diligent, cautious approach that

1884
00:59:28.116 --> 00:59:30.824
the diligent, cautious approach that
has defined the approach to the

1885
00:59:30.824 --> 00:59:32.491
has defined the approach to the
virus with the leadership of Mark

1886
00:59:32.491 --> 00:59:34.074
virus with the leadership of Mark
Drakeford here in Wales has been the

1887
00:59:34.074 --> 00:59:34.199
Drakeford here in Wales has been the
“Y

1888
00:59:34.199 --> 00:59:35.616
Drakeford here in Wales has been the
way to approach it, and the reality

1889
00:59:35.616 --> 00:59:37.866
way to approach it, and the reality
is with the tiered system in England

1890
00:59:37.866 --> 00:59:38.574
is with the tiered system in England
I’m afraid it’s

1891
00:59:38.574 --> 00:59:38.783
is with the tiered system in England
I’m afraid it’sjust

1892
00:59:38.783 --> 00:59:41.158
is with the tiered system in England
I’m afraid it’s just not the case

1893
00:59:41.158 --> 00:59:41.324
I’m afraid it’s just not the rase
that

1894
00:59:41.324 --> 00:59:42.366
I’m afraid it’s just not the case
that areas are permanently coming

1895
00:59:42.366 --> 00:59:43.991
that areas are permanently coming
out of the restrictions or the

1896
00:59:43.991 --> 00:59:46.158
out of the restrictions or the
tiers. These figures are very sadly

1897
00:59:46.158 --> 00:59:47.699
tiers. These figures are very sadly
going in one direction, and I want

1898
00:59:47.699 --> 00:59:49.366
going in one direction, and I want
to see the Government in England

1899
00:59:49.366 --> 00:59:51.783
to see the Government in England
getting on top of the virus in the

getting on top of the virus in the
“Y

1901
00:59:51.949 --> 00:59:53.949
getting on top of the virus in the
way we are attempting to do so in

1902
00:59:53.949 --> 00:59:54.366
way we are attempting to do so in
Walas.

1903
00:59:54.366 --> 00:59:56.241
way we are attempting to do so in
Wales. You ask the question. Do you

1904
00:59:56.241 --> 00:59:56.449
Walas. You ask the question. Do you
want

1905
00:59:56.449 --> 00:59:59.616
Wales. You ask the question. Do you
want the last word, Paul? Thank you,

want the last word, Paul? Thank you,
yes. I

yes. I lost my father and my wife

1909
01:00:05.616 --> 01:00:08.158
yes. I lost my father and my wife
both to long—standing health issues

1910
01:00:08.158 --> 01:00:09.533
both to long-standing health issues
in 2019.

1911
01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:10.991
both to long—standing health issues
in 2019. I’m so sorry. I actually

1912
01:00:10.991 --> 01:00:13.241
in 2019. I’m so sorry. I actually
feel fortunate that they died last

1913
01:00:13.241 --> 01:00:16.574
feel fortunate that they died last
year, because we were able to give

1914
01:00:16.574 --> 01:00:17.949
year, because we were able to give
them dignified and fitting funerals.

1915
01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:24.699
them dignified and fitting funerals.
The families of almost 16,000

1916

The families of almost 46,000
victims,

1917

The families of almost 16,000
victims, and you are broadcasting

1918
01:00:26.283 --> 01:00:27.699
victims, and you are broadcasting
from Lincoln, that is half the

1919
01:00:27.699 --> 01:00:29.991
from Lincoln, that is half the
population of Lincoln. Go onto

1920
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:33.991
population of Lincoln. Go onto
Lincoln high Street whenever and

1921

Lincoln high Street whenever and
every other person you see, that is

1922
01:00:35.491 --> 01:00:41.741
every other person you see, that is
the level of people who have died.

the level of people who have died.
Anything, a

1924

the level of people who have died.
Anything, 3 second national

Anything, 3 second national
lockdown, it only risks 3 similar

number

number of families suffering this
heartache... You cannot be at your

1929
01:00:51.783 --> 01:00:53.533
heartache... You cannot be at your
loved one’s bedside when they have

1930
01:00:53.533 --> 01:00:54.991
loved one’s bedside when they have
their last breath, you can’t even

1931
01:00:54.991 --> 01:00:57.449
their last breath, you can’t even
give them a fitting and dignified

1932
01:00:57.449 --> 01:00:59.241
give them a fitting and dignified
sendoff. It is appalling and it

1933
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:02.741
sendoff. It is appalling and it
needs to happen now. Tonight, from

1934

needs to happen now. Tonight, from
half past ten, half past ten. Not

half past ten, half past ten. Not
three weeks in the future. It needs

1936
01:01:09.574 --> 01:01:12.074
three weeks in the future. It needs
to happen now. You have made your

1937
01:01:12.074 --> 01:01:13.616
to happen now. You have made your
point, Paul, and I’m so sorry for

1994
01:04:55.824 --> 01:05:00.033
These lockdown days have been hard
for all of us.

1995
01:05:00.033 --> 01:05:03.616
But imagine being stuck in a house —
seven brothers and sisters

1996
01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:05.574
and one of their mates —

1997
01:05:05.574 --> 01:05:07.241
it could be total hell.

1998
01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:11.408
But not for them.

1999
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:14.158
This is a house like no other.
