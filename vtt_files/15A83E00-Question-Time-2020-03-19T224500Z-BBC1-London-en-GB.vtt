1
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.114
On that note, let’s turn our
thoughts to those on the front line

2
00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:07.864
trying to protect Londoners
during this pandemic,

3
00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:12.031
and to whom we are most grateful.

4
00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:15.447
We’ve just heard the Wembley Stadium
march has been lit up blue and it

5
00:00:15.447 --> 00:00:18.031
march has been lit up blue and it
will be every night to shine a

6
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:18.447
march has been lit up blue and it
will be every night to shine alight

7
00:00:18.447 --> 00:00:19.197
will be every night to shine a light
on the

8
00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:21.156
will be every night to shine alight
on the work of the NHS and front

9
00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:21.906
on the work of the NHS and front
line staff.

10
00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:24.031
London Ambulance has told us
it’s been the busiest

11
00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:25.072
time in their history.

12
00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:27.531
Karl Mercer has being hearing
from paramedics and call handlers

13
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:29.697
as health workers adapt
to a rapidly changing situation.

14
00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:31.072
Emergency ambulance,
is the patient breathing?

15
00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.531
Emergency ambulance,
is the patient breathing?

16
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.031
Emergency ambulance,
is the patient breathing?

17
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:36.156
They’re answering calls
in the normal way, but this

18
00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.239
is not business as usual
for London’s Ambulance Service.

19
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.739
Just to confirm, is she awake?

20
00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.364
They’re dealing with more cells
than ever in their history.

21
00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:47.072
It’s been very busy, very busy,
over the last few days.

22
00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:51.489
We’ve got calls waiting,
people waiting to get through.

23
00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.239
holding, all across London,

24
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.656
people who we’ve triaged
and are waiting for ambulances,

25
00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:04.697
and we’ve got people right now
waiting to get through.

26
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.489
Stressful, stressful.

27
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.031
It’s been very busy over
the last three to four weeks

28
00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:11.739
now, getting busier.

29
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.781
And it’s very demanding
on all our staff at the moment.

30
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.072
It’s very stressful
for them right now.

31
00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:20.322
Like many of the emergency services,
they are stretched.

32
00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:23.614
Some staff have had to self—isolate,
others will have to go home to look

33
00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:24.614
after theirfamilies.

34
00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:26.989
Still, the calls will come.

35
00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:29.739
Unprecedented times,
staff working incredibly hard.

36
00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:33.322
We’vejust had our three busiest
days ever in 999 call answering.

37
00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.281
Nearly 8,000 calls on each
of the last three days,

38
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:39.031
that’s up from a normal busy day
of about 5,000 calls.

39
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.697
And in the 111 service,
call volumes three and four times

40
00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:44.239
as high as they would be.

41
00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.239
50, really challenging times,
we’re working incredibly hard

42
00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.739
to answer as many queries as we can,
but our real strong advice to people

43
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.281
is, if you can avoid phoning,
absolutely do not phone 999

44
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:58.614
unless it’s a really
life—threatening emergency.

45
00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:01.947
They’ve called on former workers
to get in touch if they can help out

46
00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:05.156
and have also had to adapt
to new ways of working.

47
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:07.322
Hi, I’m Ben, I’m 26,
I’ve been a paramedic

48
00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:08.822
for two and a half years.

49
00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:11.447
With recent events, there’s been
some changes to how we’re working,

50
00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:13.364
particularly with PPE,
the kit that we’re wearing.

51
00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:16.489
So, we’lljump on board now and I’ll
show you what we’re doing.

52
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.989
SIREN SOUNDS.

53
00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.406
So, some of the things
that we are using...

54
00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:24.822
For cases that are confirmed,
all we would have to use

55
00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:27.614
specific procedures,
you may see us wearing these big

56
00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:32.864
white suits and goggles
and a special facemask.

57
00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:36.822
Otherwise, if the patient calls
and they think they might

58
00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:39.947
have symptoms consistent
with coronavirus, what you will

59
00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:44.531
often see is us wearing an apron,
as normal, surgical mask and two

60
00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:45.697
pairs of gloves.

61
00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:48.489
Don’t be alarmed, it might look
a little bit much but it’s

62
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.197
entirely precautionary.

63
00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:52.906
And then the patients that we’re
going to in these buildings,

64
00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.531
where they live, they’re not
particularly unwell,

65
00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:57.114
we’re often leaving them at home.

66
00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:59.572
So, if you do see this,
don’t worry at all.

67
00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:01.906
You might see it more
in the days to come,

68
00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:03.364
but it’s nothing to worry about.

69
00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:04.572
Tell me about what’s happening.

70
00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.947
A message of reassurance
in difficult times for those helping

71
00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.031
to keep Londoners safe.

72
00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:13.489
Karl Mercer, BBC London.

73
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:13.739
m:

74
00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.822
We are most grateful to them.

75
00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:17.322
We are most grateful to them.

76
00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.197
Now, whilst schools closing
tomorrow has left many

77
00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:20.947
parents with questions,
there are some Londoners

78
00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:23.739
who are already coming to the rescue
with how to keep children

79
00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:24.822
entertained while at home.

80
00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:26.739
Here’s Caroline Davies
with some of them —

81
00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.906
including a well—known Dame and some
kids in Enfield.

82
00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:31.572
All the children on our road,
including me, have made this

83
00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:34.447
rainbow, so when people walk by,
they can smile and know that

84
00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.739
there’s hope even though
the coronavirus is here.

85
00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:41.947
Colouring to keep everyone cheerful.

86
00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:44.072
In Enfield, children have put out
pictures of rainbows

87
00:03:44.072 --> 00:03:48.947
for others to spot and count
on neighbourhood walks.

88
00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.781
A very simple U—shape, like that.

89
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:57.447
One Londoner is also offering online
art classes for free.

90
00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:01.781
Drawing is something that has been
around since time immemorial.

91
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:04.864
It’s like one of the nicest
and easiest things that we can do.

92
00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:07.489
And because we do it,
as you saw in the video,

93
00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.156
a little tiny bit at a time,
it’s something that’s very

94
00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:12.072
attainable and, you know,
people are really surprised

95
00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:16.281
with the results that they get,
so, it’s lovely to see.

96
00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:19.864
Paul and Simon usually run drama
workshops in school.

97
00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:22.822
With them closed, they’re
offering drama games online.

98
00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:26.156
We will share kind of a two—minute
video every day, and it will be

99
00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:29.656
a drama game or a drama activity
that families can do at home.

100
00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:32.197
So, whether it’s literacy, history,
geography, you can use

101
00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:35.822
drama in all of those.

102
00:04:35.822 --> 00:04:38.906
Just trying to keep the flame
burning, really, make it a bit more

103
00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:41.281
exciting and playful for people
who are at home in

104
00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.322
this stressful time.

105
00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:45.697
And in these uncertain times,
there are also plenty offering

106
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:48.656
just a bit of silliness.

107
00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:49.739
0h!

108
00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:50.697
There you are!

109
00:04:50.697 --> 00:04:52.531
Just keep laughing.

110
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:58.906
That’s all we can do.

111
00:04:58.906 --> 00:04:59.989
Listen to Dame Judi.

112
00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:03.114
And we’ll try and bring you more
of those positive stories every day.

113
00:05:03.114 --> 00:05:06.197
If you want to tell us how your
community is helping each other,

114
00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:09.322
share it on your local BBC radio
station which has Make A Difference

115
00:05:09.364 --> 00:05:12.906
stories throughout the day.

116
00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:16.031
And of course I know I’ve said it
before but it’s worth repeating,

117
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.656
with advice being updated
all the time — get the latest,

118
00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.322
more importantly the facts
about coronavirus —

119
00:05:20.322 --> 00:05:24.156
on our website, Facebook
and the BBC News app.

120
00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:26.989
I’ll wish you goodnight
now and leave you with

121
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.906
Stav Danaos for the weather.

122
00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:33.197
Hello there.

123
00:05:33.197 --> 00:05:35.864
We’ve got one more day of grey,
damp weather before conditions

124
00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:38.031
really improve into the weekend
with plenty of sunshine.

125
00:05:38.031 --> 00:05:41.114
So tonight is going to be cloudy
as well like it was today.

126
00:05:41.114 --> 00:05:44.031
That cloud thick enough for some
spots of light rain and drizzle.

127
00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:46.156
But with the cloud cover,
temperatures shouldn’t fall much

128
00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:48.572
below 4 or 5 degrees
for the most of us.

129
00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:51.947
Now, as we head on into tomorrow,
it’s going to be another grey day,

130
00:05:51.947 --> 00:05:54.072
the cloud thick enough again
for some light rain

131
00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:56.739
and drizzle in places,
and it will also feel quite chilly

132
00:05:56.781 --> 00:05:57.947
in a brisk north—easterly wind.

133
00:05:57.947 --> 00:06:00.322
Those temperatures reaching highs
of 8—10 degrees in the capital.

134
00:06:00.322 --> 00:06:02.531
Then into the weekend, then,
plenty of sunshine around

135
00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:05.114
thanks to high pressure,
but it will be chilly with quite

136
00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:08.239
a fresh easterly breeze and it stays
fine into next week as well.

137
00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:13.531
Stay tuned now for your national
weather with Chris Fawkes.

138
00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:29.489
Hello. We had some big contrasts in
the weather across the UK. Again, it

139
00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.031
the weather across the UK. Again, it
was northern areas that had the best

140
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:32.239
was northern areas that had the best
of the days

141
00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:33.322
was northern areas that had the best
of the day’s sunshine, some

142
00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:34.947
of the day’s sunshine, some
beautiful skies there over the snow

143
00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:36.531
beautiful skies there over the snow
covered mountains in Scotland but it

144
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:38.364
covered mountains in Scotland but it
wasn’t like that everywhere. Further

145
00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:39.572
wasn’t like that everywhere. Further
south we’ve had this pesky weather

146
00:06:39.572 --> 00:06:42.031
south we’ve had this pesky weather
front for a number of days, low

147
00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:44.156
front for a number of days, low
cloud, damp, drizzly weather. It

148
00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:45.072
cloud, damp, driuly weather. It
only got to 5

149
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.031
cloud, damp, drizzly weather. It
only got to 5 degrees in South Wales

150
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.281
only got to 5 degrees in South Wales
so quite chilly as well. That front

151
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.156
so quite chilly as well. That front
is still with us. It’s going nowhere

152
00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:53.031
is still with us. It’s going nowhere
fast. It stays grey, mist, hill fog

153
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:54.697
fast. It stays grey, mist, hill fog
patches, patches of rain and

154
00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:54.864
patches, patches of rain and
drizzla,

155
00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:55.781
patches, patches of rain and
drizzle, but not particularly cold

156
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:56.197
drizzla, but not particularty cold
across

157
00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:58.447
drizzle, but not particularly cold
across the South of England and

158
00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:00.822
across the South of England and
South Wales. Temperatures 5—6d.

159
00:07:00.822 --> 00:07:01.031
South Walas. Temperatures 5-6d.
Further

160
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:02.739
South Wales. Temperatures 5—6d.
Further north of the frost is more

161
00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:04.406
Further north of the frost is more
widespread and sharp as well,

162
00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:06.322
widespread and sharp as well,
temperatures get down to about —6 or

163
00:07:06.322 --> 00:07:07.239
temperatures get down to about -6 or
-7 in the

164
00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.864
temperatures get down to about —6 or
—7 in the coldest parts of Scotland.

165
00:07:09.864 --> 00:07:10.156
-7 in the coldest parts of Scotland.
Tomorrow,

166
00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:11.739
—7 in the coldest parts of Scotland.
Tomorrow, this area of high pressure

167
00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:13.072
Tomorrow, this area of high pressure
strengthens. This area of low

168
00:07:13.072 --> 00:07:14.197
strengthens. This area of low
pressure deepens and the result is

169
00:07:14.197 --> 00:07:17.781
pressure deepens and the result is
we get the stronger winds blowing

170
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:19.781
we get the stronger winds blowing
across England and in particular

171
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:20.781
across England and in particular
around the headlands of south—west

172
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:21.281
around the headlands of south-west
England. I

173
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:22.239
around the headlands of south—west
England. I think here we could get

174
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:24.239
England. I think here we could get
gusts of around A0 miles an hour or

175
00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:25.031
gusts of around 40 mils an hour or
so, but a

176
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:25.364
gusts of around 40 mils an hour or
so, buta pretty

177
00:07:25.364 --> 00:07:26.322
gusts of around A0 miles an hour or
so, but a pretty cold wind for

178

so, but a pretty cold wind for
Walas, the

00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:27.947
so, but a pretty cold wind for
Wales, the Midlands and East Anglia.

180
00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:28.322
Walas, the Midlands and East Anglia.
Away from

181
00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:29.739
Wales, the Midlands and East Anglia.
Away from the south it stays quite

182
00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:31.989
Away from the south it stays quite
drizzly, even into the afternoon.

183
00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:34.531
drizzly, even into the afternoon.
Across many areas it’s a dry day, a

184
00:07:34.531 --> 00:07:36.614
Across many areas it’s a dry day, a
few isolated light show is coming

few isolated light show is coming

186
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:38.281
and going across the north-east of
England

and going across the north—east of
England although there won’t be many

England although there won’t be many

dry weekend. However, the amount of
cloud will vary from

194
00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:48.989
We’re going back to Afghan.

195
00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:50.781
It’s a lot of new faces
that need bedding in.

196
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:52.656
THEY SHOUT
It was yourfault!

197
00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:54.031
They’re targeting the hospital.

198
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.572
My fiance was killed
on a mission to get Omar.

199
00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:03.364
The same warlord who killed
your husband is now targeting you.

200
00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:06.364
# Oh, I let my lover go

201
00:08:06.364 --> 00:08:08.697
# Didn’t wanna be a liar

202
00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.531
# Ashes in the cold

203
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:13.739
# Now I’m running toward the fire

204
00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:17.739
# Runnin’ toward,
runnin’ toward the fire... #

205
00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:19.739
Just keep being reminded of Elvis.

206
00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:21.864
I don’t think
I can do this any more.

207
00:08:27.197 --> 00:08:28.822
WORP!
Ready?

208
00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:30.364
Let’s go.

209
00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:36.239
Argh!
SCREAMING

210
00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:37.364
Snap!

211
00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:40.322
Ha! You missed me, right?

212
00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:41.739
I’m the Doctor. What?

213
00:08:41.739 --> 00:08:43.031
BOTH: What?

214
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:46.031
Everything is about to change.
SHE CLICKS HER FINGERS

215
00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:47.364
I know you think I’m mad,

216
00:08:47.364 --> 00:08:50.156
but give me five minutes and you’ll
think I’m the sanest person alive.

217
00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:51.531
OK, that was an overstatement.

218
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.697
Every episode, every adventure.

219
00:08:53.697 --> 00:08:56.614
The 13th Doctor —
only on BBC iPlayer.

220
00:08:57.989 --> 00:09:00.864
It’s an extraordinary ask,
isn’t it, to, um...

221
00:09:00.864 --> 00:09:03.156
..bear a child for someone?

222
00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:06.531
This is something I want to do.

223
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:09.197
I can change your life
and you can change mine.

224
00:09:09.197 --> 00:09:12.489
Using an 18—year—old fresh out of
a children’s home? Jesus, Emily!

225
00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:14.364
Well, I’m doing it,
with or without you.

226
00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:21.406
This lassie has keyed into you,
and you’re not thinking straight.

227
00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:25.781
It’s exploitation, pure and simple.

228
00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:29.364
Daniel Docherty, he’s called.
Minted! Owns half of Glasgow.

229
00:09:31.114 --> 00:09:34.322
Something’s not right.
She’s got all the power,

230
00:09:34.322 --> 00:09:36.489
but we’ve no choice
but to trust her.

231
00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:39.697
What have you told them?

232
00:09:39.697 --> 00:09:42.239
The lassie’s story doesnae add up.

233
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:45.114
Do you hear that wee voice
in your head?

234
00:09:45.114 --> 00:09:47.697
Well, my one’s saying,
"We can do this."

235
00:09:47.697 --> 00:09:49.864
SHE SCREAMS

236
00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:51.197
ECHOES: Do this...

237
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.197
Oi, come here!

238
00:10:20.697 --> 00:10:21.864
Oi, come here!

239
00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:38.031
You’re. . . nicked.

240
00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:48.197
Who’s the one that got him?

241
00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.197
Back to what you were doing, Sandra.

242
00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:03.697
You can’t touch that one,
she’s Mr Pullman’s daughter.

243
00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:07.864
I like a bit of danger.
Then I’ve got all you can handle.

244
00:11:07.864 --> 00:11:12.614
I’m DCI Ackroyd. You’ve heard of me?
Yes, guv.

245
00:11:12.614 --> 00:11:14.406
You like being a cop?

246
00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:20.281
Yes, guv. You want a transfer
to my team? Yes, I do.

247
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:24.239
Then it’s done. Welcome aboard,
Detective Sergeant Standing.

248
00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.739
He’s here, Gerry.

249
00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:49.947
Still got it.

250
00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.114
# It’s all right
It’s OK

251
00:11:57.114 --> 00:11:59.947
# Doesn’t really matter
if you’re old and grey

252
00:11:59.947 --> 00:12:02.614
# It’s all right
I say it’s OK

253
00:12:02.614 --> 00:12:05.656
# Listen to what I say

254
00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:08.072
# It’s all right, doing fine

255
00:12:08.072 --> 00:12:10.906
# Doesn’t really matter
if the sun don’t shine

256
00:12:10.906 --> 00:12:13.781
# It’s all right
I say it’s OK

257
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:16.406
# We’re gettin’
to the end of the day. #

258
00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:23.656
Well, can’t your mum do it?

259
00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:25.322
Gone where?

260
00:12:25.322 --> 00:12:26.864
Has she, indeed? Who with?

261
00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:31.864
No, no, no, but it’s all right for
some, isn’t it?

262
00:12:31.864 --> 00:12:35.572
Well, listen, what about
what’s—her—name from next door?

263
00:12:35.572 --> 00:12:38.072
Caitlin, just because someone
has a drink now and again

264
00:12:38.072 --> 00:12:40.656
it doesn’t make them an alc...

265
00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:41.697
0h.

266
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:44.822
Yeah, no, that is quite a lot, yeah.

267
00:12:46.864 --> 00:12:50.072
Yeah, OK then, but you’ll have to
lay it all out for me.

268
00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:54.697
Yeah, but not for over 30 years.
All the gear’s different, isn’t it?

269
00:12:54.697 --> 00:12:57.322
OK, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Everything all right, Gerry?

270
00:12:57.322 --> 00:13:00.197
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, guv’nor,
can I have tomorrow off?

271
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:02.406
Caitlin’s got to work
and her husband’s away at some

272
00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:05.114
conference, so they need someone to
look after the little’un.

273
00:13:05.114 --> 00:13:07.156
Can we spare you, Gerry,
is the question.

274
00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:10.697
What if we find ourselves in another
high—speed pursuit like yesterday?

275
00:13:10.697 --> 00:13:12.656
She’s trusting you all day
with her baby?

276
00:13:12.656 --> 00:13:15.197
Yeah, we should probably put
social services on alert.

277
00:13:15.197 --> 00:13:18.197
He’s asleep most of the time.
Like grandfather like grandson.

278
00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:20.364
0h. Trouble?

279
00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:23.781
Internet dating.

280
00:13:23.781 --> 00:13:26.614
And I’m saying that out loud because
it’s nothing to be ashamed of

281
00:13:26.614 --> 00:13:29.739
and I don’t need you three giggling
about it behind my back because I am

282
00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:32.781
not looking at three men here who’ve
made unimpeachable life choices.

283
00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:36.197
No, I think it’s...great. Yeah,
good for you, you get out there.

284
00:13:38.906 --> 00:13:40.322
Fine, then.

285
00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.572
What happened to the bloke who
took her to Barcelona?

286
00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:47.447
What goes on in Barcelona, Gerry,
stays in Barcelona.

287
00:13:47.447 --> 00:13:49.781
And he did stay in Barcelona...

288
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:53.197
with a 25—year—old
occupational therapist.

289
00:13:53.197 --> 00:13:54.822
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

290
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:58.614
Hiya.

291
00:14:00.322 --> 00:14:03.072
Guv’nor, if they only found
this body a few hours ago,

292
00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:04.447
what’s it got to do with Ucos?

293
00:14:04.447 --> 00:14:06.989
The murder investigation
teams are all up to their eyes,

294
00:14:06.989 --> 00:14:09.406
so Strickland wants us
to baby—sit until he can assign it.

295
00:14:09.406 --> 00:14:11.864
Baby—sitting’s very much
Gerry’s forte.

296
00:14:11.864 --> 00:14:14.197
This one’s even less
likely to wake up.

297
00:14:14.197 --> 00:14:17.364
The body’s been here for about
30 years, they reckon.
Who owns the house?

298
00:14:17.364 --> 00:14:20.989
A Russian billionaire bought it six
months ago for seven million quid.

299
00:14:20.989 --> 00:14:22.031
Thanks.

300
00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:26.406
He’s having the whole place
gutted and rebuilt.

301
00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:28.697
When was the last time you
changed a nappy?

302
00:14:28.697 --> 00:14:30.281
It’s like riding a bike, isn’t it?

303
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:31.989
When’s the last time you
rode a bike?

304
00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:36.697
How hard can it be? You’ve never
changed a nappy, have you?

305
00:14:36.697 --> 00:14:39.072
It’s a generational thing. Is it?

306
00:14:39.072 --> 00:14:42.239
My wife and I took it in turns.
Yeah, well, that’s a Scottish thing.

307
00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:44.989
No, it isn’t.
How many children have you had?

308
00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:46.489
How many wives, more to the point.

309
00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:49.322
Well, if any of you wants to come
round and give us a hand, feel free.

310
00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:52.197
No, I’d much ratherjust sit back
and watch you try and figure it out.

311
00:14:52.197 --> 00:14:53.406
I’ll bring some popcorn.

312
00:14:53.406 --> 00:14:56.906
And on that neat segue,
this is going to be a cinema room.

313
00:14:56.906 --> 00:14:59.864
Oh, I see what you did there.
It’ll be nice when it’s finished.

314
00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:02.281
Workmen have been digging it
out for the past few days.

315
00:15:02.281 --> 00:15:05.239
Overnight the water pump failed
and when they got in this morning,

316
00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:08.906
water had seeped up into
the hole and this came with it.

317
00:15:08.906 --> 00:15:11.614
What had he done to the house?
Could it predate the house?

318
00:15:11.614 --> 00:15:12.906
It’s not likely.

319
00:15:14.406 --> 00:15:16.031
A Signet ring.
It was found on the body.

320
00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.989
Came off him in one of the workmen’s
hands as he tried to pull the thing

321
00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:21.864
out of the water before he realised
what it was he’d grabbed hold of.

322
00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:24.031
He’s going to be having some
colourful nightmares.

323
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:25.739
More 19705 than Nth—century.

324
00:15:25.739 --> 00:15:27.531
Does anyone need anything from here?

325
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:29.822
Scene Of Crime are going to run
an ultrasound and see

326
00:15:29.822 --> 00:15:32.156
if there’s anything else where
the body came from. Dan?

327
00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:34.656
Well, it’s 30 years on,
the builders have gutted the place,

328
00:15:34.656 --> 00:15:36.197
so there’s nothing for me.

329
00:15:37.364 --> 00:15:42.531
Steve? No. Gerry? No.

330
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:45.281
Better get used to handling
unpleasant things in bags, Gerry.

331
00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:46.906
Yeah.

332
00:15:59.447 --> 00:16:01.781
Everything all right, Gerry? Eh?

333
00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:04.406
You seem a bit away with
the fairies today.

334
00:16:04.406 --> 00:16:06.906
Well, it’s nerves, big day tomorrow.

335
00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:08.447
Hey, why don’t you take the baby

336
00:16:08.447 --> 00:16:10.614
to one of those
mother-and-baby screenings, eh?

337
00:16:10.614 --> 00:16:15.031
Meet some yummy mummies.
Yummy grannies.

338
00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:17.489
Here we go, 30 years ago,

339
00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.156
that house belonged to a guy
called Richard Lloyd Owen.

340
00:16:20.156 --> 00:16:23.697
He bought it in 1972,
sold it again in 1987.

341
00:16:23.697 --> 00:16:26.031
Why are we bothering with this?
What do you mean?

342
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:27.781
Well, it’s not our case, is it?

343
00:16:27.781 --> 00:16:29.781
Like Sasha said,
we’re baby—sitting it,

344
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.822
it’ll be taken off our hands
in a day or so.

345
00:16:31.822 --> 00:16:34.114
Yeah, but whila we’ve got it,
you know...

346
00:16:34.114 --> 00:16:37.739
Yes, needs to be fed, winded,
taken for a nice walk in the park.

347
00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:40.906
Doesn’t look like Lloyd Owen
lived in it after 1976,

348
00:16:40.906 --> 00:16:43.281
it was standing empty.
Maybe the killers broke in.

349
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:45.197
No, those houses were pretty close
together.

350
00:16:45.197 --> 00:16:47.072
If someone was going to dig up
the basement

351
00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:49.364
of an empty house,
a neighbour would have heard.

352
00:16:49.364 --> 00:16:51.489
Well, maybe
if it didn’t seem suspicious,

353
00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:53.239
if there was building works
going on...

354
00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:56.364
I’ll check the planning department.
These houses are listed,

355
00:16:56.364 --> 00:16:57.572
you’d need permission.

356
00:16:57.572 --> 00:16:58.906
We have a development.

357
00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:04.031
When they pulled that body
out of the water,

358
00:17:04.031 --> 00:17:07.281
they found something tangled
up in what was left of his clothes.

359
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:16.531
Detective Chief Inspector
Martin Ackroyd. 0h, Jesus.

360
00:17:16.531 --> 00:17:18.864
Gerry? Is it definitely him?

361
00:17:18.864 --> 00:17:20.531
Dental records are a match.

362
00:17:24.614 --> 00:17:26.489
Why are we looking at Gerry?

363
00:17:26.489 --> 00:17:30.031
Because Gerry was working under
DCI Ackroyd when he went missing.

364
00:17:30.031 --> 00:17:32.322
Yeah,
but I’d only just been transferred.

365
00:17:32.322 --> 00:17:33.822
Went missing?

366
00:17:33.822 --> 00:17:37.864
Martin Ackroyd failed to turn up for
work on the 7th of November 1983.

367
00:17:37.864 --> 00:17:41.989
No—one’s seen him since and his
case was classified as unsolved,

368
00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:44.072
so it comes under
the Ucos purvey already.

369
00:17:44.072 --> 00:17:46.364
Cop goes missing, they must
have looked pretty hard.

370
00:17:46.364 --> 00:17:48.697
They did, but he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

371
00:17:48.697 --> 00:17:50.072
Have we got a cause of death yet?

372
00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:52.656
Pathologist hasn’t finished yet
but the skull was caved in,

373
00:17:52.656 --> 00:17:54.447
so that’s our most likely
cause of death.

374
00:17:54.447 --> 00:17:56.781
We have no idea what the murder
weapon might have been,

375
00:17:56.781 --> 00:18:00.281
so I’ve asked Fiona Kennedy to
work on a reconstruction for us.

376
00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:02.947
So, who would have
wanted Ackroyd dead back then?

377
00:18:02.947 --> 00:18:05.322
What, you mean apart from all
the people he got banged up?

378
00:18:05.322 --> 00:18:08.156
The two people that were questioned
most thoroughly in connection

379
00:18:08.156 --> 00:18:11.572
with his disappearance were
two of his sergeants,
Don Bryant and Warren McCabe.

380
00:18:11.572 --> 00:18:13.947
There was a theory that Bryant
and McCabe were on the take

381
00:18:13.947 --> 00:18:16.197
and that Ackroyd found out
and was going to shop them.

382
00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:18.156
Nothing could be proved
but Bryant and McCabe

383
00:18:18.156 --> 00:18:20.656
were essentially
elbowed off the force anyway.

384
00:18:20.656 --> 00:18:22.656
Do you remember them, Gerry?

385
00:18:22.656 --> 00:18:24.447
Yeah, yeah, vaguely, I mean,

386
00:18:24.447 --> 00:18:27.281
I was only working with them
for a couple of months.

387
00:18:27.281 --> 00:18:31.739
I’m assuming that you can’t shed any
light on what happened to Ackroyd.

388
00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:33.197
Nah. I hardly knew him.

389
00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:35.947
He never came out drinking
or socialising or anything but...

390
00:18:37.197 --> 00:18:40.572
Well, I could have a word with
the other two, if you like. Yeah.

391
00:18:40.572 --> 00:18:43.364
Therre mnning a security firm now.
Take Danny.

392
00:18:44.614 --> 00:18:47.572
It’d be just as easy
if I went on my own, wouldn’t it?

393
00:18:47.572 --> 00:18:50.364
Yeah, but given that you worked with
Ackroyd, albeit briefly,

394
00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:53.364
I’d rather someone unconnected
went with you. 0K.

395
00:18:53.364 --> 00:18:56.364
Look, I know this goes without saying
but I’m going to say it anyway,

396
00:18:56.364 --> 00:18:58.447
this is the murder of a fellow
police officer.

397
00:18:58.447 --> 00:19:00.114
We take that very seriously indeed,

398
00:19:00.114 --> 00:19:01.947
so let’s not
put a foot wrong here, 0K?

399
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:20.197
So these two were on the take? I
don’t know, do I look like Serpico?

400
00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:22.822
No, you really don’t.
Well, things were different then.

401
00:19:22.822 --> 00:19:24.447
You chase villains all day long

402
00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:27.489
and then you’d end up drinking in
the same boozer as them after work.

403
00:19:27.489 --> 00:19:29.614
I’m not sure that was
everyone’s experience.

404
00:19:29.614 --> 00:19:32.239
I’m just saying that the lines
were blurred back then.

405
00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:34.322
It was harder to tell who was
properly dodgy

406
00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:36.406
and who just had a few tasty mates.

407
00:19:37.614 --> 00:19:41.906
If these two were bent, still
doesn’t mean they killed a cop.

408
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:44.614
That’s a very big deal.

409
00:19:48.447 --> 00:19:51.697
Good morning. Hello. We’re
here to see Mr Bryant and Mr McCabe.

410
00:19:53.947 --> 00:19:56.406
Don’t talk to them.
They’re in thejob.

411
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:02.031
Is that...? Gerry Standing,
as I live and breathe.

412
00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:06.114
I didn’t know if you’d remember me.
Danny Griffin, Warren McCabe.

413
00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:09.406
Never forget a face. You’re in that
Ucos now, ain’t you? Yeah, yeah.

414
00:20:09.406 --> 00:20:12.906
You too, Danny? Looks like you’ve
got all your own teeth.

415
00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:15.656
You must be work experience
or something.

416
00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:16.906
Is Mr Bryant here too?

417
00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:21.364
He’s in a meeting.
Meeting’s over, Warren.

418
00:20:30.406 --> 00:20:34.781
Gerald. Come in. Mr...?
Griffin, Danny Griffin.

419
00:20:44.156 --> 00:20:48.031
Martin Ackroyd is dead.
That’s very sad.

420
00:20:49.906 --> 00:20:53.614
Mind you, how old must he have been?

421
00:20:53.614 --> 00:20:56.906
70, 75? Note bad innings.

422
00:20:56.906 --> 00:21:00.531
They found his body this morning,
he’s been dead for over 30 years.

423
00:21:00.531 --> 00:21:02.864
So when everyone thought he’d
disappeared...?

424
00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:07.322
Presumably someone killed him
and that’s why you’re here.

425
00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:13.739
We’re first on the list, Warren.

426
00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:17.614
We did both give quite
detailed statements at the time.

427
00:21:17.614 --> 00:21:20.322
Yeah, but we’ve got to follow it up.
You know how it is, Don.

428
00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:23.656
Of course I do. But...

429
00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:29.447
I don’t think we’ve got anything to
add to our original statements.

430
00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:31.447
Warren?

431
00:21:31.447 --> 00:21:33.614
What he said.

432
00:21:33.614 --> 00:21:37.489
If anything, the passing of three
decades has rendered events...

433
00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.656
..a little bit fuzzier.

434
00:21:40.656 --> 00:21:42.614
There was a rumour
at the time that Ackroyd had

435
00:21:42.614 --> 00:21:45.031
information about police corruption.

436
00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:46.739
Rumours in a police station.

437
00:21:47.989 --> 00:21:52.906
Only rumours, though, Mr Griffin,
nothing proved. We’re aware of that.

438
00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:56.406
Just so we make sure we’re not
throwing old, false accusations

439
00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:59.989
around trying to
make two plus two equal five.

440
00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:02.114
We wouldn’t do that, Don.

441
00:22:02.114 --> 00:22:07.906
Well, I’m sure if either of us
remember anything... Of course.

442
00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:11.281
Right, well,
lovely to have met you both.

443
00:22:11.281 --> 00:22:13.697
Certainly done all right
for yourselves despite leaving

444
00:22:13.697 --> 00:22:14.864
the force early.

445
00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:17.031
Still, I suppose you’re always going
to be busy with

446
00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:18.822
the Chapman family as a client.

447
00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:23.489
That was Dominic Chapman
leaving as we came in, wasn’t it?

448
00:22:23.489 --> 00:22:24.906
I didn’t know he was out.

449
00:22:31.197 --> 00:22:35.114
If you could look menacingly after us
as we leave, that would be super.

450
00:22:40.364 --> 00:22:43.697
So, Bryant and McCabe are being
bankrolled by the Chapmans.

451
00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:47.031
That’s what it looks like.
The Chapmans are... Organised crime.

452
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:50.156
Gerry, was there a connection
back then between Bryant, McCabe

453
00:22:50.156 --> 00:22:51.489
and the Chapmans?

454
00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:55.031
Not that I can remember, no.
I want someone on Bryant and McCabe.

455
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:57.364
Now that they know Ackroyd’s
body’s surfaced,

456
00:22:57.364 --> 00:23:00.197
I want to know what they do
and where they go. Gerry?

457
00:23:00.197 --> 00:23:02.572
Me? No, no, no,
I can’t do it, I’m sorry.

458
00:23:02.572 --> 00:23:05.072
Well, I’m looking after the
little’un tomorrow, aren’t I?

459
00:23:05.072 --> 00:23:08.156
Caitlin said I’ve got to have an
early night. Danny? I’d love to...

460
00:23:08.156 --> 00:23:09.739
Good. ..but I have plans.

461
00:23:09.739 --> 00:23:13.489
There’s a special screening of The
Big Sleep. I promised Fiona. Danny!

462
00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:17.364
Sorry, she’s scarier than you.
She is not. Yeah, she is.

463
00:23:22.656 --> 00:23:25.864
This is so not how I imagined
running my own unit would be,

464
00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:28.364
there was
going to be coffee and doughnuts.

465
00:23:28.364 --> 00:23:30.239
People calling you chief. Yes.

466
00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:33.781
I’ll do it, chief. Thank you, Steve.
Time and a half, wasn’t it?

467
00:23:33.781 --> 00:23:35.156
What happened to civic duty?

468
00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:37.906
It’s alive and well
and costs 50% more after 6pm.

469
00:23:47.197 --> 00:23:52.406
She was amazing, wasn’t she?
I love that phone call they do.

470
00:23:52.406 --> 00:23:55.406
And the chemistry between them.

471
00:23:55.406 --> 00:23:57.697
I said the chemistry between them.

472
00:23:57.697 --> 00:23:59.031
Sorry.

473
00:24:00.156 --> 00:24:02.156
You 0K?

474
00:24:03.447 --> 00:24:07.531
Did you not enjoy it? Yeah, yeah,
loved it, it’s a brilliant film.

475
00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:11.697
I’m just preoccupied.
Do you want to talk about it?

476
00:24:11.697 --> 00:24:13.281
It’s just work.

477
00:24:14.697 --> 00:24:17.864
You spend roughly 50 hours
a weekjust working.

478
00:24:17.864 --> 00:24:21.531
You want to keep half your working
life secret from me.

479
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:22.947
I don’t want to bore you.

480
00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:27.947
Golf is boring, cricket is boring,
the first Star Trek movie,

481
00:24:27.947 --> 00:24:31.281
the original, not the new one,
Visconti’s The Leopard,
that’s really boring.

482
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:33.739
Just a moment, cricket is not boring.

483
00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:37.114
Your work is not boring.

484
00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:39.781
Not to me.

485
00:24:39.781 --> 00:24:40.781
Cos you’re in it.

486
00:24:43.947 --> 00:24:47.281
This body in the basement, are you
up—to—date on everything?

487
00:24:47.281 --> 00:24:50.406
Yes, he was a cop, Martin Ackroyd.

488
00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:53.114
He was Gerry’s old boss.

489
00:24:53.114 --> 00:24:54.406
Not for long but...

490
00:24:56.822 --> 00:25:01.031
And? And...| don’t know.

491
00:25:01.031 --> 00:25:03.489
Gerry’s being a bit weird.

492
00:25:03.489 --> 00:25:05.031
It’s probably nothing.

493
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:08.156
I’m flattered to have lost your
attention to "probably nothing"

494
00:25:08.156 --> 00:25:10.281
for the entire evening.

495
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:16.072
Well, we found a signet ring with
the body and Gerry’s reaction

496
00:25:16.072 --> 00:25:18.239
when he saw it was...

497
00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:22.197
He seemed to recognise it
but he didn’t let on.

498
00:25:22.197 --> 00:25:23.656
Well, maybe Gerry recognised it

499
00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:26.406
and finally realised what had
happened to Ackroyd.

500
00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:29.739
So why not say something?
I don’t know.

501
00:25:29.739 --> 00:25:33.322
Maybe he wasn’t sure, maybe
he had other things on his mind.

502
00:25:33.322 --> 00:25:35.614
Yes, he did go straight home
after work.

503
00:25:35.614 --> 00:25:39.697
Sorry, Gerry went home after work?
0h, now I’m worried.

504
00:25:41.822 --> 00:25:45.239
I must say, I’m rather enjoying
the keen—eyed detective noting

505
00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:46.864
everything out of the ordinary.

506
00:25:46.864 --> 00:25:49.822
Like the modern
incarnation of Philip Marlowe.

507
00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:53.572
Down these mean streets a man must
walk. What, Mayfair?

508
00:25:53.572 --> 00:25:59.239
You’d be surprised. Go on. Tales of
lust and murder amongst high society.

509
00:25:59.239 --> 00:26:01.781
Lean towards the lust,
murder’s a bit worky.

510
00:26:03.614 --> 00:26:05.739
I can do lust. I know you can.

511
00:26:07.572 --> 00:26:10.322
(“an a dame like you handla it,
though?

512
00:26:10.322 --> 00:26:14.239
You’lljust have to try me,
Mr Marlowe. Call me Phil.

513
00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:18.947
He wouldn’t have said that.
No, 0K, how about

514
00:26:18.947 --> 00:26:21.697
"She was the kind of forensic
anthropologist who could make

515
00:26:21.697 --> 00:26:23.947
"a bishop kick a hole
in a stained—glass window"?

516
00:26:23.947 --> 00:26:26.406
That’s more like it.
I’ll get my coat.

517
00:26:27.781 --> 00:26:33.447
Hiya. I’m looking for Tommy Naylor.
Tommy Naylor.

518
00:26:33.447 --> 00:26:35.197
No, sorry, mate. All right.

519
00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:48.072
PHONE RINGS

520
00:26:50.781 --> 00:26:55.447
Hello? Doug! Hello, mate,
thanks for getting back to us.

521
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.572
Yeah, yeah, I’m not bad, yeah.

522
00:26:57.572 --> 00:27:00.447
You? What you up to?

523
00:27:00.447 --> 00:27:03.864
Doug? Hello, you’re breaking up,
mate.

524
00:27:03.864 --> 00:27:07.406
Hold on, Doug? Doug? You...

525
00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:09.906
There you are.

526
00:27:09.906 --> 00:27:13.781
No, no, I’m trying to
track down Tommy Naylor.

527
00:27:13.781 --> 00:27:17.114
I’m slowly working my way through
all the old haunts but no sign yet.

528
00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:21.281
No, no. You haven’t got a number
for him, have you?

529
00:27:21.281 --> 00:27:23.822
0h, is he? When’s he back?

530
00:27:26.364 --> 00:27:31.031
Cheers, mate, thanks a lot.
Hello, Gerald.

531
00:27:31.031 --> 00:27:35.322
I was wondering when you two
would pitch up. And here we are.

532
00:27:35.322 --> 00:27:38.822
Looking for Tommy Naylor, are we?
Your old partner in crime.

533
00:27:41.364 --> 00:27:44.781
What happened to Ackroyd?
He died, apparently.

534
00:27:44.781 --> 00:27:45.989
You told us that, didn’t you?

535
00:27:45.989 --> 00:27:48.406
That’s right, and we’re going to
get to the bottom of it.

536
00:27:48.406 --> 00:27:52.364
I don’t think you want to do that,
Gerald. See...

537
00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:54.822
what with all those
shenanigans back then,

538
00:27:54.822 --> 00:27:58.822
it was sort of best that should
dear old Martin Ackroyd resurface,

539
00:27:58.822 --> 00:28:02.739
which it seems he’s done
now, it might be best to

540
00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:06.406
provide a helpful trail
of breadcrumbs for whichever coppers

541
00:28:06.406 --> 00:28:10.239
might find themselves in need of
some investigative assistance.

542
00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:13.781
What have you done?
You don’t want to know. Stay clear.

543
00:28:13.781 --> 00:28:15.572
It’s for your own good, Gerald.

544
00:28:16.697 --> 00:28:20.031
Think of this as a friendly
warning of what’s at stake here.

545
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:24.364
In case you’ve forgotten
since the Naylor business. Oh, yeah?

546
00:28:24.364 --> 00:28:25.906
Hiya, Gerry.

547
00:28:25.906 --> 00:28:28.656
I was looking for you in the pub but
they said I’d just missed you.

548
00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:31.447
I’ve got the car with me if you
fancy a ride home. You head off.

549
00:28:31.447 --> 00:28:34.447
I’ll see you in the morning.
You’d best be on your way.

550
00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:39.114
0h, you’d best
be trying to make me, pal.

551
00:28:39.114 --> 00:28:41.031
I was a cop in Glasgow.

552
00:28:41.031 --> 00:28:45.822
Do you think this is my first time
round the dance ﬂoor? Well?

553
00:28:45.822 --> 00:28:47.697
Are you dancing?

554
00:28:49.447 --> 00:28:53.781
Well, it was lovely running into you
again, Gerald, let’s keep in touch.

555
00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:54.947
We will.

556
00:29:01.614 --> 00:29:04.197
So following these two from club
to pub to bar, wondering what

557
00:29:04.197 --> 00:29:06.031
the hell they’re up to and,
lo and behold,

558
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:07.572
it turns out they’re following you.

559
00:29:07.572 --> 00:29:10.072
What’s all that about?
I’ve known them from way back.

560
00:29:10.072 --> 00:29:13.197
It didn’t exactly
look like Friends Reunited.

561
00:29:13.197 --> 00:29:15.614
A little misunderstanding,
that’s all.

562
00:29:15.614 --> 00:29:19.197
What’s going on, Gerry?
Nothing. That wasn’t nothing.

563
00:29:19.197 --> 00:29:22.572
Look, Steve, it’s not relevant to
anything, leave it.

564
00:29:22.572 --> 00:29:25.906
OK, so you’re happy enough for me
to include that little fracas

565
00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:29.031
when I report back to
Sasha in the morning?

566
00:29:30.364 --> 00:29:33.531
Well, no, I’d ratheryou didn’t.
Well, there’s a shock. Who’s Naylor?

567
00:29:34.864 --> 00:29:37.281
who? Gerry.

568
00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:40.072
Look, it’s just a bit of ancient
history that needs clearing up,

569
00:29:40.072 --> 00:29:41.281
I’m fine.

570
00:29:43.447 --> 00:29:44.697
All right.

571
00:29:45.864 --> 00:29:50.364
If you say so. Yeah. Oh, and thanks
for the lift home. No problem.

572
00:29:50.364 --> 00:29:53.031
Have a good day with the baby
tomorrow. Oh, yeah, yeah, cheers.

573
00:29:57.822 --> 00:30:00.447
Who’s Naylor? Good night, Steve.

574
00:30:10.281 --> 00:30:11.489
DOOR SLAMS

575
00:30:11.489 --> 00:30:13.239
This way, Gerry.

576
00:30:14.447 --> 00:30:16.114
Let me introduce you to the team.

577
00:30:18.197 --> 00:30:21.531
Gerry Standing,
meet Warren McCabe and Don Bryant.

578
00:30:21.531 --> 00:30:24.489
All right? Gerry’s one of us now,
aren’t you, Gerry?

579
00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:25.947
You two can show him the ropes.

580
00:31:00.114 --> 00:31:01.864
Welcome to the team, Gerald.

581
00:31:03.864 --> 00:31:06.197
You’re saying Don Bryant
gave this to you?

582
00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:08.281
And he got it from who?

583
00:31:08.281 --> 00:31:10.322
I don’t know the bloke’s name.

584
00:31:10.322 --> 00:31:13.531
Scrap metal yard, off the Uxbridge
Road, belongs to the Chapman family.

585
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:16.822
I’m not a grass.

586
00:31:16.822 --> 00:31:19.572
But I’m not on the take, either,
and I don’t want to be.

587
00:31:19.572 --> 00:31:20.906
I just want to do me job.

588
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:23.447
I understand.

589
00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:27.697
And I’m sorry about this.

590
00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:32.906
I was worried that something was
going on with those two, but...

591
00:31:32.906 --> 00:31:36.156
they get results and I wanted to
believe that was on the up and up.

592
00:31:38.697 --> 00:31:40.489
But all right...

593
00:31:40.489 --> 00:31:42.239
Do you know how we deal with this?

594
00:31:43.906 --> 00:31:45.281
How?

595
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:47.322
This needs to go upstairs.

596
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:50.489
DCI Sainsbury’s running a team
looking at the Chapman family.

597
00:31:50.489 --> 00:31:52.239
If Bryant and McCabe
are in their pocket,

598
00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:53.947
Sainsbury will
want to know about it.

599
00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:58.447
I think he’s going to want more
evidence thanjust this.

600
00:32:00.031 --> 00:32:02.031
You need to carry on as you were.

601
00:32:03.197 --> 00:32:06.072
Take the money they give you,
make a note of how much

602
00:32:06.072 --> 00:32:07.406
and where it came from.

603
00:32:08.906 --> 00:32:12.031
This is just you
and me at the moment. All right?

604
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:14.072
I just want to do me job.

605
00:32:14.072 --> 00:32:16.156
This is yourjob now, Gerry.

606
00:32:16.156 --> 00:32:18.156
You’re gathering evidence.

607
00:32:21.947 --> 00:32:23.822
Baby formula...

608
00:32:23.822 --> 00:32:26.906
It’s already mixed in the bottles.
You just nuke it for 30 seconds,

609
00:32:26.906 --> 00:32:29.572
then give it a good shake,
make sure it’s not too hot.

610
00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:31.531
We know all this, don’t we?

611
00:32:31.531 --> 00:32:34.364
But don’t be dipping yourfingers in
it if you’ve just had a fag, Dad.

612
00:32:34.364 --> 00:32:35.614
I wouldn’t do that!

613
00:32:35.614 --> 00:32:38.739
And he’ll need winding after.
Yeah, like I used to wind you.

614
00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:40.489
Er, like Mum used to wind me.

615
00:32:41.822 --> 00:32:43.489
You’re going to be late, you know.

616
00:32:43.489 --> 00:32:44.822
SHE SIGHS

617
00:32:44.822 --> 00:32:46.531
0K.

618
00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:49.739
You’ll be all right?
Yeah, of course we will.

619
00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:52.031
A bit of telly,
a couple of songs, eh?

620
00:32:52.031 --> 00:32:54.114
Oh, for God’s sake don’t
sing to him.

621
00:32:54.114 --> 00:32:55.572
CHUCKLES
Very funny!

622
00:32:55.572 --> 00:32:57.239
Thanks for this, Dad.

623
00:32:57.239 --> 00:32:59.364
I’ll check in when I can.
0K, we’ll be here.

624
00:32:59.364 --> 00:33:01.322
Bye, sweetheart. Bye, Mummy.

625
00:33:01.322 --> 00:33:02.781
Bye—bye. Go on, wave.

626
00:33:06.156 --> 00:33:09.031
DOOR CLOSES
All right, Charlas.

627
00:33:09.031 --> 00:33:11.031
Get your coat, we’re going out.

628
00:33:17.531 --> 00:33:19.156
HE SIGHS

629
00:33:20.697 --> 00:33:23.197
Does the name Naylor mean
anything to you?

630
00:33:23.197 --> 00:33:25.031
As in Tommy Naylor?

631
00:33:25.031 --> 00:33:26.031
Yeah, it might be.

632
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:28.406
It’s just a name that came
up in one of Ackroyd’s files.

633
00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:30.072
It’s before my time down here,
you know.

634
00:33:30.072 --> 00:33:31.906
It’s probably Tommy Naylor, then.

635
00:33:31.906 --> 00:33:34.822
Organised crime,
rival to the Chapman family.

636
00:33:34.822 --> 00:33:37.197
He wouldn’t have been making very
big waves back then

637
00:33:37.197 --> 00:33:39.697
but he would have probably
been on the radar.

638
00:33:39.697 --> 00:33:41.864
Is he still around? Oh, yes.

639
00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:45.322
You’re in early.

640
00:33:45.322 --> 00:33:46.989
Worms to catch.

641
00:33:46.989 --> 00:33:48.156
So how was last night?

642
00:33:50.322 --> 00:33:53.031
Steve? Hm, with what?

643
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.364
Bryant and McCabe?

644
00:33:54.364 --> 00:33:57.447
Oh, yeah, yeah. They went on a bit
of a pub crawl but, er...

645
00:33:57.447 --> 00:33:59.781
Nothing to report.

646
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:02.281
WHISPERS: Morning. Gerry?

647
00:34:02.281 --> 00:34:04.406
Shhh! He’s asleep!

648
00:34:04.406 --> 00:34:06.031
Gerry, you’re not meant to be here.

649
00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:10.197
Well, I got a bit bored and
I thought you could do with a hand.

650
00:34:10.197 --> 00:34:13.531
This is Charlie. Gerry,
you can’t bring a baby into work...

651
00:34:15.072 --> 00:34:17.489
..however cute he might be.

652
00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.864
Oh, look at his little hands.

653
00:34:19.864 --> 00:34:21.156
BABY TALK: Hello, Charlie.

654
00:34:21.156 --> 00:34:23.031
A right little bruiser, isn’t he?

655
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:25.031
Well, he’s certainly
got the genes for it.

656
00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:27.864
Just make sure he never goes near
one of those book things.

657
00:34:29.822 --> 00:34:31.781
Oh, gosh.

658
00:34:31.781 --> 00:34:35.656
He’s actually incredibly sweet,
Gerry. Congratulations.

659
00:34:35.656 --> 00:34:37.239
No, he’s brilliant, as good as gold.

660
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.156
Yeah, but he can’t be in the office.

661
00:34:39.156 --> 00:34:41.614
Well, I’ve got something to
check on the computer.

662
00:34:41.614 --> 00:34:44.239
I’ll only be an hour or so,
and then we’ll be out of your hair.

663
00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.822
As if I don’t have enough
babies to look after!

664
00:34:57.906 --> 00:34:59.614
Jesus!

665
00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:00.989
Ah, there you are.

666
00:35:00.989 --> 00:35:04.031
I am trying to run a murder
investigation here. Sorry.

667
00:35:04.031 --> 00:35:07.031
I—I came in early and...
You’re not sleeping, are you, sir?

668
00:35:07.031 --> 00:35:09.822
The new baby doesn’t like sleep.
No, they don’t.

669
00:35:09.822 --> 00:35:11.781
She knows exactly
when I’m just nodding off,

670
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:14.072
she can time it to the second.
Uncanny, aren’t they?

671
00:35:14.072 --> 00:35:16.322
When do they,
erm...when do they stop this?

672
00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:17.739
Oh, it’s just a few more months

673
00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:20.989
and then, of course,
she’ll start teething...
No, she won’t. I won’t allow it.

674
00:35:24.531 --> 00:35:26.031
BABY CRIES

675
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:28.614
I ran hear it.
It’s like she’s inside my head.

676
00:35:32.322 --> 00:35:33.531
Gerry?

677
00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.322
BABY CONTINUES CRYING

678
00:35:35.322 --> 00:35:37.239
The baby’s awake. All right.

679
00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:38.864
Well, it might need winding.

680
00:35:38.864 --> 00:35:40.781
Orfeeding?

681
00:35:40.781 --> 00:35:43.781
Did you bring milk?
Of course I did, it’s down there.

682
00:35:43.781 --> 00:35:46.239
Well, I’ll do it, then, shall I?

683
00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:47.614
Yeah, that’d be nice.

684
00:35:52.822 --> 00:35:55.489
Give him here.
He probably doesn’t like heights.

685
00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:59.156
There you are, there’s a good boy.
Look, he smiled at me.

686
00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:02.614
Did he really? Would you get out
of his way? You’re freaking him out.

687
00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:07.072
You blokes are doing great.

688
00:36:07.072 --> 00:36:10.197
So I’m just going to nip
out for a bit. You’re what?

689
00:36:10.197 --> 00:36:13.031
I won’t be long.
There’s extra nappies down there.

690
00:36:13.031 --> 00:36:14.906
Gerry... Gerry, you can’t go.

691
00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.322
You’re doing brilliantly!

692
00:36:16.322 --> 00:36:18.864
But you can’tjust leave him here,
you can’t leave him here.

693
00:36:18.864 --> 00:36:21.822
We’re in a nick,
he couldn’t be in safer hands.

694
00:36:21.822 --> 00:36:23.739
I won’t be long. Gerry...

695
00:36:23.739 --> 00:36:25.864
Oh, and rememberto wind him.

696
00:36:31.072 --> 00:36:33.489
So Bryant and McCabe are top
of the list?

697
00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:36.281
For the moment, yes.

698
00:36:36.281 --> 00:36:39.572
We want to get the ins
and outs on their connection with
the Chapman family.

699
00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:41.364
PHONE BLEEPS

700
00:36:43.614 --> 00:36:44.989
0h!

701
00:36:44.989 --> 00:36:46.989
Ah, internet date?

702
00:36:46.989 --> 00:36:51.281
Is that Grinding,
or whatever it’s called?

703
00:36:51.281 --> 00:36:52.947
No.

704
00:36:52.947 --> 00:36:56.322
No, sir, it’s not that one.

705
00:36:56.322 --> 00:36:57.864
Going well though, is it?

706
00:36:57.864 --> 00:37:00.572
Yeah, going fine, thank you.

707
00:37:00.572 --> 00:37:02.656
Excellent!

708
00:37:06.697 --> 00:37:08.697
Sir?

709
00:37:08.697 --> 00:37:11.447
Good. Right. I’m...

710
00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.572
Good work. Keep it...

711
00:37:15.572 --> 00:37:17.572
Keep going.

712
00:37:17.572 --> 00:37:20.781
I think you’re right. Probably where
we should... That makes some sense.

713
00:37:20.781 --> 00:37:23.281
We should get over there right away.

714
00:37:23.281 --> 00:37:25.156
BABY CRIES

715
00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:28.697
Sir.

716
00:37:28.697 --> 00:37:30.822
It’s sleep deprivation.

717
00:37:32.031 --> 00:37:33.447
I actually am going mad.

718
00:37:37.322 --> 00:37:40.031
0K, Danny, you seem to have
this situation under control.

719
00:37:40.031 --> 00:37:43.781
What?! Steve? I’ll be on my mobile
if you need me. Steve! You...!

720
00:37:49.114 --> 00:37:51.489
Where is everyone? I don’t know.

721
00:37:51.489 --> 00:37:54.739
One day they’ll have to come back,
and I will be waiting.

722
00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:57.947
You’re holding him wrong.
I’m not holding him wrong. Here.

723
00:38:00.656 --> 00:38:03.156
0h... Hello.

724
00:38:03.156 --> 00:38:06.156
The child hates me. Oh!

725
00:38:06.156 --> 00:38:08.572
BABY TALK: Well, let’s hope you can
solve the murder,

726
00:38:08.572 --> 00:38:10.989
Charlie, because no—one
else around here seems bothered.

727
00:38:10.989 --> 00:38:13.864
Actually, I’ve found something.

728
00:38:13.864 --> 00:38:16.906
I was going through Ackroyd’s
old paperwork

729
00:38:16.906 --> 00:38:19.114
and there is something odd here.

730
00:38:19.114 --> 00:38:22.822
Oh, what has Uncle Danny found?

731
00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:26.656
Uncle Danny has found an unpaid
invoice from a company called

732
00:38:26.656 --> 00:38:31.572
R Woolcott Associates, presented
a week before Ackroyd disappeared.

733
00:38:31.572 --> 00:38:33.822
BABY TALK: And who were they, then?

734
00:38:33.822 --> 00:38:35.947
Well, they don’t exist any more.

735
00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:38.114
They don’t exist any more.

736
00:38:38.114 --> 00:38:41.406
But it looks like they were
private detectives.

737
00:38:41.406 --> 00:38:45.114
Why is the dead policeman hiring
private detectives, eh?

738
00:38:46.531 --> 00:38:49.739
One day I shalljust start screaming
and I may never stop.

739
00:38:56.031 --> 00:38:58.364
Ronald Sainsbury? Yeah?

740
00:38:58.364 --> 00:39:00.781
Morning. I’m from Ucos.

741
00:39:00.781 --> 00:39:03.864
0h, Jack Halford’s lot, right?

742
00:39:03.864 --> 00:39:07.031
Yeah, not any longer, sadly.
Well, how can I help you?

743
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:11.322
I was wondering if I could take you
on a little trip down memory lane.

744
00:39:11.322 --> 00:39:15.156
He was one of your lot, as well,
wasn’t he? Yeah, Brian, that’s right.

745
00:39:15.156 --> 00:39:18.822
Yeah, ordinarily
I would ask you inside

746
00:39:18.822 --> 00:39:21.906
butJune’s got one of her
church group meetings

747
00:39:21.906 --> 00:39:24.697
going on in the living room
and they’re all barking mad.

748
00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:26.697
No, I’m all right here.

749
00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:30.114
Do you remember a DCI
called Martin Ackroyd?

750
00:39:30.114 --> 00:39:33.031
Oh, yeah, yeah. He disappeared.

751
00:39:33.031 --> 00:39:35.739
No, his body turned up yesterday.

752
00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:38.989
He’s been under a basement in
Primrose Hill for the last 30 years.

753
00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:40.864
Blimey!

754
00:39:40.864 --> 00:39:43.697
I’m not sure I can shed
any light on that for you.

755
00:39:43.697 --> 00:39:45.531
No, of course not.

756
00:39:45.531 --> 00:39:49.031
I worked for Ackroyd very briefly
alongside a couple of sergeants,

757
00:39:49.031 --> 00:39:51.114
Don Bryant and Warren McCabe.

758
00:39:51.114 --> 00:39:54.531
Oh, those two toerags! Yeah.

759
00:39:54.531 --> 00:39:58.281
You led a team investigating
the Chapmans, right?

760
00:39:58.281 --> 00:40:02.031
Did you have a list of all the cops
who were on Chapman’s payroll?

761
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:04.697
I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name.

762
00:40:04.697 --> 00:40:06.697
I’m sorry, Gerry Standing.

763
00:40:06.697 --> 00:40:08.447
0h, right.

764
00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:10.406
I see where this is going now.

765
00:40:10.406 --> 00:40:11.614
Meaning what?

766
00:40:11.614 --> 00:40:14.781
You’re worried your name
is on the list, are you?

767
00:40:14.781 --> 00:40:17.156
Excuse me?
Gerry Standing, yes.

768
00:40:18.447 --> 00:40:22.239
Your name cropped up in that
investigation, as much as anyone’s.

769
00:40:22.239 --> 00:40:24.947
No, no, no, I’m clean. Really?

770
00:40:24.947 --> 00:40:28.364
I think you were up to your neck
in it then.

771
00:40:28.364 --> 00:40:32.031
I think you’re up to your eyes in it
now they’ve found Ackroyd’s body.

772
00:40:32.031 --> 00:40:36.531
You see, the way I heard it,
he had been quietly gathering

773
00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:40.614
evidence for months and he was
just about to blow the whistle

774
00:40:40.614 --> 00:40:44.572
and suddenly he vanishes
off the face of the earth.

775
00:40:44.572 --> 00:40:47.656
You must have had quite
a party down the pub that night.

776
00:40:47.656 --> 00:40:50.072
No, no, no, Iwas never bent.

777
00:40:50.072 --> 00:40:53.656
And now I work for Ucos
and we need that list.

778
00:40:53.656 --> 00:40:56.322
There is no list, it went missing.

779
00:40:56.322 --> 00:40:58.364
Along with all the case files.

780
00:40:58.364 --> 00:41:00.281
What, everything gone? Yes.

781
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:02.822
Ackroyd vanished, so did our case.

782
00:41:02.822 --> 00:41:05.531
Shame, really, because
it would have been nice

783
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:08.906
if your lot had got what
was coming to you.

784
00:41:08.906 --> 00:41:11.614
Whatever! Thanks for your time.

785
00:41:11.614 --> 00:41:13.281
Yeah.
HORN BEEPS

786
00:41:16.906 --> 00:41:19.322
DOOR SLAMS

787
00:41:19.322 --> 00:41:20.614
He’s gone.

788
00:41:20.614 --> 00:41:24.031
What did you tell him?
Put the wind up him, like you said.

789
00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:26.322
He’s shitting himself.

790
00:41:26.322 --> 00:41:27.656
It will only get worse.

791
00:41:28.781 --> 00:41:30.156
Are you ready for the next part?

792
00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:34.364
Let’s make it look good,
shall we?

793
00:41:51.906 --> 00:41:55.739
Tommy Naylor? Oh, I smell bacon.

794
00:41:55.739 --> 00:41:59.031
Anyone smell bacon? That’s very good.

795
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:00.614
I’ve never heard that.

796
00:42:00.614 --> 00:42:02.156
NAYLOR CHUCKLES

797
00:42:04.031 --> 00:42:06.156
I haven’t committed
a crime in Scotland, have I?

798
00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:08.489
It depends how far back
you can trace your family.

799
00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:11.614
I think we have a tartan, but
everyone has a tartan, don’t they?

800
00:42:11.614 --> 00:42:13.364
Please.

801
00:42:17.364 --> 00:42:19.572
I didn’t catch your name.
Steve McAndrew.

802
00:42:19.572 --> 00:42:21.864
I’m with the Unsolved Crimes And
Open Case Squad.

803
00:42:21.864 --> 00:42:24.031
Retired? Yeah. Lucky you.

804
00:42:24.031 --> 00:42:26.447
Does the name Martin Ackroyd mean
anything to you?

805
00:42:27.864 --> 00:42:29.072
No, I don’t think so.

806
00:42:29.072 --> 00:42:31.864
He was a detective chief inspector
in the early ‘805.

807
00:42:31.864 --> 00:42:33.864
0h, a cop!

808
00:42:33.864 --> 00:42:36.114
Ackroyd, yes.

809
00:42:36.114 --> 00:42:39.489
Yes, I remember him.
Is he a friend of yours?

810
00:42:39.489 --> 00:42:41.656
No. He’s dead.

811
00:42:42.947 --> 00:42:45.906
Sorry to hear that. Really?

812
00:42:48.031 --> 00:42:49.656
Just something you say, isn’t it?

813
00:42:49.656 --> 00:42:51.656
I never really knew Mr Ackroyd.

814
00:42:51.656 --> 00:42:56.031
We were on opposite sides back when
I used to be a little bit naughty,
so we never had much contact.

815
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:58.947
What about a guy who used to work
with him, Gerry Standing?

816
00:43:00.781 --> 00:43:02.614
No, sorry.

817
00:43:02.614 --> 00:43:04.197
Doesn’t ring any bells.

818
00:43:07.864 --> 00:43:11.572
Gerry’s a friend of mine
and I think he’s in some trouble.

819
00:43:11.572 --> 00:43:15.322
It involves a couple of ex—cops who
run a security firm now.

820
00:43:15.322 --> 00:43:17.031
0h!

821
00:43:18.197 --> 00:43:19.906
So we both know
who I’m talking about.

822
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:25.406
The past is a foreign country,
Steven.

823
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:29.156
It’s not a tourist destination.

824
00:43:30.822 --> 00:43:32.947
I should leave well alone
if I were you.

825
00:43:46.572 --> 00:43:48.906
I’m back! Shhh!

826
00:43:48.906 --> 00:43:50.781
We’ve just this second got him down.

827
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:52.947
I told you, he’s as good as gold.

828
00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:58.072
Where the bloody hell have you been?
0h, following something up.

829
00:43:58.072 --> 00:44:01.822
Dead end, though. I better get this
little bloke home, hadn’t I?

830
00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:04.614
So this is just free
childcare for you?

831
00:44:04.614 --> 00:44:06.447
I’ll make it up to you.

832
00:44:06.447 --> 00:44:09.197
Tonight, the drinks are on me.
Too right they are!

833
00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:12.531
Where’s Steve?

834
00:44:12.531 --> 00:44:14.072
God knows. He’s disappeared.

835
00:44:14.072 --> 00:44:17.322
You’d never know we were
in the middle of a murder inquiry.

836
00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:46.947
Hello, is Tommy Naylor there,
please?

837
00:44:48.406 --> 00:44:50.114
Ah...

838
00:44:50.114 --> 00:44:52.614
Yeah, just tell him
it’s an old friend.

839
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:04.364
I’m out.

840
00:45:09.531 --> 00:45:11.239
I’ll see you.

841
00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:14.739
And I’ll raise you 50.

842
00:45:14.739 --> 00:45:16.489
50?

843
00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:18.781
Gerry...

844
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:20.322
You’re at the big boys’ table now.

845
00:45:22.031 --> 00:45:24.281
Come on, then, see me.

846
00:45:24.281 --> 00:45:26.531
Show me what you got, Tommy.

847
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:29.406
Fine.

848
00:45:29.406 --> 00:45:31.281
I’ll see you.

849
00:45:33.322 --> 00:45:36.781
And I’ll raise you another...

850
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:37.906
50.

851
00:45:47.114 --> 00:45:48.322
I’m all in.

852
00:45:50.947 --> 00:45:52.114
Sure?

853
00:45:56.239 --> 00:45:58.281
This is going to hurt.

854
00:45:58.281 --> 00:45:59.531
Call.

855
00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:02.531
Flush.

856
00:46:02.531 --> 00:46:04.031
Ace high.

857
00:46:10.072 --> 00:46:11.322
Take it.

858
00:46:25.322 --> 00:46:27.322
Are you all right? I’m fine.

859
00:46:28.906 --> 00:46:30.906
Here, what did you have?

860
00:46:30.906 --> 00:46:33.197
I was bluffing. No, you weren’t.

861
00:46:33.197 --> 00:46:35.447
You had the full house.

862
00:46:35.447 --> 00:46:37.197
You couldn’t take the hit.

863
00:46:37.197 --> 00:46:39.739
I made the bet!
Yeah, for the benefit of the table.

864
00:46:41.197 --> 00:46:43.114
I could see it in your eyes, Gerry.

865
00:46:43.114 --> 00:46:45.947
That one was going to hurt.

866
00:46:45.947 --> 00:46:48.156
It’s supposed to be a level
playing field, Tommy.

867
00:46:48.156 --> 00:46:51.239
We leave the dayjobs behind.
I can’t be owing you favours.

868
00:46:51.239 --> 00:46:53.739
Relax, Gerry.
You don’t owe me anything.

869
00:46:53.739 --> 00:46:55.197
I’m not the Chapmans.

870
00:46:55.197 --> 00:46:58.531
What’s that supposed to mean?
It means I hear things.

871
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:00.656
We all hear things.

872
00:47:00.656 --> 00:47:02.572
Gerry Standing’s on the take.

873
00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:07.906
Except if you were on the take,

874
00:47:07.906 --> 00:47:10.531
you wouldn’t have looked so scared
of losing that last hand.

875
00:47:12.281 --> 00:47:15.822
You’re taking their money, Gerry,
but you’re not spending it.

876
00:47:15.822 --> 00:47:19.531
That suggests you might be playing
a very dangerous game indeed.

877
00:47:24.531 --> 00:47:26.614
You need someone to watch your back.

878
00:47:28.322 --> 00:47:29.614
Not as a quid pro quo...

879
00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:32.531
..just as a mate.

880
00:47:33.864 --> 00:47:35.072
I’m fine.

881
00:47:36.364 --> 00:47:38.406
You give my love to the missus
and little Caitlin.

882
00:47:40.531 --> 00:47:42.364
Keep them safe.

883
00:47:42.364 --> 00:47:44.656
The Chapmans don’t observe
the boundaries.

884
00:47:59.822 --> 00:48:01.031
DOORBELL RINGS

885
00:48:05.947 --> 00:48:08.531
Hello, Gerry. Long time no see.

886
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:09.781
Yeah.

887
00:48:09.781 --> 00:48:12.114
We’ve got trouble. So I hear.

888
00:48:12.114 --> 00:48:15.697
One of your friends came to see me.
Friend? who? Steve someone.

889
00:48:15.697 --> 00:48:17.739
Scottish, little, 3 bit chippy.

890
00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:19.906
Could we not do this on the doorstep?

891
00:48:19.906 --> 00:48:21.156
BABY CRIES

892
00:48:21.156 --> 00:48:23.447
New member of the clan?
Congratulations.

893
00:48:23.447 --> 00:48:26.156
I’ll put the kettle on, shall I?

894
00:48:26.156 --> 00:48:27.739
There you go, mate.

895
00:48:29.114 --> 00:48:31.197
Let’s get you cleaned up, eh?

896
00:48:31.197 --> 00:48:34.239
So, Ackroyd. ..

897
00:48:34.239 --> 00:48:37.489
What happened? Search me.

898
00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:39.364
I’d assumed he’d been
sitting on a beach

899
00:48:39.364 --> 00:48:41.031
somewhere for the last 30 years.

900
00:48:41.031 --> 00:48:43.864
Well, apparently, someone got to him
before he could get away.

901
00:48:43.864 --> 00:48:46.031
My money’s on Bryant and McCabe

902
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:48.531
on Dominic Chapman’s orders.

903
00:48:48.531 --> 00:48:50.364
The problem is...

904
00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:53.781
they put me in the frame for it.
That’s not good.

905
00:48:53.781 --> 00:48:57.447
I’ve no idea what evidence they’ve
planted, or where.

906
00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:02.072
Oh! What is that?

907
00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:04.614
That, Gerry, is a metaphor.

908
00:49:04.614 --> 00:49:06.531
Eurgh!

909
00:49:08.406 --> 00:49:09.739
So what can you do?

910
00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:13.531
They’re trying to make it look
like I was the bad cop
who killed a good cop.

911
00:49:15.239 --> 00:49:18.322
I’ve got to prove that
that’s not the way it happened.

912
00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.031
We.

913
00:49:20.031 --> 00:49:22.031
You’re not in this on your own.

914
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:23.406
Well, thanks, Tommy.

915
00:49:24.781 --> 00:49:28.406
I went to see one of the old DCIs
who were investigating

916
00:49:28.406 --> 00:49:32.572
the Chapmans at the time. I asked
if he had a list of dodgy cops.

917
00:49:32.572 --> 00:49:34.239
And?

918
00:49:34.239 --> 00:49:37.156
He said if he had,
I’d be on it.

919
00:49:37.156 --> 00:49:40.156
Mmm. Who was the cop?

920
00:49:40.156 --> 00:49:43.447
Er, Ronald Sainsbury,
he worked upstairs.

921
00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:45.739
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

922
00:49:45.739 --> 00:49:49.031
What? Two things, you’ve put
that nappy on back to front

923
00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:51.781
and Sainsbury was on the payroll.

924
00:49:51.781 --> 00:49:53.197
You’re kidding?

925
00:49:53.197 --> 00:49:55.447
No, he was one of Chapman’s.

926
00:49:55.447 --> 00:49:58.989
But even if you had got the list, it
wouldn’t have got you off the hook.

927
00:50:00.614 --> 00:50:03.197
There’s no getting off the hook,
Tommy.

928
00:50:03.197 --> 00:50:06.322
I’m responsible for the death
of a policeman.

929
00:50:06.322 --> 00:50:07.947
You had no choice.

930
00:50:07.947 --> 00:50:10.572
That’s not going to cut much
mustard, is it?

931
00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:12.864
And even if I can prove
what really happened,

932
00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:16.572
all that’s going to do is put me
in a deeper hole with the Chapmans.

933
00:50:16.572 --> 00:50:18.697
Come on, Charlie.

934
00:50:18.697 --> 00:50:20.614
BABY GURGLES

935
00:50:21.739 --> 00:50:24.489
And they’ve got plans for me,
one way or the other.

936
00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:34.697
I’d like...

937
00:50:34.697 --> 00:50:36.072
to report an assault.

938
00:50:38.197 --> 00:50:41.531
So we reconstructed Ackroyd’s
skull in the computer

939
00:50:41.531 --> 00:50:44.322
as to how it would have
been before the attack.

940
00:50:44.322 --> 00:50:47.281
Then we simulated blows with a
variety of objects that are commonly

941
00:50:47.281 --> 00:50:50.614
used in attacks like these. We’re
not getting very far, I’m afraid.

942
00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:54.239
None of the objects we tried caused
damage that matched what was

943
00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:57.072
actually there. We have worked out
a few things, though.

944
00:50:57.072 --> 00:50:59.864
It was a blunt weapon,
no edges of any kind.

945
00:50:59.864 --> 00:51:01.281
So circular like a baseball bat?

946
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:04.114
Yes, but not a baseball bat, we
tried one of those.

947
00:51:04.114 --> 00:51:06.906
It was wooden.
About 1.5 inches in diameter.

948
00:51:06.906 --> 00:51:09.864
You can stop talking about me,
I’m here now. Where have you been?

949
00:51:09.864 --> 00:51:13.031
I’ve been to see a man about a dog.
Are you going to get a dog, Steve?

950
00:51:13.031 --> 00:51:15.406
That’s a great idea.
Keep him company.

951
00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:16.989
Yeah, where’s Gerry?

952
00:51:16.989 --> 00:51:18.656
He took the baby home. Why?

953
00:51:18.656 --> 00:51:20.822
No reason. So what have we got?

954
00:51:20.822 --> 00:51:23.572
Well, the murder weapon is rounded,
made of wood

955
00:51:23.572 --> 00:51:25.239
and about 1.5 inches in diameter.

956
00:51:25.239 --> 00:51:27.031
And it’s not a baseball bat.

957
00:51:27.031 --> 00:51:29.572
It’s a police truncheon, isn’t it?

958
00:51:29.572 --> 00:51:32.406
Well, I presume you had the same
ones down here we had back up there

959
00:51:32.406 --> 00:51:35.072
in Glasgow before they brought in
the new ones with the handles?

960
00:51:35.072 --> 00:51:38.197
Actually, a truncheon’s not a bad
guess. So it could be a policeman?

961
00:51:38.197 --> 00:51:39.697
We don’t know who was handling it.

962
00:51:39.697 --> 00:51:42.239
How soon can they start digging
deeper into that basement?

963
00:51:42.239 --> 00:51:45.614
They’re still trying to pump the
water out, it could be later today,
or tomorrow.

964
00:51:45.614 --> 00:51:49.656
In the meantime,
I’ve tracked down that private
detective that Ackroyd hired.

965
00:51:49.656 --> 00:51:51.031
OK, let’s go and talk to him.

966
00:51:51.031 --> 00:51:52.614
Can I have a word?

967
00:51:56.031 --> 00:51:58.864
This is absurd!
I don’t know what to believe.

968
00:51:58.864 --> 00:52:01.239
You don’t believe that
Gerry Standing beat up a witness?!

969
00:52:01.239 --> 00:52:04.364
Where is Gerry? At his
daughter’s, looking after the baby.

970
00:52:05.531 --> 00:52:07.447
I think we should bring
the others in on this.

971
00:52:08.822 --> 00:52:10.156
You’re not serious?

972
00:52:10.156 --> 00:52:13.656
I find it difficult to believe
that Gerry Standing would
attack a witness.

973
00:52:13.656 --> 00:52:15.906
So this Sainsbury character is lying.

974
00:52:15.906 --> 00:52:18.614
This Sainsbury character is
a retired police officer,

975
00:52:18.614 --> 00:52:21.697
Danny, with a spotless record. That
mayjust mean he never got caught.

976
00:52:21.697 --> 00:52:23.031
Absolutely!

977
00:52:23.031 --> 00:52:25.906
If Ackroyd is about to blow the
whistle on police corruption, who’s

978
00:52:25.906 --> 00:52:28.947
to say that Sainsbury wasn’t going to
be one of the officers named?

979
00:52:28.947 --> 00:52:32.656
Actually, he claims the opposite.
He says Ackroyd was going
to name Gerry.

980
00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:38.197
This is ridiculous. It might not be.

981
00:52:38.197 --> 00:52:42.322
You asked me to follow Bryant
and McCabe the other night.

982
00:52:43.531 --> 00:52:46.156
So I followed them
around a load of pubs and clubs...

983
00:52:46.156 --> 00:52:48.864
You said nothing happened.

984
00:52:48.864 --> 00:52:50.656
They met up with Gerry.

985
00:52:50.656 --> 00:52:53.697
I don’t think it was arranged and it
certainly didn’t seem amicable.

986
00:52:53.697 --> 00:52:56.197
What were they talking about?
I don’t know, er,

987
00:52:56.197 --> 00:53:00.031
I just caught the tail end of the
conversation, but I heard Bryant
mention the name Naylor.

988
00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:02.531
As in Tommy Naylor. The gangster?

989
00:53:02.531 --> 00:53:05.156
I went to visit him earlier,
he said he’d never heard of Gerry.

990
00:53:05.156 --> 00:53:07.947
I think he’s lying.
You went to see Tommy Naylor? Yeah.

991
00:53:07.947 --> 00:53:10.781
You didn’t think any of this
was worth mentioning, Steve?

992
00:53:10.781 --> 00:53:13.072
Ijust wanted to be sure it meant
something before I...

993
00:53:13.072 --> 00:53:16.156
Did I miss the meeting
where we changed how police
investigations work?

994
00:53:16.156 --> 00:53:19.031
Was I off sick that day, or
something? Sasha... I’m your boss.

995
00:53:19.031 --> 00:53:22.572
You tell me where you’re going and
what you’re doing at all times.
This is about Gerry.

996
00:53:22.572 --> 00:53:25.656
This is an ongoing investigation
into the murder of a police officer.

997
00:53:25.656 --> 00:53:28.239
We do not go off—piste like this.

998
00:53:28.239 --> 00:53:29.697
Is that clear?

999
00:53:31.822 --> 00:53:33.614
Yes, sure, yeah. Sorry.

1000
00:53:34.781 --> 00:53:37.031
While we’re putting
our cards on the table...

1001
00:53:37.031 --> 00:53:38.614
0h, brilliant, what have you done?!

1002
00:53:38.614 --> 00:53:39.739
Nothing.

1003
00:53:42.197 --> 00:53:45.197
I think Gerry recognised
Ackroyd’s Signet ring

1004
00:53:45.197 --> 00:53:47.114
when we first saw it in the basement.

1005
00:53:47.114 --> 00:53:49.239
You think?!

1006
00:53:49.239 --> 00:53:51.739
He had an odd reaction to it.

1007
00:53:52.822 --> 00:53:54.531
On its own it’s nothing

1008
00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:57.614
but stacked up against this
accusation from Sainsbury,

1009
00:53:57.614 --> 00:54:01.031
the fact that Gerry has some
sort of ongoing situation

1010
00:54:01.031 --> 00:54:04.239
with Bryant and McCabe
that he’s keeping from us,

1011
00:54:04.239 --> 00:54:06.572
the possible involvement
with Tommy Naylor

1012
00:54:06.572 --> 00:54:10.364
and the fact that Fiona thinks
that Ackroyd may have been killed
by a police truncheon...

1013
00:54:10.364 --> 00:54:15.239
I’m sorry, what? Thisjust came
out before you arrived. 0K, wait.

1014
00:54:15.239 --> 00:54:18.406
This is Gerry Standing
we’re talking about.

1015
00:54:20.406 --> 00:54:23.281
Does any of this seem
remotely likely?

1016
00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:27.697
Sasha, none of us
knew Gerry Standing 30 years ago.

1017
00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:30.572
Is it a huge stretch to imagine that,
as a young man,

1018
00:54:30.572 --> 00:54:33.864
he might have got himself involved
in something monumentally stupid?

1019
00:54:33.864 --> 00:54:35.572
This is really dangerous ground.

1020
00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:38.781
If anyone outside of Ucos gets even
a whiff that Gerry Standing

1021
00:54:38.781 --> 00:54:42.239
might be compromised, this case
will be handed off to another team,

1022
00:54:42.239 --> 00:54:45.739
a team who won’t know Gerry and will
only look at this apparently

1023
00:54:45.739 --> 00:54:47.572
mounting evidence against him.

1024
00:54:47.572 --> 00:54:50.489
Then we should talk to Gerry,
get his side of this. Absolutely.

1025
00:54:50.489 --> 00:54:52.781
Steve, ask Gerry to come back in,
will you?

1026
00:54:52.781 --> 00:54:55.447
If he’s got something to hide, sir,
he might not respond to that.

1027
00:54:55.447 --> 00:54:57.531
Tell him it’s not a request!

1028
00:54:57.531 --> 00:54:59.656
The police want him to help
with their inquiries.

1029
00:55:02.656 --> 00:55:04.322
Hello, er, Bill?

1030
00:55:05.406 --> 00:55:06.656
Gerry Standing.

1031
00:55:07.656 --> 00:55:09.906
Yeah, I’m all right, yeah. You?

1032
00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:13.447
Yeah, we allare, mate, I’ll tell
you. Listen, it’sjust a quick one.

1033
00:55:13.447 --> 00:55:17.322
Do you remember a team that were
looking into the Chapman family
back in ‘83?

1034
00:55:19.239 --> 00:55:21.781
Yeah, that’s right, Sainsbury, yeah.

1035
00:55:21.781 --> 00:55:24.531
Yeah, I wondered if you had any
mates that were on the team...

1036
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:26.781
PHONE BUZZES
Hold on.

1037
00:55:29.822 --> 00:55:31.364
Sorry, another call.

1038
00:55:32.406 --> 00:55:36.156
I don’t suppose you know anybody who
might have known anybody?

1039
00:55:36.156 --> 00:55:37.447
No. All right.

1040
00:55:38.697 --> 00:55:40.822
No, it’s just a one-off,
don’t worry.

1041
00:55:40.822 --> 00:55:43.239
Cheers, yeah. See you soon.
Ta-ra.

1042
00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:45.197
Come on, you.

1043
00:55:57.531 --> 00:56:00.031
DS McCabe, DS Bryant.

1044
00:56:01.406 --> 00:56:03.614
Lovely to see you again.

1045
00:56:03.614 --> 00:56:05.864
Don’t remember the invite being
a plus-one.

1046
00:56:05.864 --> 00:56:08.072
This is Gerry Standing.

1047
00:56:08.072 --> 00:56:11.531
How do you do, Gerry? Do you know
who I am?

1048
00:56:11.531 --> 00:56:13.031
You’re Dominic Chapman.

1049
00:56:13.031 --> 00:56:15.447
That’s right.

1050
00:56:15.447 --> 00:56:20.322
Dad sends his apologies — said
there was something on telly.

1051
00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:21.447
Right.

1052
00:56:24.031 --> 00:56:27.864
Some little toerags knocked over
a jeweller’s in Knightsbridge
last week.

1053
00:56:27.864 --> 00:56:30.697
This establishment was supposed
to be under our protection.

1054
00:56:30.697 --> 00:56:33.697
The toerags in question have been
caught and dealt with

1055
00:56:33.697 --> 00:56:35.031
but the job was put together

1056
00:56:35.031 --> 00:56:37.822
by someone who’s becoming a bit
of a thorn in our side.

1057
00:56:37.822 --> 00:56:40.322
Dad would like you to raid
this guy’s establishment,

1058
00:56:40.322 --> 00:56:42.072
retrieve our belongings

1059
00:56:42.072 --> 00:56:43.322
and nick the little bastard —

1060
00:56:43.322 --> 00:56:46.197
and should you decide to bounce his
head off the pavement a few times

1061
00:56:46.197 --> 00:56:48.781
on the way to the nick, I don’t
think anyone would be too upset.

1062
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:50.281
Are we taking out your rubbish now?

1063
00:56:52.697 --> 00:56:56.489
I think someone could do with a few
lessons in not speaking when he’s
being spoken to.

1064
00:56:58.031 --> 00:56:59.906
You’re making the world
a safer place

1065
00:56:59.906 --> 00:57:04.156
and getting a few Brownie points
from your bosses on the bust,
Mr Standing.

1066
00:57:04.156 --> 00:57:06.406
Everyone’s a winner.

1067
00:57:06.406 --> 00:57:07.447
What’s the name?

1068
00:57:07.447 --> 00:57:10.156
Naylor, Tommy Naylor.

1069
00:57:23.906 --> 00:57:25.947
BABY CRIES

1070
00:57:37.281 --> 00:57:40.197
It’s all right, it’s OK.

1071
00:57:48.072 --> 00:57:50.281
It’s one thing taking a hung
to look the other way —

1072
00:57:50.281 --> 00:57:54.572
but we’re talking about Chapman
paying cops to go and do his dirty
work for him.

1073
00:57:54.572 --> 00:57:56.281
Well, here.

1074
00:57:56.281 --> 00:57:58.031
Did what you said.

1075
00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:01.406
That’s all the money they’ve given
me. Names, dates, places — the lot.

1076
00:58:01.406 --> 00:58:03.447
We need to take that upstairs
to Sainsbury.

1077
00:58:03.447 --> 00:58:06.406
We need to think this through.
Bollocks, we’ve got to do something!

1078
00:58:06.406 --> 00:58:08.572
I’ll take it upstairs meself.
To who?

1079
00:58:08.572 --> 00:58:10.531
Who do we trust up there?

1080
00:58:10.531 --> 00:58:12.906
You think Bryant and McCabe are
the most senior officers

1081
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:14.197
on Chapman’s payroll?

1082
00:58:15.531 --> 00:58:17.197
Then what?

1083
00:58:17.197 --> 00:58:19.322
I need to sound people out,

1084
00:58:19.322 --> 00:58:22.822
work out who’s with us and
who’s against us.

1085
00:58:22.822 --> 00:58:24.031
And in the meantime?

1086
00:58:26.156 --> 00:58:28.656
I don’t know, Gerry.

1087
00:58:28.656 --> 00:58:30.614
I’m sorry.

1088
00:58:30.614 --> 00:58:32.072
Just leave it with me.

1089
00:58:35.614 --> 00:58:36.656
Here we are.

1090
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:42.114
Are you sure this is the place?

1091
00:58:42.114 --> 00:58:44.031
Well, what were you expecting?

1092
00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:49.781
A battered office door with
"R Woolcott, Investigator" painted
on the louvre glass pane?

1093
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:51.447
A sassy broad in reception?

1094
00:59:00.489 --> 00:59:03.114
Hello. Hi, is Mr Woolcott in,
please?

1095
00:59:03.114 --> 00:59:05.197
I’m afraid he died.

1096
00:59:05.197 --> 00:59:08.197
Oh, I’m sorry. That’s OK,

1097
00:59:08.197 --> 00:59:09.781
it was about A0 years ago.

1098
00:59:09.781 --> 00:59:12.781
Mr R Woolcott, he was a
private detective.

1099
00:59:12.781 --> 00:59:15.031
Mr T Woolcott, my father.

1100
00:59:15.031 --> 00:59:18.364
I’m Rachael Woolcott, the private
detective as was.

1101
00:59:18.364 --> 00:59:20.531
0h, Isee.

1102
00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:22.197
May we come in, please?

1103
00:59:22.197 --> 00:59:24.781
Yeah, yes, of course. Thank you.

1104
00:59:24.781 --> 00:59:27.197
Yes, I was only a private detective
for a couple of years

1105
00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:30.489
in the early ‘80s, then I got
into security systems,

1106
00:59:30.489 --> 00:59:31.864
you know, high—end stuff.

1107
00:59:33.406 --> 00:59:35.489
That’s what pays the bills.

1108
00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:38.781
You had a client back then in 1983,
Martin Ackroyd?

1109
00:59:40.739 --> 00:59:43.572
The policeman? You’ve got
a good memory.

1110
00:59:43.572 --> 00:59:46.447
Well, he didn’t pay me. Those are
the ones you remember.

1111
00:59:46.447 --> 00:59:48.906
There’s possibly a reason for that.

1112
00:59:48.906 --> 00:59:51.322
He went missing a week after
he hired you.

1113
00:59:51.322 --> 00:59:52.947
We believe he was murdered.

1114
00:59:52.947 --> 00:59:55.614
Oh, dear. 0h, lam sorry.

1115
00:59:55.614 --> 00:59:57.072
What did he hire you to do?

1116
00:59:59.531 --> 01:00:01.406
It was a divorcejob, I think.

1117
01:00:01.406 --> 01:00:04.031
He wanted me to follow his wife,

1118
01:00:04.031 --> 01:00:07.114
take note of everywhere she went
and take pictures.

1119
01:00:07.114 --> 01:00:10.114
Mostly my bread and butter
was serving legal papers

1120
01:00:10.114 --> 01:00:11.447
and looking at accounts,

1121
01:00:11.447 --> 01:00:14.364
so this was easily the most exciting
thing I’d ever been offered

1122
01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:16.072
so Ijumped at it.

1123
01:00:16.072 --> 01:00:19.114
Ackroyd’s wife? Died, 2007.

1124
01:00:19.114 --> 01:00:20.239
Was she having an affair?

1125
01:00:20.239 --> 01:00:23.114
Oh, yes. Who with?

1126
01:00:23.114 --> 01:00:25.989
No idea. I mean, Igot pictures
of the guy

1127
01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.531
but the next step was to show
the pictures to the client

1128
01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:31.364
on the assumption that
he’d recognise him.

1129
01:00:31.364 --> 01:00:33.822
And you didn’t get that far because
Ackroyd disappeared?

1130
01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:36.072
Exactly. I know this was
30 years ago

1131
01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:38.947
and well before digital photographs
and computerised records...

1132
01:00:38.947 --> 01:00:41.406
Yes, I have everything.

1133
01:00:41.406 --> 01:00:43.989
I’m a hoarder, fortunately for you.

1134
01:00:43.989 --> 01:00:45.947
Everything’s in boxes
up in the attic.

1135
01:00:45.947 --> 01:00:47.281
Would you be able to...

1136
01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:50.031
What, make you some coffee while
you search through it all?

1137
01:00:51.072 --> 01:00:52.072
Certainly.

1138
01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:55.031
Hm!

1139
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.447
Tonight’s the night, Gerald.

1140
01:01:02.447 --> 01:01:04.531
What? The Naylor raid.

1141
01:01:04.531 --> 01:01:08.406
Tommy Naylor goes down tonight. We’ll
get the jewellery from his safe,

1142
01:01:08.406 --> 01:01:12.197
dust our knuckles a little bit, then
off down the Queen’s Head after,

1143
01:01:12.197 --> 01:01:14.614
so you should all home and get
a late pass.

1144

When’s he back?

1148
01:01:42.822 --> 01:01:46.072
No, that’s no good. I need
to speak to him today.

1149
01:01:46.072 --> 01:01:48.572
Have you got a number for
where he’s staying?

1150
01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:50.281
No, I don’t want to speak
to anyone else.

If anyone ever asks, this
conversation never happened.

The safe, it’s empty.

01:02:28.697 --> 01:02:29.697
Hmm?

Well, I’ll say one thing for her —

1163
01:02:51.947 --> 01:02:53.906
these are marvellous boxes.

1164
01:02:53.906 --> 01:02:55.072
Glad you like them.

1165
01:02:57.781 --> 01:02:59.697
Ah, found the "A"s.

1166
01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:04.197
A—ha.

1167
01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.406
Ackroyd, here we are.

1168
01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:13.114
Well, this is awkward.

1169
01:03:13.114 --> 01:03:14.364
Who was she shagging?

1170
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.031
PHONE RINGS

1171
01:03:35.656 --> 01:03:37.697
MUFFLED MUSIC

1172
01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:57.656
You’ve been a naughty boy, Gerald.

1173
01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:15.447
We’ve got some problems,
I understand.

1174
01:04:15.447 --> 01:04:19.031
A copper who doesn’t know
who he’s working for

1175
01:04:19.031 --> 01:04:22.364
and a friend who’s got a little bit
too big for his boots.

1176
01:04:24.739 --> 01:04:26.656
Tommy...

1177
01:04:26.656 --> 01:04:30.072
next time you think you can have
one over on the Chapman family,

1178
01:04:30.072 --> 01:04:33.072
I suggest you take a long look
in the mirror.

1179
01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:37.239
NAYLOR SHOUTS OUT

1180
01:04:37.239 --> 01:04:39.281
SCREAMING

1181
01:04:41.572 --> 01:04:44.281
Give him a kicking and
dump him somewhere.

1182
01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:47.406
NAYLOR GROANS

1183
01:04:56.322 --> 01:04:58.781
I’m not allowed to kill anyone
at the moment —

1184
01:04:58.781 --> 01:05:01.156
Dad says it’s bad for business.

1185
01:05:01.156 --> 01:05:02.781
There’s still fun to be had, though.

1186
01:05:02.781 --> 01:05:04.697
Better not lay a finger on me.

1187
01:05:04.697 --> 01:05:06.239
Or what?

1188
01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:08.406
It’s all documented.

1189
01:05:08.406 --> 01:05:11.864
Everything you’ve paid to these
two in the last three months.

1190
01:05:11.864 --> 01:05:14.656
This is all about to come crashing
down around your ears.

1191
01:05:14.656 --> 01:05:17.822
Anything you do to me now is
only going to make it worse.
