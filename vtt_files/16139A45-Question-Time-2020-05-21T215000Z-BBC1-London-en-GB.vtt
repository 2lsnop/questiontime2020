00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.807
the conversation is always on social
media. Our first question is from

39
00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:06.974
media. Our first question is from
Clare Cooper.

40
00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:09.390
Even if some children do get
back to school before

41
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.057
the end of the summer term,
their experience is more likely

42
00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:14.432
to be about hygiene and social
distancing rather than anything

43
00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:19.432
of educational value.

44
00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:23.599
What can the panel suggest for
a whole generation of schoolchildren

45
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.515
who have now missed nearly half
an academic year and face months

46
00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:30.182
of distrust about every social
contact and the constant threat

47
00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:35.224
of closure again?

48
00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.390
Andy, let’s start with you for top
obviously some schools are going to

49
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.557
obviously some schools are going to
go back on the 1st of

50
00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:45.140
obviously some schools are going to
go back on the 1st ofJune and some

51
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.932
go back on the 1st of june and some
are not.

52
00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:48.890
go back on the 1st ofJune and some
are not. What’s happening where you

53
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.599
are not. what’s happening where you
are? It’s a

54
00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:51.182
are not. What’s happening where you
are? It’s a mixed picture, Fiona.

55
00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:53.057
are? It’s a mixed picture, Fiona.
Some are going back and some have

56
00:01:53.057 --> 00:01:53.557
Some are going back and some have
said therd

57
00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:54.390
Some are going back and some have
said they’d rather take their time

58
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.557
said therd rather take their time
to get the

59
00:01:55.557 --> 00:01:56.057
said they’d rather take their time
to get the right arrangements in

60
00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:56.557
to get the right arrangements in
place, but

61
00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:56.765
to get the right arrangements in
place, butl

62
00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:57.932
to get the right arrangements in
place, but I agree we want to get

63
00:01:57.932 --> 00:02:00.599
place, but I agree we want to get
the kids back in school if we can,

64
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.307
the kids back in school if we ran,
as quickly as

65
00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:02.224
the kids back in school if we can,
as quickly as possible, but it has

66
00:02:02.224 --> 00:02:04.349
as quickly as possible, but it has
to be done as safely as possible,

67
00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.349
to be done as safely as possible,
and the key thing is that schools

68
00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.724
and the key thing is that schools
haven’t closed. It’s as if they

69
00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:07.932
haven’t dosed. It’s as if they
haven’t

70
00:02:07.932 --> 00:02:08.807
haven’t closed. It’s as if they
haven’t been doing anything, but

71
00:02:08.807 --> 00:02:10.599
haven’t been doing anything, but
they have been looking after

72
00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.765
they have been looking after
children of key workers. I think

73
00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:17.307
children of key workers. I think
teachers are feeling a bit stressed

74
00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:18.807
teachers are feeling a bit stressed
from the teacher bashing they have

75
00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:20.015
from the teacher bashing they have
seen this week, so

76
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:20.432
from the teacher bashing they have
seen this week, sol

77
00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.390
from the teacher bashing they have
seen this week, so I think we need

78
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.265
seen this week, so I think we need
to de—escalate this row of it. The

79
00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:24.015
to tie-escalate this row of it. The
problem is the

80
00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:24.724
to de—escalate this row of it. The
problem is the government dropped a

81
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:26.682
problem is the government dropped a
date on people of the 1st of

82
00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:26.807
problem is the government dropped a
date on people of the 1st ofJune

83
00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:27.307
date on peopla of the 1st of june
about any

84
00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:28.015
date on people of the 1st ofJune
about any real consultation, and I

85
00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.515
about any real consultation, and I
think the way to resolve this is to

86
00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:30.724
think the way to resolve this is to
55V

87
00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:33.349
think the way to resolve this is to
say to head teachers,

88
00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.432
think the way to resolve this is to
say to headteachers, in

89
00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:35.265
say to headteachers, in
consultation with councils, try and

90
00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:36.432
consultation with councils, try and
get back by the 1st of

91
00:02:36.432 --> 00:02:36.974
consultation with councils, try and
get back by the 1st ofJune but as

92
00:02:36.974 --> 00:02:37.682
get back by the 1st of june but as
soon as you

93
00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:39.515
get back by the 1st ofJune but as
soon as you feel is safe, and that

94
00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:40.932
soon as you feel is safe, and that
feels to me to be the right

95
00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:45.390
feels to me to be the right
resolution and where we are today.

96
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.099
resolution and where we are today.
I’ve got three school—age children,

97
00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.849
I’ve got three school-age children,
a year six child,

98
00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.307
I’ve got three school—age children,
a year six child, a year to mark her

99
00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:51.015
a year six child, a year to mark her
child and a year five child, so one

100
00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:51.890
child and a year five child, so one
of them can

101
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.390
child and a year five child, so one
of them ran go

102
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.765
child and a year five child, so one
of them can go back, the one in year

103
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:54.307
of them ran go back, the one in year
six, and I’ve

104
00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.099
of them can go back, the one in year
six, and I’ve been asked by her

105
00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.890
six, and I’ve been asked by her
school if I want her to go back and

106
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.724
school if I want her to go back and
I said yes, so we have half term and

107
00:02:58.724 --> 00:03:00.224
I said yes, so we have half term and
then I will have one of my three

108
00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:02.307
then I will have one of my three
children back and the other two at

109
00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:02.682
children hack and the other two at
home, which

110
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.265
children back and the other two at
home, which consequently means one

111
00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.515
home, which consequently means one
of us needs to be at home with the

112
00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:07.932
of us needs to be at home with the
children, so work can’t go back to

113
00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:10.557
children, so work can’t go back to
normal if I had been asked if all of

114
00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:11.765
normal if I had been asked if all of
the children should go back, I’d

115
00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:14.224
the children should go back, I’d
have said yes. You don’t have the

116
00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:16.932
have said yes. You don’t have the
safety fears we heard from some

117
00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:20.640
safety fears we heard from some
teachers and some unions? Not really

118
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.349
teachers and some unions? Not really
because I’ve been impressed so far

119
00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.765
because I’ve been impressed so far
with what schools have come up with

120
00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:25.349
with what schools have come up with
in terms of how they are going to

121
00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.849
in terms of how they are going to
socially distance children and

122
00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.515
socially distance children and
measures they are going to take. We

123
00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:31.182
measures they are going to take. We
had a massive dossier talking about

124
00:03:31.182 --> 00:03:32.265
had a massive dossier talking about
washing hands and temperature checks

125
00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:34.724
washing hands and temperature checks
at the door and how they are going

126
00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:35.890
at the door and how they are going
to be separated in class, but

127
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.182
to be separated in class, but
equally, and I know there is a lack

128
00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:40.432
equally, and I know there is a lack
of consensus over the evidence that

129
00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:43.932
of consensus over the evidence that
we have so far as to how infectious

130
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.349
we have so far as to how infectious
children are, it’s plausible that

131
00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.515
children are, it’s plausible that
they are not as infectious as

132
00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:49.349
they are not as infectious as
adults, but perhaps not proven, but

133
00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.765
adults, but perhaps not proven, but
there have been a number of studies,

134
00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:53.057
there have been a number of studies,
studies in Australia, in Finland,

135
00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:55.474
studies in Australia, in Finland,
studies of a child who interacted

136
00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:59.307
studies of a child who interacted
after coming back from the French

137
00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:00.557
after coming back from the French
Alps and having coronavirus with

138
00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:01.432
Alps and having coronavirus with
hundreds of other children and

139
00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:04.724
hundreds of other children and
didn’t pass it on. The chief

140
00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:05.890
didn’t pass it on. The chief
scientists of the WHO have said

141
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.849
scientists of the WHO have said
schools should go back. We have seen

142
00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.182
schools should go back. We have seen
schools go back in parts of Europe I

143
00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.807
schools go back in parts of Europe I
did a story with the BMA this week

144
00:04:11.807 --> 00:04:14.765
did a story with the BMA this week
which cited the spike in northern

145
00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:16.474
which cited the spike in northern
France, but actually the Foreign

146
00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:17.807
France, but actually the Foreign
Minister there pointed out that 1.4

147
00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:19.640
Minister there pointed out that 1.4
million children had come back,

148
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.724
million children had come back,
there had been 70 cases but most had

149
00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:25.390
there had been 70 cases but most had
been contracted outside school.

150
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.557
been contracted outside school.
Initially the BMA were supporting

151
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:27.807
Initially the BMA were supporting
unions in saying that schools should

152
00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:31.099
unions in saying that schools should
not ever the Telegraph ran a piece

153
00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.807
not ever the Telegraph ran a piece
with them yesterday where they

154
00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:33.849
with them yesterday where they
somewhat softened their stance and

155
00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.432
somewhat softened their stance and
said that schools should go back on

156
00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:36.307
said that schools should go back on
june the 1st if

157
00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:37.640
said that schools should go back on
June the 1st if it is safe to do so

158
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.057
june the 1st if it is safe to do so
so, from

159
00:04:38.057 --> 00:04:39.974
June the 1st if it is safe to do so
so, from some of the evidence I have

160
00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:40.390
so, from some of the evidence I have
seen, I

161
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.015
so, from some of the evidence I have
seen, Ifeel happy

162
00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:42.307
so, from some of the evidence I have
seen, I feel happy with my eldest go

163
00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:43.682
seen, I feel happy with my eldest go
back and, if the other two were

164
00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:46.515
back and, if the other two were
invited to go back, I’d say yes. I

165
00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:48.015
invited to go back, I’d say yes. I
have sympathy with teachers but we

166
00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:49.640
have sympathy with teachers but we
have to consider that the infection

167
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.099
have to consider that the infection
rate before lockdown came in would

168
00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:51.515
rate before lockdown fame in would
have

169
00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:53.307
rate before lockdown came in would
have been higher than it was now,

170
00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:55.099
have been higher than it was now,
and arguably teachers could be more

171
00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.765
and arguably teachers could be more
at risk going to the supermarket and

172
00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:58.349
at risk going to the supermarket and
into classrooms. I think measures

173
00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.557
into classrooms. I think measures
should be taken, but I am satisfied

174
00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:03.682
should be taken, but I am satisfied
we have got to the point, and I

175
00:05:03.682 --> 00:05:04.724
we have got to the point, and I
believe that Sage, which informed

176
00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:06.432
believe that Sage, which informed
government it was the right time to

177
00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:06.640
government it was the right time to
55V

178
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.765
government it was the right time to
say a phased return to school from

179
00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:09.432
say a phased return to school from
june the 1st, I

180
00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:10.599
say a phased return to school from
June the 1st, I understand they will

181
00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:10.682
june the 1st, I understand they will
release

182
00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:11.390
June the lst, I understand they will
release more of their

183
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.724
June the ist, I understand they will
release more of their evidence

184
00:05:11.724 --> 00:05:13.599
release more of their evidence
tomorrow first up we need to see

185
00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.640
tomorrow first up we need to see
that evidence. So far it’s not been

186
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.849
that evidence. So far it’s not been
transparent enough, which has led to

187
00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.474
transparent enough, which has lad to
confusion.

188
00:05:19.474 --> 00:05:20.765
transparent enough, which has led to
confusion. Lets talk about the

189
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:21.682
confusion. Lets talk about the
Denmark experience, because Denmark

190
00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:23.224
Denmark experience, because Denmark
was the first country in Europe to

191
00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:27.057
was the first country in Europe to
reopen its schools. Why was the

192
00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:27.265
reopen its schools. why was the
decision

193
00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:28.182
reopen its schools. Why was the
decision taken, and how has it

194
00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:32.265
decision taken, and how has it
worked? I think it’s hard to compare

195
00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.307
worked? I think it’s hard to compare
the UK with Denmark. Denmark is a

196
00:05:34.307 --> 00:05:35.724
the UK with Denmark. Denmark is a
much smaller country and we have a

197
00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:37.140
much smaller country and we have a
different political system, which I

198
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.807
different political system, which I
hope I ran

199
00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:39.557
different political system, which I
hope I can talk a bit more about

200
00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:39.932
hope I ran talk a bit more about
based on

201
00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:41.307
hope I can talk a bit more about
based on much more compromise,

202
00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:45.849
based on much more compromise,
consultation, and we could never

203
00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.474
consultation, and we could never
send children back to school without

204
00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:48.557
send children back to school without
deep consultation with unions and

205
00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:49.724
deep consultation with unions and
head teachers

206
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:49.974
deep consultation with unions and
headteachers and

207
00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:50.599
deep consultation with unions and
head teachers and also parents, of

208
00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.015
head teachers and also parents, of
course.

209
00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:55.099
headteachers and also parents, of
course. But they succeeded in

210
00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.057
course. But they succeeded in
sending children back, and one thing

211
00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:58.724
sending children back, and one thing
I was really impressed with, and as

212
00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:00.307
I was really impressed with, and as
Prime Minister I had my fair share

213
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:03.265
Prime Minister I had my fair share
of debates with the teaching unions,

214
00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:04.974
of debates with the teaching unions,
but one thing I was really impressed

215
00:06:04.974 --> 00:06:07.390
but one thing I was really impressed
by was how innovative they suddenly

216
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.349
by was how innovative they suddenly
became. They invented new ways of

217
00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.265
became. They invented new ways of
going to school. They had outdoor

218
00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:16.932
going to school. They had outdoor
school, Copenhagen teamed up with

219
00:06:16.932 --> 00:06:19.974
school, Copenhagen teamed up with
cultural facilities all over town

220
00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:22.015
cultural facilities all over town
suddenly you saw kids having

221
00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:26.932
suddenly you saw kids having
education in our national stadium,

222
00:06:26.932 --> 00:06:28.599
education in our national stadium,
they start singing the national

223
00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.807
they start singing the national
anthem and after that they had their

224
00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.224
anthem and after that they had their
class in the VIP lounge, you saw

225
00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:32.474
class in the VIP lounge, you saw
five-year-old

226
00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:33.807
class in the VIP lounge, you saw
five—year—old kids having their

227
00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:34.099
five-year-old kids having their
education,

228
00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.640
five—year—old kids having their
education, having their classroom in

229
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.015
education, having their classroom in
the museum, the national museum of

230
00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:41.932
the museum, the national museum of
art. Kane so you think we could do

231
00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:45.057
art. Kane so you think we could do
that sort of thing here is to mock

232
00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:47.265
that sort of thing here is to mock
why not? We have empty theatres,

233
00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:48.599
why not? We have empty theatres,
museums and sports facilities so why

234
00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.807
museums and sports facilities so why
not use them to give a different

235
00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:55.349
not use them to give a different
kind of education? What I’m singing

236
00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:55.432
kind of education? what I’m singing
Danish

237
00:06:55.432 --> 00:06:56.515
kind of education? What I’m singing
Danish schools, yesterday I saw a

238
00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:00.599
Danish schools, yesterday I saw a
report about children getting

239
00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:01.849
report about children getting
sailing education in the sea. 50

240
00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:02.099
report about children getting
sailing education in the sea. So why

241
00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.682
sailing education in the sea. So why
not actually use this time to think

242
00:07:04.682 --> 00:07:07.015
not actually use this time to think
differently about education and team

243
00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:08.765
differently about education and team
up, but it ran

244
00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:09.807
differently about education and team
up, but it can only be done by local

245
00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:11.224
up, but it can only be done by local
authorities. It can’t be dictated

246
00:07:11.224 --> 00:07:12.599
authorities. It can’t be dictated
that the and that’s another reason

247
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.224
that the and that’s another reason
why I think the government needs to

248
00:07:15.224 --> 00:07:19.432
why I think the government needs to
have much more consultation with the

249
00:07:19.432 --> 00:07:20.599
have much more consultation with the
four nations of this country, with

250
00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.265
four nations of this country, with
[oral

251
00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:23.932
four nations of this country, with
local authorities, with cities, to

252
00:07:23.932 --> 00:07:24.015
[oral authorities, with cities, to
make

253
00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:25.682
local authorities, with cities, to
make sure this can happen in a

254
00:07:25.682 --> 00:07:26.099
make sure this ran happen in a
smooth way,

255
00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.057
make sure this can happen in a
smooth way, and I would really

256
00:07:27.057 --> 00:07:27.224
smooth way, and Iwould really
advise

257
00:07:27.224 --> 00:07:29.515
smooth way, and I would really
advise to take the heat out of this,

258
00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.724
advise to take the heat out of this,
because nothing good comes from this

259
00:07:31.724 --> 00:07:33.307
because nothing good comes from this
row which we have seen in the last

260
00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:35.307
row which we have seen in the last
week. james,

261
00:07:35.307 --> 00:07:36.265
row which we have seen in the last
week. James, your mother works in a

262
00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:38.682
week. james, your mother works in a
school. She

263
00:07:38.682 --> 00:07:39.682
week. James, your mother works in a
school. She has an office manager in

264
00:07:39.682 --> 00:07:41.265
school. She has an office manager in
a primary school in Nottinghamshire,

265
00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:43.182
a primary school in Nottinghamshire,
doing a lot of the things we are

266
00:07:43.182 --> 00:07:43.974
doing a lot of the things we are
talking about, making these

267
00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:45.932
talking about, making these
preparations. They are nervous but

268
00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.890
preparations. They are nervous but
they are trying to adapt and be

269
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.474
they are trying to adapt and be
inventive. She has been ordering

270
00:07:49.474 --> 00:07:52.015
inventive. She has been ordering
pedal bins for tissues for when kids

271
00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:53.307
pedal bins for tissues for when kids
sneeze. They have been measuring out

272
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.349
sneeze. They have been measuring out
how the desks might work in

273
00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.807
how the desks might work in
classrooms, but it’s important to

274
00:07:57.807 --> 00:07:57.974
classrooms, but it’s important to
55V

275
00:07:57.974 --> 00:07:59.140
classrooms, but it’s important to
say that every local authority is

276
00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.349
say that every [oral authority is
totally

277
00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:00.224
say that every local authority is
totally different and every school

278
00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:04.474
totally different and every school
is totally different. There are big

279
00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:06.724
is totally different. There are big
and small classes, there are areas

280
00:08:06.724 --> 00:08:08.140
and small classes, there are areas
of great resource and great

281
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.724
of great resource and great
deprivation, and I think it’s

282
00:08:09.724 --> 00:08:11.974
deprivation, and I think it’s
incumbent on our politicians to

283
00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.057
incumbent on our politicians to
empower headmasters and teachers,

284
00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:15.265
empower headmasters and teachers,
because they know what is best for

285
00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:16.640
because they know what is best for
the children in their schools and I

286
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.265
the children in their schools and I
don’t necessarily see the need for

287
00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:21.265
don’t necessarily see the need for
uniform a standardised, nationwide

288
00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:21.640
uniform a standardised, nationwide
roll-out. I

289
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.515
uniform a standardised, nationwide
roll—out. I think the dates and

290
00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:22.724
roll-out. I think the dates and
times

291
00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:24.557
roll—out. I think the dates and
times and methods need to be decided

292
00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:27.140
times and methods need to be decided
by the teachers. But I love what you

293
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:32.432
by the teachers. But I love what you
said about using cultural

294
00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:33.515
said about using cultural
institutions to contribute to the

295
00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:35.682
institutions to contribute to the
positive learning of children stop I

296
00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.140
positive learning of children stop I
think it was mentioned in the

297
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.724
think it was mentioned in the
question, we have a whole generation

298
00:08:38.724 --> 00:08:40.849
question, we have a whole generation
who are set at home with these

299
00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:41.974
who are set at home with these
incredibly eager minds and the

300
00:08:41.974 --> 00:08:43.724
incredibly eager minds and the
desire to be learning, and I think

301
00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:44.390
desire to be learning, and I think
that is

302
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.599
desire to be learning, and I think
that is one thing that the theatre

303
00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:46.932
that is one thing that the theatre
industry in its lockdown has been

304
00:08:46.932 --> 00:08:49.849
industry in its lockdown has been
reasonably good at, and education

305
00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:50.849
reasonably good at, and education
departments have been continuing to

306
00:08:50.849 --> 00:08:53.682
departments have been continuing to
function and to work with teachers

307
00:08:53.682 --> 00:08:55.640
function and to work with teachers
to get actor sat at home to

308
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.140
to get actor sat at home to
musicians at to inspire kids in that

309
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.849
musicians at to inspire kids in that
way. Unfortunately, we will not be

310
00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:02.682
way. Unfortunately, we will not be
able to open any time soon, and I

311
00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:04.265
able to open any time soon, and I
think it’s incumbent on us to try

312
00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:07.224
think it’s incumbent on us to try
and find as inventive and exciting

313

314
00:09:07.432 --> 00:09:08.432
and find as inventive and exciting
way to keep kids stimulated as

315
00:09:08.432 --> 00:09:11.640
way to keep kids stimulated as
possible. The 1st of

316
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:11.807
way to keep kids stimulated as
possible. The 1st ofJune

317
00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:12.057
possible. The 1st of June
announcement

318
00:09:12.057 --> 00:09:13.057
possible. The 1st ofJune
announcement has turned into a bit

319
00:09:13.057 --> 00:09:15.640
announcement has turned into a bit
of a mess, hasn’t it? You heard Andy

320
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.932
of a mess, hasn’t it? You heard Andy
saying there was no consultation,

321
00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.390
saying there was no consultation,
and we were talking about trying to

322
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.807
and we were talking about trying to
take the heat out of it. Now we have

323
00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:21.932
take the heat out of it. Now we have
a situation where the 1st of

324
00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:22.849
take the heat out of it. Now we have
a situation where the 1st ofJune,

325
00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:23.807
a situation where the 1st of june,
at the

326
00:09:23.807 --> 00:09:25.015
a situation where the 1st ofJune,
at the moment, there will be up to

327
00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:27.682
at the moment, there will be up to
2000 schools not opening, so this

328
00:09:27.682 --> 00:09:27.849
2000 schools not opening, so this
roll-out

329
00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:28.599
2000 schools not opening, so this
roll—out the government wanted isn’t

330
00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:30.015
roll-out the government wanted isn’t
going to

331
00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:32.474
roll—out the government wanted isn’t
going to happen. I think there was

332
00:09:32.474 --> 00:09:33.599
going to happen. I think there was
plenty of advance notice. The

333
00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:34.974
plenty of advance notice. The
measure was announced a few weeks

334
00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.015
measure was announced a few weeks
ago in response to scientific

335
00:09:36.015 --> 00:09:41.807
ago in response to scientific
advice. As Camilla said, there is a

336
00:09:41.807 --> 00:09:42.849
advice. As Camilla said, there is a
load more advice and scientific

337
00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:45.432
load more advice and scientific
evidence to be published tomorrow to

338
00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:47.307
evidence to be published tomorrow to
look at. On the point about the

339
00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:49.807
look at. On the point about the
constituent nations of the UK,

340
00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:50.015
constituent nations of the UK,
Walas,

341
00:09:50.015 --> 00:09:50.890
constituent nations of the UK,
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland

342
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.307
Walas, Northern Ireland and Scotland
chart

343
00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:53.807
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland
chart their own course, but as far

344
00:09:53.807 --> 00:09:55.015
chart their own course, but as far
as England is concerned we are

345
00:09:55.015 --> 00:09:58.015
as England is concerned we are
following the advice we have been

346
00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.515
following the advice we have been
given strip it is really important

347
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.682
given strip it is really important
when safe to get children back into

348
00:10:01.682 --> 00:10:02.932
when safe to get children back into
school for exactly the reason that

349
00:10:02.932 --> 00:10:05.390
school for exactly the reason that
was mentioned in the question. I am

350
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.265
was mentioned in the question. I am
worried there are children that are

351
00:10:08.265 --> 00:10:09.265
worried there are children that are
missing out on education,

352
00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:09.765
missing out on education,
particularly children from

353
00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:12.849
particularly children from
disadvantaged backgrounds who are at

354
00:10:12.849 --> 00:10:14.349
disadvantaged backgrounds who are at
risk of falling behind in their

355
00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:16.682
risk of falling behind in their
studies, so as soon as we safely can

356
00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.640
studies, so as soon as we safely ran
I think it’s

357
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640
studies, so as soon as we safely can
I think it’s important to get

358
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.390
I think it’s important to get
children back into the classroom. Of

359
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.099
children back into the classroom. Of
course, at no point are we going to

360
00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:25.015
course, at no point are we going to
take any risk with anyone’s health,

361
00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:25.224
take any risk with anyone’s health,
children,

362
00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:25.932
take any risk with anyone’s health,
children, teachers, parents or

363
00:10:25.932 --> 00:10:28.140
children, teachers, parents or
anyone. The advice will get

364
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.807
anyone. The advice will get
published tomorrow and they will be

365
00:10:29.807 --> 00:10:31.557
published tomorrow and they will be
further confirmation, I think,

366
00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:31.724
published tomorrow and they will be
further confirmation, Ithink, next

367
00:10:31.724 --> 00:10:34.182
further confirmation, Ithink, next
week. If it is safe to go back on

368
00:10:34.182 --> 00:10:35.057
week. If it is safe to go back on
june the 1st, as

369
00:10:35.057 --> 00:10:35.515
week. If it is safe to go back on
June the 1st, as we currently

370
00:10:35.515 --> 00:10:37.140
june the 1st, as we currently
believe

371
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.932
June the 1st, as we currently
believe it is, might encourage

372
00:10:37.932 --> 00:10:38.224
June the lst, as we currently
believe it is, might encourage all

373
00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:40.807
believe it is, might encourage all
schools to do that in a safe way to

374
00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.182
schools to do that in a safe way to
make sure children don’t fall

375
00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:44.474
make sure children don’t fall
behind. We don’t want any child to

376
00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:45.432
behind. We don’t want any child to
get left behind, especially those

377
00:10:45.432 --> 00:10:47.807
get left behind, especially those
from disadvantaged backgrounds. Do

378
00:10:47.807 --> 00:10:50.765
from disadvantaged backgrounds. Do
you think it would be more likely to

379
00:10:50.765 --> 00:10:52.224
you think it would be more likely to
be successful if head teachers had

380
00:10:52.224 --> 00:10:53.349
be successful if head teachers had
known about the 1st of

381
00:10:53.349 --> 00:10:53.765
be successful if head teachers had
known about the 1st ofJune before

382
00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:54.099
known about the 1st of june before
it was

383
00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:55.182
known about the 1st ofJune before
it was announced to the nation at

384
00:10:55.182 --> 00:10:57.432
it was announced to the nation at
large? The union of head teachers

385
00:10:57.432 --> 00:10:58.807
large? The union of head teachers
said the first they knew about it

386
00:10:58.807 --> 00:11:00.265
said the first they knew about it
was on the television. There are

387
00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:02.182
was on the television. There are
thousands of head teachers and tens

388
00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:05.807
thousands of head teachers and tens
of hundreds of teachers, so it’s

389
00:11:05.807 --> 00:11:06.724
of hundreds of teachers, so it’s
difficult to selectively announce it

390
00:11:06.724 --> 00:11:11.724
difficult to selectively announce it
to that number of people. Hang on,

391
00:11:11.724 --> 00:11:12.265
to that number of peopla. Hang on,
that’s the

392
00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:12.849
to that number of people. Hang on,
that’s the Department for Education,

393
00:11:12.849 --> 00:11:14.515
that’s the Department for Education,
that it’s only what they can do! Are

394
00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:15.849
that it’s only what they ran do! Are
you saying the

395
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:16.557
that it’s only what they can do! Are
you saying the only way to tell

396
00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:17.640
you saying the only way to tell
schools or through a press

397
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.515
schools or through a press
conference? If you make an

398
00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:22.224
conference? If you make an
announcement to 10,000 teachers, you

399
00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:22.932
announcement to 10,000 teachers, you
are effectively announcing publicly,

400
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.849
are effectively announcing publicly,
and teaching unions have been

401
00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:28.390
and teaching unions have been
closely consulted about the science,

402
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.849
closely consulted about the science,
they have been on cells where the

403
00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:30.932
they have been on falls where the
government’s

404
00:11:30.932 --> 00:11:31.515
they have been on cells where the
government’s scientific advisers

405
00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:33.640
government’s scientific advisers
have briefed them on that, and I

406
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.724
have briefed them on that, and I
would urge teaching unions their

407
00:11:34.724 --> 00:11:37.432
would urge teaching unions their
members to positively and

408
00:11:37.432 --> 00:11:38.182
members to positively and
constructively engage with schools

409
00:11:38.182 --> 00:11:40.974
constructively engage with schools
to find safe ways of going back. As

410
00:11:40.974 --> 00:11:41.432
to find safe ways of going back. As
james said,

411
00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:42.640
to find safe ways of going back. As
James said, that will be different

412
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:42.807
james said, that will be different
for

413
00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:43.932
James said, that will be different
for different schools, because of

414
00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:45.099
for different schools, because of
their geography and classroom

415
00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:46.224
their geography and classroom
layouts being different, but the

416
00:11:46.224 --> 00:11:48.640
layouts being different, but the
important thing is we make sure no

417
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.057
important thing is we make sure no
child gets left behind, and I’d like

418
00:11:50.057 --> 00:11:50.849
child gets left behind, and I’d like
to add to what

419
00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:51.932
child gets left behind, and I’d like
to add to whatJames said that the

420
00:11:51.932 --> 00:11:53.432
to add to whatjames said that the
idea of seeing

421
00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:54.640
to add to whatJames said that the
idea of seeing if we can use empty

422
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:54.849
idea of seeing if we ran use empty
cultural

423
00:11:54.849 --> 00:11:55.932
idea of seeing if we can use empty
cultural institutions is really

424
00:11:55.932 --> 00:11:58.474
cultural institutions is really
interesting and that is worth

425
00:11:58.474 --> 00:11:59.932
interesting and that is worth
exploring because, sadly, many of

426
00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:00.849
exploring because, sadly, many of
our great institutions like theatres

427
00:12:00.849 --> 00:12:02.599
our great institutions like theatres
and museums are not being used and,

428
00:12:02.599 --> 00:12:03.224
and museums are not being used and,
if we ran

429
00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:04.807
and museums are not being used and,
if we can find a way of safely

430
00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:05.057
if we ran find a way of safely
getting

431
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.765
if we can find a way of safely
getting children into them, it would

432
00:12:06.765 --> 00:12:07.849
getting children into them, it would
be a great and enriching experience

433
00:12:07.849 --> 00:12:12.432
be a great and enriching experience
for them. I want what parents are

434
00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:14.099
for them. I want what parents are
supposed to make of this. A number

435
00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.515
supposed to make of this. A number
of schools are embracing, happy or

436
00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:18.140
of schools are embracing, happy or
not, it’s difficult to say, but are

437
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.474
not, it’s difficult to say, but are
planning to go ahead with the ist of

438
00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:21.807
planning to go ahead with the 1st of
june opening,

439
00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.432
planning to go ahead with the 1st of
June opening, and lots of schools

440
00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:23.849
june opening, and lots of schools
that are

441
00:12:23.849 --> 00:12:24.765
June opening, and lots of schools
that are not. What are parents

442
00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:25.390
that are not. what are parents
supposed to

443
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.015
that are not. What are parents
supposed to make of it? Is it that

444
00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:28.849
supposed to make of it? Is it that
some schools are less risk averse

445
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:29.432
some schools are lass risk averse
than

446
00:12:29.432 --> 00:12:30.849
some schools are less risk averse
than others, or some are better

447
00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:31.932
than others, or some are better
prepared? How can parents make any

448
00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:32.224
prepared? How ran parents make any
decent

449
00:12:32.224 --> 00:12:36.224
prepared? How can parents make any
decent assessment? I think they are

450
00:12:36.224 --> 00:12:38.390
decent assessment? I think they are
probably a bit bemused, to be

451
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.640
probably a bit bemused, to be
honest, because it’s a row that’s

452
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.807
honest, because it’s a row that’s
been going on for the last few days

453
00:12:41.807 --> 00:12:43.349
been going on for the last few days
and I’m not sure that helps parents.

454
00:12:43.349 --> 00:12:48.099
and I’m not sure that helps parents.
I would agree with Helle

455
00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:48.932
and I’m not sure that helps parents.
I would agree with Helle, but head

456
00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:50.474
I would agree with Helle, but head
teachers in the driving seat and let

457
00:12:50.474 --> 00:12:51.849
teachers in the driving seat and let
them make the judgment about when

458
00:12:51.849 --> 00:12:53.682
them make the judgment about when
it’s safe to open the school,

459
00:12:53.682 --> 00:12:54.849
it’s safe to open the school,
because parents will probably look

460
00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:55.807
because parents will probably look
most to the head

461
00:12:55.807 --> 00:12:55.932
because parents will probably look
most to the headteacher

462
00:12:55.932 --> 00:12:56.390
because parents will probably look
most to the head teacher for advice

463
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.224
most to the head teacher for advice
about the safety of their kids. I

464
00:12:59.224 --> 00:13:00.807
about the safety of their kids. I
think it should also be done in

465
00:13:00.807 --> 00:13:03.224
think it should also be done in
consultation with local councillors,

466
00:13:03.224 --> 00:13:04.182
consultation with local councillors,
because the fact is that

467
00:13:04.182 --> 00:13:05.140
because the fact is that
circumstances will differ from one

468
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.682
circumstances will differ from one
place to another in terms of the

469
00:13:06.682 --> 00:13:09.557
place to another in terms of the
teaching staff, some of them might

470
00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:11.807
teaching staff, some of them might
be self—isolating them there might

471
00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:12.015
be self-isolating them there might
be

472
00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:12.182
be self—isolating them there might
beissues

473
00:13:12.182 --> 00:13:15.515
be self—isolating them there might
be issues they have to deal with.

474
00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:17.807
be issues they have to deal with.
There will be physical circumstances

475
00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:21.807
There will be physical circumstances
different in every school, but don’t

476
00:13:21.807 --> 00:13:24.015
different in every school, but don’t
forget that the R rate, the

477
00:13:24.015 --> 00:13:25.432
forget that the R rate, the
reproduction number varies from one

478
00:13:25.432 --> 00:13:27.807
reproduction number varies from one
region to another. In the north, we

479
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.265
region to another. In the north, we
have seen a higher R number ten in

480
00:13:30.265 --> 00:13:32.182
have seen a higher R number ten in
the south so you can’t blame any

481
00:13:32.182 --> 00:13:33.057
the south so you can’t blame any
council for taking a cautious

482
00:13:33.057 --> 00:13:36.265
council for taking a cautious
approach. That is what I say to the

483
00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:39.474
approach. That is what I say to the
government that work in partnership

484
00:13:39.474 --> 00:13:40.432
government that work in partnership
with local councils and absolutely

485
00:13:40.432 --> 00:13:40.599
with local councils and absolutely
55V

486
00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:42.974
with local councils and absolutely
say to them, get schools open on the

487
00:13:42.974 --> 00:13:44.390
say to them, get schools open on the
1st of june if we

488
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.015
say to them, get schools open on the
1st ofJune if we can, but we

489
00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:45.474
1st ofjune if we ran, but we
respect the

490
00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:46.474
1st ofJune if we can, but we
respect the fact that, if you think

491
00:13:46.474 --> 00:13:48.432
respect the fact that, if you think
a bit longer as needed to get

492
00:13:48.432 --> 00:13:50.515
a bit longer as needed to get
arrangements in place, so be it, and

493
00:13:50.515 --> 00:13:52.307
arrangements in place, so be it, and
we will work in partnership on that.

494
00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:54.265
we will work in partnership on that.
Lets get away from teacher bashing.

495
00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:56.057
Lets get away from teacher bashing.
We have seen too much of that in the

496
00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:57.265
We have seen too much of that in the
last few weeks. They have been

497
00:13:57.265 --> 00:13:59.807
last few weeks. They have been
working really hard through this

498
00:13:59.807 --> 00:14:03.474
working really hard through this
period, often teaching kids at home,

499
00:14:03.474 --> 00:14:04.807
period, often teaching kids at home,
being innovative in all of the ways

500
00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:06.515
being innovative in all of the ways
you would want them to be, and I

501
00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:09.015
you would want them to be, and I
think we need to de—escalate this

502
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:09.474
think we need to de-esralate this
row and

503
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.557
think we need to de—escalate this
row and focus on practical steps to

504
00:14:10.557 --> 00:14:11.849
row and focus on practical steps to
get kids back in school when it’s

505
00:14:11.849 --> 00:14:16.807
get kids back in school when it’s
safe. Some comments on social media,

506
00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:16.974
safe. Some comments on social media,
Lawrence

507
00:14:16.974 --> 00:14:17.390
safe. Some comments on social media,
lawrence says, if

508
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:17.765
safe. Some comments on social media,
Lawrence says, if it’s safer

509
00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:19.140
Lawrence says, if it’s safer
children to go back to school, why

510
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.599
children to go back to school, why
isn’t it safe for the House of

511
00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:24.849
isn’t it safe for the House of
Commons? We had a vote in Parliament

512
00:14:24.849 --> 00:14:25.265
Commons? We had a vote in Partiament
yesterday and,

513
00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:26.515
Commons? We had a vote in Parliament
yesterday and, from June the 2nd

514
00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:26.807
yesterday and, from june the 2nd
onwards,

515
00:14:26.807 --> 00:14:29.807
yesterday and, from June the 2nd
onwards, these arrangements to vote

516
00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:31.682
onwards, these arrangements to vote
remotely are being ended and we will

517
00:14:31.682 --> 00:14:33.432
remotely are being ended and we will
be going back in, because it is

518
00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:34.890
be going back in, because it is
important that our national

519
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:35.390
important that our national
Parliament does its

520
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:35.599
important that our national
Parliament does itsjob,

521
00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:37.724
Parliament does its job,
scrutinising what the government is

522
00:14:37.724 --> 00:14:37.932
scmtinising what the government is
doing,

523
00:14:37.932 --> 00:14:41.640
scrutinising what the government is
doing, properly asking questions

524
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:41.932
doing, property asking questions
things like

525
00:14:41.932 --> 00:14:43.015
doing, properly asking questions
things like bill committees and

526
00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:43.807
things like bill committees and
delegated Legislation committees

527
00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:46.307
delegated Legislation committees
have not been sitting, so let’s get

528
00:14:46.307 --> 00:14:47.390
have not been sitting, so let’s get
Parliament working, showing

529
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.682
Parliament working, showing
leadership and doing what we are

530
00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:50.140
leadership and doing what we are
asking everybody else to do, go to

531
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.307
asking everybody else to do, go to
work if you safely can. And D. I

532
00:14:54.307 --> 00:14:54.807
work if you safely ran. And D. I
think it

533
00:14:54.807 --> 00:14:56.599
work if you safely can. And D. I
think it was a really poor decision

534
00:14:56.599 --> 00:15:00.140
think it was a really poor decision
taken by MPs this week. We are not

535
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.182
taken by MPs this week. We are not
asking schools to come fully back.

536
00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:05.140
asking schools to come fully back.
We are asking them to come back on

537
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.432
We are asking them to come back on
an interim basis. For Parliament to

538
00:15:06.432 --> 00:15:06.807
an interim basis. For Partiament to
vote to

539
00:15:06.807 --> 00:15:09.015
an interim basis. For Parliament to
vote to come back completely, I

540
00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:11.224
vote to come back completely, I
think, sets a really poor example to

541
00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:13.015
think, sets a really poor example to
the country, and let’s remember

542
00:15:13.015 --> 00:15:14.349
the country, and let’s remember
Westminster was a hotbed for the

543
00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:16.015
Westminster was a hotbed for the
spread of the virus just a few weeks

544
00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:20.182
spread of the virus just a few weeks
ago. Sometimes in Parliament, it’s a

545
00:15:20.182 --> 00:15:20.890
ago. Sometimes in Partiament, it’s a
use of do

546
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.182
ago. Sometimes in Parliament, it’s a
case of do as we say, not as we do,

547
00:15:23.182 --> 00:15:23.974
rase of do as we say, not as we do,
and I don’t

548
00:15:23.974 --> 00:15:24.599
case of do as we say, not as we do,
and I don’t think it’s acceptable.

549
00:15:24.599 --> 00:15:24.807
and I don’t think it’s acceptabla.
It

550
00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:26.724
and I don’t think it’s acceptable.
It doesn’t suggest to me that the

551
00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:27.807
It doesn’t suggest to me that the
premier workplace in the country are

552
00:15:27.807 --> 00:15:33.390
premier workplace in the country are
taking a safety first approach. Just

553
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.557
taking a safety first approach. just
to

554
00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:35.057
taking a safety first approach. Just
to correct that, we will not be

555
00:15:35.057 --> 00:15:37.015
to correct that, we will not be
functioning as normal, there will be

556
00:15:37.015 --> 00:15:37.807
functioning as normal, there will be
different arrangements for things

557
00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:39.140
different arrangements for things
like voting, so it will not be

558
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.640
like voting, so it will not be
business as usual but MPs will be

559
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.015
business as usual but MPs will be
doing their

560
00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:45.432
business as usual but MPs will be
doing theirjob. In the question, I

561
00:15:45.432 --> 00:15:46.474
doing theirjob. In the question, I
think Claire Cooper. About the

562
00:15:46.474 --> 00:15:47.682
think Claire Cooper. About the
wellbeing of children and the sense

563
00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.682
wellbeing of children and the sense
that it will be different when they

564
00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.682
that it will be different when they
go back, they will be social

565
00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:53.015
go back, they will be social
distancing, and I don’t quite know

566
00:15:53.015 --> 00:15:54.807
distancing, and I don’t quite know
how the curriculum might match up to

567
00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:56.390
how the curriculum might match up to
what it might have been if we were

568
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.640
what it might have been if we were
not in this situation, but the

569
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.640
not in this situation, but the
bottom line is that children miss

570
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.557
bottom line is that children miss
their friends and that social

571
00:16:01.557 --> 00:16:03.224
their friends and that social
interaction and, for children that

572
00:16:03.224 --> 00:16:04.807
interaction and, for children that
have been all right at home and are

573
00:16:04.807 --> 00:16:06.640
have been all right at home and are
in safe and loving homes, they have

574
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.265
in safe and loving homes, they have
been 0K and maybe they can last

575
00:16:08.265 --> 00:16:08.390
been 0K and maybe they ran last
until

576
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.724
been 0K and maybe they can last
until September without much damage.

577
00:16:10.724 --> 00:16:12.807
until September without much damage.
It has happened here is that the

578
00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:14.182
It has happened here is that the
government expected 20% attendance

579
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:14.432
government expected 2096 attendance
levels

580
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.807
government expected 20% attendance
levels at schools throughout

581
00:16:16.807 --> 00:16:18.765
levels at schools throughout
knock—down they hoped that all

582
00:16:18.765 --> 00:16:20.724
knock—down they hoped that all
vulnerable children and a lot of

583
00:16:20.724 --> 00:16:21.807
vulnerable children and a lot of
children of key workers were

584
00:16:21.807 --> 00:16:23.015
children of key workers were
detained, and what happened was less

585
00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:23.390
detained, and what happened was less
than 296

586
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.640
detained, and what happened was less
than 2% of children attended, and

587
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:26.932
than 296 of children attended, and
I’m quite

588
00:16:26.932 --> 00:16:27.807
than 2% of children attended, and
I’m quite involved with a charity

589
00:16:27.807 --> 00:16:28.265
I’m quite involved with a charity
rallad

590
00:16:28.265 --> 00:16:29.057
I’m quite involved with a charity
called the national association for

591
00:16:29.057 --> 00:16:29.265
rallad the national association for
the

592
00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:31.224
called the national association for
the children of alcoholics, and

593
00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:31.432
the children of alcoholic, and
their

594
00:16:31.432 --> 00:16:32.432
the children of alcoholics, and
their calls are going through the

595
00:16:32.432 --> 00:16:35.015
their calls are going through the
roof. I did a show with Esther

596
00:16:35.015 --> 00:16:35.265
roof. I did a show with Fsther
Rantzen

597
00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:37.224
roof. I did a show with Esther
Rantzen the other day and she was

598
00:16:37.224 --> 00:16:38.432
Rantzen the other day and she was
saying Childline had been inundated.

599
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:41.015
saying Childline had been inundated.
We have to weigh up the risks. Yes,

600
00:16:41.015 --> 00:16:44.140
We have to weigh up the risks. Yes,
there is a risk to children perhaps

601
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.057
there is a risk to children perhaps
of contracting Covid—19 and

602
00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:45.640
of contracting Covid-19 and
spreading

603
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.349
of contracting Covid—19 and
spreading it to vulnerable adults,

604
00:16:46.349 --> 00:16:48.224
spreading it to vulnerable adults,
and that’s not something we want,

605
00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:50.640
and that’s not something we want,
but what is the risk to vulnerable

606
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.765
but what is the risk to vulnerable
children from moaning in homes where

607
00:16:51.765 --> 00:16:55.349
children from moaning in homes where
they may be facing abuse or other

608
00:16:55.349 --> 00:16:59.557
they may be facing abuse or other
problems which greatly affect their

609
00:16:59.557 --> 00:16:59.807
problams which greatly affect their
wellbeing

610
00:16:59.807 --> 00:17:00.599
problems which greatly affect their
wellbeing much more than being

611
00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:01.807
wellbeing much more than being
socially distancing a classroom for

612
00:17:01.807 --> 00:17:04.015
socially distancing a classroom for
from remaining in homes. That’s an

613
00:17:04.015 --> 00:17:07.015
from remaining in homes. That’s an
important point that what is the

614
00:17:07.015 --> 00:17:07.974
important point that what is the
consequence for children who can’t

615
00:17:07.974 --> 00:17:12.224
consequence for children who can’t
go to school? I knew that very well

616
00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:14.265
go to school? I knew that very well
when I was CEO of Save the Children.

617
00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:16.182
when I was CEO of Save the Children.
If children don’t go to school, they

618
00:17:16.182 --> 00:17:17.224
If children don’t go to school, they
forget everything they learned, the

619
00:17:17.224 --> 00:17:20.015
forget everything they learned, the
full year, so we will have children

620
00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:23.015
full year, so we will have children
who practically lives a whole year

621
00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:23.265
who practically lives a whola year
of

622
00:17:23.265 --> 00:17:24.390
who practically lives a whole year
of education because they simply

623
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.724
of education because they simply
can’t remember what they learnt six

624
00:17:25.724 --> 00:17:29.224
can’t remember what they learnt six
months ago. So I am a bit worried

625
00:17:29.224 --> 00:17:31.140
months ago. So I am a bit worried
that it will last too long and we

626
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.432
that it will last too long and we
will be handing, taking a bit of the

627
00:17:34.432 --> 00:17:37.224
will be handing, taking a bit of the
children’s future twice. First, we

628
00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:38.640
children’s future twice. First, we
take almost a year of their

629
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.849
take almost a year of their
education and then we are also

630
00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:42.307
education and then we are also
handing them a very large bill for a

631
00:17:42.307 --> 00:17:44.890
handing them a very large bill for a
lockdown which has become very

632
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.682
lockdown which has become very
expensive, so these balances, but I

633
00:17:48.682 --> 00:17:50.724
expensive, so these balances, but I
would again say find a good balance

634
00:17:50.724 --> 00:17:52.932
would again say find a good balance
with also the teachers and take the

635
00:17:52.932 --> 00:17:55.432
with also the teachers and take the
heat out of it. The only way this

636
00:17:55.432 --> 00:17:55.807
heat out of it. The only way this
ran be

637
00:17:55.807 --> 00:18:01.140
heat out of it. The only way this
can be solved is by being pragmatic.

638
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:09.182
Clare, what is your view? I quite
like the idea that Helle had about

639
00:18:09.182 --> 00:18:10.640
like the idea that Helle had about
using the news creatively, the value

640
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.057
using the news creatively, the value
of education will have been taken

641
00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:13.557
of education will have been taken
away from children and I think this

642
00:18:13.557 --> 00:18:15.807
away from children and I think this
is every child, it is children from

643
00:18:15.807 --> 00:18:18.015
is every child, it is children from
reception right up to the sixth

644
00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:20.515
reception right up to the sixth
formers who are losing out on their

645
00:18:20.515 --> 00:18:21.265
formers who are losing out on their
A-levels. I

646
00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:23.432
formers who are losing out on their
A—levels. I am grieving because of

647
00:18:23.432 --> 00:18:24.390
A-levels. I am grieving because of
that, actually,

648
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.474
A—levels. I am grieving because of
that, actually, but also I think

649
00:18:25.474 --> 00:18:29.057
that, actually, but also I think
what I fear is that children, there

650
00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:30.890
what I fear is that children, there
will be a distrust about social

651
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.182
will be a distrust about social
contact. At this term maybe but

652
00:18:34.182 --> 00:18:37.390
contact. At this term maybe but
going into the next academic year

653
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.224
going into the next academic year
and I think the value and the trust,

654
00:18:40.224 --> 00:18:42.807
and I think the value and the trust,
the way that schools where before

655
00:18:42.807 --> 00:18:46.474
the way that schools where before
they broke up in the middle of

656
00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:48.724
they broke up in the middle of
March, has disappeared and I feel

657
00:18:48.724 --> 00:18:49.099
March, has disappeared and Ifeel
profoundly

658
00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:52.432
March, has disappeared and I feel
profoundly sad and worried for the

659
00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:55.099
profoundly sad and worried for the
children. I am a psychologist,

660
00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:55.432
profoundly sad and worried for the
children. lam a psychologist, I

661
00:18:55.432 --> 00:18:57.807
children. lam a psychologist, I
don’t work in education, but I can

662
00:18:57.807 --> 00:18:58.224
don’t work in education, but I ran
see the

663
00:18:58.224 --> 00:18:59.432
don’t work in education, but I can
see the psychological damage that

664
00:18:59.432 --> 00:19:00.682
see the psychological damage that
potentially is happening to a whole

665
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.515
potentially is happening to a whole
generation of children. Clare, thank

666
00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:05.057
generation of children. Clare, thank
you very much for your question and

667
00:19:05.057 --> 00:19:05.932
you very much for your question and
thank you for

668
00:19:05.932 --> 00:19:07.140
you very much for your question and
thank you forjoining us live. Let

669
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.890
thank you for joining us live. Let
us go to Alfie

670
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.682
thank you forjoining us live. Let
us go to Alfie now. He has another

671
00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:12.099
us go to Alfie now. He has another
question. Yes.

672
00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:15.015
Test, track and trace sounds really,
really important, but what will be

673
00:19:15.015 --> 00:19:18.099
in place on the ist ofJune will be
missing many components including

674
00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:19.640
the contact tracing app.

675
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.599
When are we likely to see the test,
track and trace fully implemented?

676
00:19:29.765 --> 00:19:32.307
Of course it is full implementation,

677
00:19:32.307 --> 00:19:33.015
Of course it is full implamentation,
according to

678
00:19:33.015 --> 00:19:33.640
Of course it is full implementation,
according to the government anyway,

679
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.807
according to the government anyway,
that is critical in terms of easing

680
00:19:37.807 --> 00:19:39.474
that is critical in terms of easing
the lockdown and getting children

681
00:19:39.474 --> 00:19:41.099
the lockdown and getting children
back to school. When are we going to

682
00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:41.432
back to school. when are we going to
see test

683
00:19:41.432 --> 00:19:42.474
back to school. When are we going to
see test track and trace fully

684
00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:43.057
see test track and trace fully
implement it, not

685
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.599
see test track and trace fully
implement it, notjust the

686
00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:46.932
implement it, notjust the
beginnings of it, but fully

687
00:19:46.932 --> 00:19:48.474
beginnings of it, but fully
implemented? We have seen the new

688
00:19:48.474 --> 00:19:48.640
implemented? We have seen the new
aPP

689
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.849
implemented? We have seen the new
app being tested on the Isle of

690
00:19:49.849 --> 00:19:50.015
app being tested on the Isle of
Wight

691
00:19:50.015 --> 00:19:50.182
app being tested on the Isle of
Night and

692
00:19:50.182 --> 00:19:51.182
app being tested on the Isle of
Wight and we have learned from that

693
00:19:51.182 --> 00:19:51.474
Night and we have learned from that
experience

694
00:19:51.474 --> 00:19:52.682
Wight and we have learned from that
experience and one of the things we

695
00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:54.640
experience and one of the things we
have learned is that we can

696
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.432
have learned is that we can
effectively deploy test track and

697
00:19:56.432 --> 00:19:58.682
effectively deploy test track and
trace with the manual tracers. We

698
00:19:58.682 --> 00:19:59.807
trace with the manual tracers. We
have recruited 2A,000 of those

699
00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:00.265
have recruited 24,000 of those
already and

700
00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:01.932
have recruited 2A,000 of those
already and we will be up to the

701
00:20:01.932 --> 00:20:03.849
already and we will be up to the
full complement of 25,000 by the lst

702
00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:05.432
full complement of 25,000 by the 1st
of june and the

703
00:20:05.432 --> 00:20:05.557
full complement of 25,000 by the 1st
ofJune and the service

704
00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:06.057
full complement of 25,000 by the lst
ofJune and the service will be

705
00:20:06.057 --> 00:20:06.224
of june and the service will be
fully

706
00:20:06.224 --> 00:20:07.474
ofJune and the service will be
fully operational on the lst of

707
00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:07.682
ofJune and the service will be
fully operational on the lst ofJune

708
00:20:07.682 --> 00:20:08.474
fully operational on the 1st of june
and able

709
00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:10.307
fully operational on the 1st ofJune
and able to track and trace 10,000

710
00:20:10.307 --> 00:20:11.265
and able to track and trace 10,000
peopla a day,

711
00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.015
and able to track and trace 10,000
people a day, that is four times

712
00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:12.474
peopla a day, that is four times
more roughly

713
00:20:12.474 --> 00:20:13.724
people a day, that is four times
more roughly than the number of

714
00:20:13.724 --> 00:20:14.349
more roughly than the number of
rases we

715
00:20:14.349 --> 00:20:15.849
more roughly than the number of
cases we are finding each day from

716
00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:16.682
cases we are finding each day from
the 1st of june

717
00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:17.099
cases we are finding each day from
the 1st ofJune onwards. We

718
00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:17.390
cases we are finding each day from
the ist ofJune onwards. We think

719
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.099
the 1st of june onwards. We think
the app will

720
00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:20.432
the 1st ofJune onwards. We think
the app will be ready to deploy a

721
00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:22.932
the app will be ready to deploy a
few weeks after that but they are

722
00:20:22.932 --> 00:20:24.015
few weeks after that but they are
complimentary and the system will

723
00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.182
complimentary and the system will
work comprehensively from the 1st of

724
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:25.974
work comprehensively from the 1st of
june which is

725
00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:26.807
work comprehensively from the 1st of
June which is one of the government

726
00:20:26.807 --> 00:20:27.182
june which is one of the government
because my

727
00:20:27.182 --> 00:20:28.724
June which is one of the government
because my critical test and it will

728
00:20:28.724 --> 00:20:30.974
because my critical test and it will
help us learn more about the way the

729
00:20:30.974 --> 00:20:33.349
help us learn more about the way the
disease spreads, it will help its

730
00:20:33.349 --> 00:20:34.807
disease spreads, it will help its
stop spreading any further and it is

731
00:20:34.807 --> 00:20:36.224
stop spreading any further and it is
an important step forward in the way

732
00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:38.640
an important step forward in the way
we are dealing with this disease. It

733
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.640
we are dealing with this disease. It
is good news. There have been a

734
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.724
is good news. There have been a
number of deadlines that have

735
00:20:41.724 --> 00:20:41.890
number of deadlines that have
sUpped

736
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.307
number of deadlines that have
slipped but you sound very confident

737
00:20:45.307 --> 00:20:46.890
slipped but you sound very confident
and possibly rightly so. Very

738
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.432
and possibly rightly so. Very
confident that on the 1st of

739
00:20:48.432 --> 00:20:48.807
and possibly rightly so. Very
confident that on the 1st ofJune it

740
00:20:48.807 --> 00:20:49.640
confident that on the 1st of june it
is going to hit

741
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.807
confident that on the ist ofJune it
is going to hit the ground running.

742
00:20:53.807 --> 00:20:54.432
is going to hit the ground mnning.
South

743
00:20:54.432 --> 00:20:56.224
is going to hit the ground running.
South Korea is cited as a great

744
00:20:56.224 --> 00:20:57.349
South Korea is cited as a great
example of contact tracing and they

745
00:20:57.349 --> 00:20:58.057
example of contact tracing and they
had a ﬂare-up

746
00:20:58.057 --> 00:20:59.932
example of contact tracing and they
had a flare—up in a nightclub at the

747
00:20:59.932 --> 00:21:00.432
had a ﬂare-up in a nightclub at the
beginning of

748
00:21:00.432 --> 00:21:03.182
had a flare—up in a nightclub at the
beginning of the month and they

749
00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:06.057
beginning of the month and they
traced 65,000 people defied 170 new

750
00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.224
traced 65,000 people defied 170 new
infections and each one was

751
00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:08.890
infections and each one was
quarantined. Is that the kind of

752
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.057
quarantined. Is that the kind of
level of contact tracing the

753
00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:12.599
level of contact tracing the
government will be able to do from

754
00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:13.224
government will be able to do from
the 1st of

755
00:21:13.224 --> 00:21:15.474
government will be able to do from
the lst ofJune? The capacity will

756
00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:15.807
the 1st of june? The capacity will
be 10,000

757
00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.224
the 1st ofJune? The capacity will
be 10,000 traces every day and the

758
00:21:17.224 --> 00:21:18.890
be 10,000 traces every day and the
Prime Minister in the House of

759
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.099
Prime Minister in the House of
Commons on Wednesday was absolutely

rategoric that we are ready to go on
the 1st of june

763
00:21:22.724 --> 00:21:24.140
categoric that we are ready to go on

764
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.307
the 1st of june and we need 25,000
people to do it,

765
00:21:25.307 --> 00:21:25.849
the 1st ofJune and we need 25,000
people to do it, 2A,000 of those

766
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:26.099
peopla to do it, 24,000 of those
have

767
00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:27.932
people to do it, 2A,000 of those
have been recruited already and we

768
00:21:27.932 --> 00:21:30.057
have been recruited already and we
will get to 25,000 by the lst of

769
00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:30.807
will get to 25,000 by the 1st of
june and we

770
00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:32.099
will get to 25,000 by the lst of
June and we will get there. Even if

771
00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:33.307
june and we will get there. Even if
we do not

772
00:21:33.307 --> 00:21:34.515
June and we will get there. Even if
we do not have the app? It seems to

773
00:21:34.515 --> 00:21:38.640
we do not have the app? It seems to
be having a teething problems. It

774
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:38.807
be having a teething problams. It
has

775
00:21:38.807 --> 00:21:40.224
be having a teething problems. It
has been tested in the Isle of

776
00:21:40.224 --> 00:21:42.015
has been tested in the Isle of
Wight. Having the app is not

777
00:21:42.015 --> 00:21:42.557
Wight. Having the app is not
critical for this?

778
00:21:42.557 --> 00:21:43.140
Wight. Having the app is not
criticalforthis? It

779
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.349
Wight. Having the app is not
critical for this? It sounded

780
00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:43.599
Wight. Having the app is not
criticalfor this? It sounded like

781
00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:43.890
critical for this? It sounded like
it was

782
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.057
criticalfor this? It sounded like
it was the next big thing. The

783
00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.474
it was the next big thing. The
experience in the Isle of Wight

784
00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:50.224
experience in the Isle of Wight
shows you can do effective contact

785
00:21:50.224 --> 00:21:52.015
shows you can do effective contact
tracing without it but it is

786
00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:53.432
tracing without it but it is
obviously helpful and adds to it and

787
00:21:53.432 --> 00:21:55.557
obviously helpful and adds to it and
we will get it in a few weeks. At

788
00:21:55.557 --> 00:21:57.765
we will get it in a few weeks. At
the same time there are other

789
00:21:57.765 --> 00:21:59.224
the same time there are other
innovations happening, Matt Hancock

790
00:21:59.224 --> 00:22:00.807
innovations happening, Matt Hancock
this afternoon talked about a new

791
00:22:00.807 --> 00:22:04.140
this afternoon talked about a new
test been deployed today which gives

792
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.599
test been deployed today which gives
you a result within 20 minutes and

793
00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:08.599
you a result within 20 minutes and
we have heard about advances with

794
00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:10.224
we have heard about advances with
antibody testing as well and the

795
00:22:10.224 --> 00:22:11.432
antibody testing as well and the
science is really beginning to catch

796
00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:11.640
science is really beginning to catch
“P

797
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.474
science is really beginning to catch
up with this disease and for me, the

798
00:22:13.474 --> 00:22:16.349
up with this disease and for me, the
science is what really gives me hope

799
00:22:16.349 --> 00:22:18.557
science is what really gives me hope
for the future. Hope that we can

800
00:22:18.557 --> 00:22:19.015
for the future. Hope that we ran
move beyond

801
00:22:19.015 --> 00:22:19.474
for the future. Hope that we can
move beyond the strange

802
00:22:19.474 --> 00:22:20.932
move beyond the strange
circumstances of the last few weeks

803
00:22:20.932 --> 00:22:22.474
circumstances of the last few weeks
and return to something of a normal

804
00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:27.599
and return to something of a normal
life as the months go by. Helle, we

805
00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:28.015
life as the months go by. Hello, we
look at

806
00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.432
life as the months go by. Helle, we
look at the example of Denmark which

807
00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:33.515
look at the example of Denmark which
has blazed a trail in return to

808
00:22:33.515 --> 00:22:35.224
has blazed a trail in return to
normality, either you had no doubts

809
00:22:35.224 --> 00:22:37.807
normality, either you had no doubts
at that point, possibly one, where

810
00:22:37.807 --> 00:22:40.932
at that point, possibly one, where
is the UK started after 350 deaths.

811
00:22:40.932 --> 00:22:42.682
is the UK started after 350 deaths.
Your lockdown only lasted one month

812
00:22:42.682 --> 00:22:46.057
Your lockdown only lasted one month
and you have now eased it. In terms

813
00:22:46.057 --> 00:22:47.599
and you have now eased it. In terms
of test, track and trace, how

814
00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:49.099
of test, track and trace, how
important was that in terms of

815
00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:52.599
important was that in terms of
Denmark been able to cope? It is

816
00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:54.224
Denmark been able to cope? It is
very hard and it would be difficult

817
00:22:54.224 --> 00:22:55.807
very hard and it would be difficult
to find someone who thought it was a

818
00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:59.182
to find someone who thought it was a
good idea to wait a good week in the

819
00:22:59.182 --> 00:23:00.682
good idea to wait a good week in the
UK to lock down. The lockdown Sibley

820
00:23:00.682 --> 00:23:00.807
UK to lock down. The lockdown Sibley
fame

821
00:23:00.807 --> 00:23:02.349
UK to lock down. The lockdown Sibley
came too light in this country and I

822
00:23:02.349 --> 00:23:06.224
came too light in this country and I
think it caused a lot of damage. It

823
00:23:06.224 --> 00:23:07.974
think it caused a lot of damage. It
was 335 days in the UK or was it

824
00:23:07.974 --> 00:23:12.932
was 335 days in the UK or was it
zero or one day? They realised it

825
00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:14.557
zero or one day? They realised it
was a big deal and they locked down

826
00:23:14.557 --> 00:23:16.640
was a big deal and they locked down
and they did that a good week before

827
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.307
and they did that a good week before
the UK and there is no doubt the UK

828
00:23:19.307 --> 00:23:21.140
the UK and there is no doubt the UK
should have done the same. The other

829
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.057
should have done the same. The other
thing and looking at Germany which

830
00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:26.849
thing and looking at Germany which
has a stellar example, they started

831
00:23:26.849 --> 00:23:28.807
has a stellar example, they started
their testing in their tracing and

832
00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.807
their testing in their tracing and
their quarantine much earlier and

833
00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:31.015
their quarantine much eartier and
that

834
00:23:31.015 --> 00:23:32.640
their quarantine much earlier and
that means that even though they

835
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.474
that means that even though they
locked down at more or less the same

836
00:23:34.474 --> 00:23:34.765
locked down at more or lass the same
time as

837
00:23:34.765 --> 00:23:36.432
locked down at more or less the same
time as the UK, they were at a

838
00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:38.390
time as the UK, they were at a
different place in their curve and

839
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.765
different place in their curve and
that basically meant that they have

840
00:23:40.765 --> 00:23:42.557
that basically meant that they have
come out of this much better than

841
00:23:42.557 --> 00:23:44.515
come out of this much better than
the UK and I am not sitting here

842
00:23:44.515 --> 00:23:45.432
the UK and I am not sitting here
criticising the government, that is

843
00:23:45.432 --> 00:23:47.265
criticising the government, that is
not why I am here but I think we

844
00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:49.474
not why I am here but I think we
have to learn from these things and

845
00:23:49.474 --> 00:23:51.849
have to learn from these things and
be completely honest but of course

846
00:23:51.849 --> 00:23:53.432
be completely honest but of course
the UK lockdown came too late and if

847
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:55.849
the UK lockdown came too late and if
the tracing had been up and running

848
00:23:55.849 --> 00:23:56.349
the tracing had been up and mnning
much before,

849
00:23:56.349 --> 00:23:57.640
the tracing had been up and running
much before, I think the country

850
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.015
much before, I think the country
could have opened much before. Also

851
00:24:01.015 --> 00:24:02.599
could have opened much before. Also
in Denmark we had a much softer

852
00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:05.849
in Denmark we had a much softer
lockdown, and now we are starting

853
00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:09.224
lockdown, and now we are starting
the tracking and tracing and

854
00:24:09.224 --> 00:24:10.640
the tracking and tracing and
quarantining as well and the next

855
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.432
quarantining as well and the next
question we have to find out is how

856
00:24:12.432 --> 00:24:14.640
question we have to find out is how
we are going to quarantine these

857
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.724
we are going to quarantine these
people. How this is actually going

858
00:24:16.724 --> 00:24:17.849
peopla. How this is actually going
to happen, a

859
00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:18.890
people. How this is actually going
to happen, a little idea from our

860
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.224
to happen, a little idea from our
own country, they are offering to

861
00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:23.807
own country, they are offering to
use some of the hotels that have no

862
00:24:23.807 --> 00:24:25.474
use some of the hotels that have no
guests to help people isolate. At

863
00:24:25.474 --> 00:24:26.057
guests to help peopla isolate. At
the

864
00:24:26.057 --> 00:24:28.224
guests to help people isolate. At
the cost of the government. They

865
00:24:28.224 --> 00:24:30.474
the cost of the government. They
could be isolated in hotels. There

866
00:24:30.474 --> 00:24:31.682
could be isolated in hotels. There
have to be

867
00:24:31.682 --> 00:24:32.265
could be isolated in hotels. There
have to he plans, pragmatic plans

868
00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:32.682
have to he plans, pragmatic plans
that ran

869
00:24:32.682 --> 00:24:34.515
have to he plans, pragmatic plans
that can be rolled out and it has to

870
00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:35.265
that ran be rolled out and it has to
be ramped up

871
00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:37.182
that can be rolled out and it has to
be ramped up pretty fast and I have

872
00:24:37.182 --> 00:24:39.057
be ramped up pretty fast and I have
no doubt, if it was ramped up

873
00:24:39.057 --> 00:24:39.599
no doubt, if it was ramped up
eartier, the

874
00:24:39.599 --> 00:24:40.557
no doubt, if it was ramped up
earlier, the UK would have been

875
00:24:40.557 --> 00:24:41.224
eartier, the UK would have been
safe. Do you

876
00:24:41.224 --> 00:24:43.432
earlier, the UK would have been
safe. Do you agree with any of that?

877
00:24:43.432 --> 00:24:46.515
safe. Do you agree with any of that?
Lockdown too late? Testing should

878
00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:47.849
Lockdown too late? Testing should
have been started earlier? It is

879
00:24:47.849 --> 00:24:49.557
have been started eartier? It is
very hard to

880
00:24:49.557 --> 00:24:50.182
have been started earlier? It is
very hard to compare countries

881
00:24:50.182 --> 00:24:51.765
very hard to compare countries
because demographics are different,

882
00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:53.224
because demographics are different,
Denmark is a relatively small

883
00:24:53.224 --> 00:24:56.640
Denmark is a relatively small
country, we have the biggest city in

884
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.599
country, we have the biggest city in
Europe, London. The UK still has the

885
00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:01.432
Europe, London. The UK still has the
highest number of excess deaths at

886
00:25:01.432 --> 00:25:03.724
highest number of excess deaths at
its peak of any country in Europe,

887
00:25:03.724 --> 00:25:04.932
its peak of any country in Europe,
according to a study from Oxford

888
00:25:04.932 --> 00:25:08.807
according to a study from Oxford
University. By any margin, we are

889
00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:11.807
University. By any margin, we are
the worst or second or third worst,

890
00:25:11.807 --> 00:25:13.182
the worst or second or third worst,
there probably are not many

891
00:25:13.182 --> 00:25:14.474
there probably are not many
countries looking at the UK saying

892
00:25:14.474 --> 00:25:18.182
countries looking at the UK saying
that is the way to do it, I would

893
00:25:18.182 --> 00:25:19.390
that is the way to do it, I would
tentatively suggest. It is difficult

894
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.265
tentatively suggest. It is difficult
to make those comparisons when you

895
00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:23.432
to make those comparisons when you
have to account for demographics,

896
00:25:23.432 --> 00:25:23.974
have to account for demographic,
age of the

897
00:25:23.974 --> 00:25:26.807
have to account for demographics,
age of the population, pre—existing

898
00:25:26.807 --> 00:25:26.890
age of the population, pre-existing
health

899
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.432
age of the population, pre—existing
health conditions, a city like

900
00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:30.682
health conditions, a city like
London, all of those things are

901
00:25:30.682 --> 00:25:32.224
London, all of those things are
different in different countries,

902
00:25:32.224 --> 00:25:33.432
different in different countries,
London is unique within Europe and

903
00:25:33.432 --> 00:25:36.974
London is unique within Europe and
Manchester as well. Helle said the

904
00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:38.640
Manchester as well. Helle said the
lockdown was too late, do you accept

905
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.515
lockdown was too late, do you accept
that? The government advisor, Sage

906
00:25:42.515 --> 00:25:44.349
that? The government advisor, Sage
gave dear

907
00:25:44.349 --> 00:25:45.390
that? The government advisor, Sage
gave clear legal, health and

908
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.849
gave clear legal, health and
scientific advice and the government

909
00:25:46.849 --> 00:25:48.057
scientific advice and the government
followed that advice. That was the

910
00:25:48.057 --> 00:25:52.390
followed that advice. That was the
right thing to do. James. Of course

911
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.432
right thing to do. james. Of course
I agree it is vital

912
00:25:53.432 --> 00:25:55.057
right thing to do. James. Of course
I agree it is vital that it rolls

913
00:25:55.057 --> 00:25:56.682
I agree it is vital that it rolls
out as soon as possible, not

914
00:25:56.682 --> 00:25:56.807
I agree it is vital that it rolls
out as soon as possible, notjust

915
00:25:56.807 --> 00:25:57.015
out as soon as possible, not just
because

916
00:25:57.015 --> 00:25:59.807
out as soon as possible, notjust
because of our safety but also

917
00:25:59.807 --> 00:26:00.849
because of our safety but also
because people need that sense of

918
00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:04.015
because people need that sense of
confidence so that they can begin

919
00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:04.849
confidence so that they ran begin
opening up

920
00:26:04.849 --> 00:26:05.682
confidence so that they can begin
opening up the economy, the most

921
00:26:05.682 --> 00:26:06.640
opening up the economy, the most
vulnerable sectors of the economy

922
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.349
vulnerable sectors of the economy
require people to be physically

923
00:26:09.349 --> 00:26:09.724
require peopla to be physically
dose

924
00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:10.807
require people to be physically
close to one another, whether that

925
00:26:10.807 --> 00:26:12.765
dose to one another, whether that
is

926
00:26:12.765 --> 00:26:14.599
close to one another, whether that
is restaurants, bars, arts and

927
00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:17.182
is restaurants, bars, arts and
entertainment, there will be a huge

928
00:26:17.182 --> 00:26:19.765
entertainment, there will be a huge
benefit to a test that can give an

929
00:26:19.765 --> 00:26:20.390
benefit to a test that ran give an
answer in

930
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.932
benefit to a test that can give an
answer in 20 minutes for the likes

931
00:26:21.932 --> 00:26:22.932
answer in 20 minutes for the likes
of film and television production,

932
00:26:22.932 --> 00:26:23.557
of film and telavision production,
it is not

933
00:26:23.557 --> 00:26:24.432
of film and television production,
it is not the most important thing

934
00:26:24.432 --> 00:26:26.224
it is not the most important thing
in the world, but it is a vital

935
00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:28.224
in the world, but it is a vital
sector and it has got lots of people

936
00:26:28.224 --> 00:26:28.807
sector and it has got lots of peopla
through the

937
00:26:28.807 --> 00:26:29.724
sector and it has got lots of people
through the lockdown and people are

938
00:26:29.724 --> 00:26:30.349
through the lockdown and peopla are
going to start

939
00:26:30.349 --> 00:26:32.182
through the lockdown and people are
going to start to see the autumn

940
00:26:32.182 --> 00:26:34.599
going to start to see the autumn
schedules clearing themselves of

941
00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:35.557
schedules clearing themselves of
British dramas. That would be

942
00:26:35.557 --> 00:26:37.224
British dramas. That would be
incredible to have confidence that

943
00:26:37.224 --> 00:26:39.849
incredible to have confidence that
you could get actors and crew on a

944
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:42.349
you could get actors and crew on a
set, actors need to kiss, hug,

945
00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:45.182
set, actors need to kiss, hug,
fight, unless you want terrible

946
00:26:45.182 --> 00:26:46.224
fight, unless you want terrible
dramas, so this stuff doesn’t

947
00:26:46.224 --> 00:26:49.807
dramas, so this stuff doesn’t
matter, it is not the priority, but

948
00:26:49.807 --> 00:26:50.932
matter, it is not the priority, but
I think confidence that people can

949
00:26:50.932 --> 00:26:52.349
I think confidence that peopla ran
work

950
00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:52.599
I think confidence that people ran
work safely

951
00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:55.974
I think confidence that people can
work safely and that tourists and

952
00:26:55.974 --> 00:26:56.515
work safely and that tourists and
peopla are

953
00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:57.890
work safely and that tourists and
people are returning to city and

954
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.099
peopla are returning to city and
town

955
00:26:58.099 --> 00:26:59.307
people are returning to city and
town centres can eat and drink and

956
00:26:59.307 --> 00:26:59.724
town centres ran eat and drink and
reinvest in

957
00:26:59.724 --> 00:27:00.765
town centres can eat and drink and
reinvest in the economy and that is

958
00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:04.974
reinvest in the economy and that is
vital. It should be pointed out that

959
00:27:04.974 --> 00:27:06.390
vital. It should be pointed out that
the lockdown did come in time for

960
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.015
the lockdown did come in time for
the peak. So,

961
00:27:08.015 --> 00:27:09.015
the lockdown did come in time for
the peak. 50, there is an argument

962
00:27:09.015 --> 00:27:10.307
the peak. So, there is an argument
to say that if we

963
00:27:10.307 --> 00:27:10.807
the peak. 50, there is an argument
to say that if we had locked down

964
00:27:10.807 --> 00:27:11.182
to say that if we had locked down
eartier

965
00:27:11.182 --> 00:27:12.849
to say that if we had locked down
earlier whether people would have

966
00:27:12.849 --> 00:27:13.015
eartier whether peopla would have
been

967
00:27:13.015 --> 00:27:13.724
earlier whether people would have
been psychologically ready and

968
00:27:13.724 --> 00:27:15.640
been psychologically ready and
obeyed it and if you see the

969
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.015
obeyed it and if you see the
lockdown coming in on March the

970
00:27:18.015 --> 00:27:19.474
lockdown coming in on March the
23rd, it was about ten days later

971
00:27:19.474 --> 00:27:22.349
23rd, it was about ten days later
that you see that spike. The peak

972
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:25.724
that you see that spike. The peak
follows the lockdown. Of course it

973
00:27:25.724 --> 00:27:28.557
follows the lockdown. Of course it
does. The peak does follow the

974
00:27:28.557 --> 00:27:29.807
does. The peak does follow the
lockdown but there was an argument

975
00:27:29.807 --> 00:27:32.640
lockdown but there was an argument
at the time that it was only the

976
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.807
at the time that it was only the
week before and rightly or wrongly,

977
00:27:34.807 --> 00:27:37.015
week before and rightly or wrongly,
and decisions will now be made about

978
00:27:37.015 --> 00:27:39.599
and decisions will now be made about
future events, but only the week

979
00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:40.682
future events, but only the week
before there were thousands at

980
00:27:40.682 --> 00:27:43.349
before there were thousands at
Cheltenham. Every step of the way

981
00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:45.015
Cheltenham. Every step of the way
the government has had to look at

982
00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:46.682
the government has had to look at
the psychology of the public on it

983
00:27:46.682 --> 00:27:50.057
the psychology of the public on it
and I spoke to a Tory MP this week

984
00:27:50.057 --> 00:27:52.057
and I spoke to a Tory MP this week
who likened the confusion over

985
00:27:52.057 --> 00:27:53.224
who likened the confusion over
timing and everything seeming back

986
00:27:53.224 --> 00:27:55.432
timing and everything seeming back
to front two that Morecambe and

987
00:27:55.432 --> 00:27:55.640
to front two that Morerambe and
white

988
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.807
to front two that Morecambe and
white sketch with Andre Previn where

989
00:27:56.807 --> 00:27:58.599
white sketch with Andre Previn where
he says, you’re not playing all of

990
00:27:58.599 --> 00:27:59.932
he says, you’re not playing all of
the right notes and Eric Morecambe

991
00:27:59.932 --> 00:28:01.057
the right notes and Eric Morerambe
5575

992
00:28:01.057 --> 00:28:01.682
the right notes and Eric Morerambe
says I am, but

993
00:28:01.682 --> 00:28:02.515
the right notes and Eric Morecambe
says I am, butjust not necessarily

994
00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:03.224
says I am, but just not necessarily
in the right

995
00:28:03.224 --> 00:28:04.890
says I am, butjust not necessarily
in the right order and I think from

996
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.599
in the right order and I think from
the public perspective is they have

997
00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:09.765
the public perspective is they have
asked themselves why are you doing

998
00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:10.932
asked themselves why are you doing
this now, the quarantine thing, lots

999
00:28:10.932 --> 00:28:14.057
this now, the quarantine thing, lots
of peopla are

1000
00:28:14.057 --> 00:28:14.682
this now, the quarantine thing, lots
of people are saying, you are

1001
00:28:14.682 --> 00:28:16.140
of people are saying, you are
quarantining flights now... Not yet

1002
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.849
quarantining ﬂights now... Not yet
but they are

1003
00:28:16.849 --> 00:28:18.724
quarantining flights now... Not yet
but they are talking about it. Why

1004
00:28:18.724 --> 00:28:19.432
but they are talking about it. why
didn’t you do

1005
00:28:19.432 --> 00:28:20.224
but they are talking about it. Why
didn’t you do them at the beginning

1006
00:28:20.224 --> 00:28:24.015
didn’t you do them at the beginning
of the crisis? The messaging around

1007
00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:25.849
of the crisis? The messaging around
the Prime Minister addressing the

1008
00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:26.182
the Prime Minister addressing the
pub“:

1009
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.974
the Prime Minister addressing the
public about the loosening of the

1010
00:28:27.974 --> 00:28:29.224
public about the loosening of the
restrictions before actually

1011
00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:29.974
restrictions before actually
releasing the paperwork describing

1012
00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:32.057
releasing the paperwork describing
how people should go back to work it

1013
00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:35.224
how people should go back to work it
seemed to be the wrong way around.

1014
00:28:35.224 --> 00:28:36.599
seemed to be the wrong way around.
The test, track and trace, it is

1015
00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.807
The test, track and trace, it is
great that we have this technology

1016
00:28:37.807 --> 00:28:41.765
great that we have this technology
but that did add that defy three

1017
00:28:41.765 --> 00:28:43.682
but that did add that defy three
years ago the problems that would be

1018
00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:45.349
years ago the problems that would be
faced by this country in the event

1019
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.682
faced by this country in the event
of a global pandemic and people are

1020
00:28:47.682 --> 00:28:48.432
of a global pandemic and peopla are
asking

1021
00:28:48.432 --> 00:28:49.890
of a global pandemic and people are
asking themselves why has the timing

1022
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.849
asking themselves why has the timing
come so late? Why is it that

1023
00:28:51.849 --> 00:28:53.224
come so late? Why is it that
countries like South Korea were on

1024
00:28:53.224 --> 00:28:54.849
countries like South Korea were on
top of this at the beginning of the

1025
00:28:54.849 --> 00:28:57.307
top of this at the beginning of the
pandemic hitting their nation,

1026
00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:58.849
pandemic hitting their nation,
whereas we only seem to be getting

1027
00:28:58.849 --> 00:29:00.474
whereas we only seem to be getting
to grips with some of that

1028
00:29:00.474 --> 00:29:02.682
to grips with some of that
technological response at the end of

1029
00:29:02.682 --> 00:29:04.682
technological response at the end of
it? One of the reasons why

1030
00:29:04.682 --> 00:29:06.515
it? One of the reasons why
quarantine will come in at the end

1031
00:29:06.515 --> 00:29:08.682
quarantine will come in at the end
of the pandemic rather than the

1032
00:29:08.682 --> 00:29:10.057
of the pandemic rather than the
middle is because when the number of

1033
00:29:10.057 --> 00:29:10.474
middle is because when the number of
rases in

1034
00:29:10.474 --> 00:29:11.807
middle is because when the number of
cases in circulation in the

1035
00:29:11.807 --> 00:29:13.807
cases in circulation in the
population are so much larger than

1036
00:29:13.807 --> 00:29:15.849
population are so much larger than
those being brought in by air

1037
00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:18.182
those being brought in by air
passengers, there is no point in

1038
00:29:18.182 --> 00:29:18.974
passengers, there is no point in
having a quarantine, they

1039
00:29:18.974 --> 00:29:21.932
having a quarantine, they
represented less than 0.5% of the

1040
00:29:21.932 --> 00:29:23.682
represented less than 0.5% of the
caseload. Now that the caseload is

1041
00:29:23.682 --> 00:29:25.349
caseload. Now that the caseload is
going down domestically and there is

1042
00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:27.390
going down domestically and there is
prospect that air travel will go up,

1043
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.807
prospect that air travel will go up,
it becomes relatively more important

1044
00:29:28.807 --> 00:29:31.599
it becomes relatively more important
and it measures like quarantine

1045
00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:32.807
and it measures like quarantine
become significant. There were so

1046
00:29:32.807 --> 00:29:34.099
become significant. There were so
many things that people said would

1047
00:29:34.099 --> 00:29:35.849
many things that peopla said would
go wrong

1048
00:29:35.849 --> 00:29:36.974
many things that people said would
go wrong that have been handled very

1049
00:29:36.974 --> 00:29:39.099
go wrong that have been handled very
well. About eight weeks ago, people

1050
00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:41.307
well. About eight weeks ago, people
said we would run out of ventilators

1051
00:29:41.307 --> 00:29:42.015
said we would mn out of ventilators
and now

1052
00:29:42.015 --> 00:29:43.307
said we would run out of ventilators
and now we have 13000 and never more

1053
00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:45.307
and now we have 13000 and never more
than half of them have been in use.

1054
00:29:45.307 --> 00:29:47.432
than half of them have been in use.
People said we might run out of

1055
00:29:47.432 --> 00:29:49.682
People said we might run out of
intensive care beds, we have nearly

1056
00:29:49.682 --> 00:29:49.849
intensive rare beds, we have nearty
doubled

1057
00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:51.099
intensive care beds, we have nearly
doubled the number of beds at no

1058
00:29:51.099 --> 00:29:53.307
doubled the number of beds at no
more than half of those have ever

1059
00:29:53.307 --> 00:29:54.807
more than half of those have ever
been in use by coronavirus patients.

1060
00:29:54.807 --> 00:29:56.849
been in use by coronavirus patients.
All of those aspects of the

1061
00:29:56.849 --> 00:29:58.807
All of those aspects of the
response, which include the

1062
00:29:58.807 --> 00:29:59.974
response, which include the
relationship to the timing, have

1063
00:29:59.974 --> 00:30:03.349
relationship to the timing, have
worked in this country very well and

1064
00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:05.015
worked in this country very well and
I think we can all collectively take

1065
00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:05.640
I think we ran all collactively take
some pride in

1066
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.682
I think we can all collectively take
some pride in the way that as a

1067
00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:07.807
some pride in the way that as a
nation we have come together, we

1068
00:30:07.807 --> 00:30:09.349
nation we have come together, we
have worked together on the

1069
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:12.099
have worked together on the
lockdown, it has been difficult,

1070
00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:12.807
lockdown, it has been difficult,
difficult for families,

1071
00:30:12.807 --> 00:30:12.974
lockdown, it has been difficult,
difficult forfamilies, children,

1072
00:30:12.974 --> 00:30:13.724
difficult for families, children,
peopla at

1073
00:30:13.724 --> 00:30:14.724
difficult forfamilies, children,
people at work, the art sector,

1074
00:30:14.724 --> 00:30:15.099
peopla at work, the art sector,
older peopla,

1075
00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:16.015
people at work, the art sector,
older people, tough for all of us

1076
00:30:16.015 --> 00:30:16.640
older peopla, tough for all of us
but we

1077
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.682
older people, tough for all of us
but we have worked together, we have

1078
00:30:18.682 --> 00:30:19.724
but we have worked together, we have
been disciplined and thankfully now

1079
00:30:19.724 --> 00:30:21.224
been disciplined and thankfuuy now
we are

1080
00:30:21.224 --> 00:30:22.640
been disciplined and thankfully now
we are moving into a slightly

1081
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.890
we are moving into a slightly
happier days ahead and I think we

1082
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:25.265
happier days ahead and I think we
ran take

1083
00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:25.807
happier days ahead and I think we
can take collective national pride

1084
00:30:25.807 --> 00:30:26.432
ran take collactive national pride
in the way

1085
00:30:26.432 --> 00:30:27.182
can take collective national pride
in the way we have worked together

1086
00:30:27.182 --> 00:30:28.057
in the way we have worked together
on that.

1087
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.515
I’v
e

1088
00:30:34.515 --> 00:30:37.890
I’ve tried to give the government
the benefit of the doubt and I

1089
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.724
the benefit of the doubt and I
understand how difficult the

1090
00:30:38.724 --> 00:30:39.890
understand how difficult the
challenge is that they are dealing

1091
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.557
challenge is that they are dealing
with, and I have a lot of sympathy

1092
00:30:41.557 --> 00:30:46.474
with, and I have a lot of sympathy
with that, but they seem to me to be

1093
00:30:46.474 --> 00:30:47.182
with that, but they seem to me to be
repeating the same mistakes

1094
00:30:47.182 --> 00:30:50.724
repeating the same mistakes
throughout this. Is that sometimes

1095
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.140
throughout this. Is that sometimes
the rhetoric is running ahead of the

1096
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.349
the rhetoric is mnning ahead of the
reality. We saw

1097
00:30:54.349 --> 00:30:55.182
the rhetoric is running ahead of the
reality. We saw that on testing, we

1098
00:30:55.182 --> 00:30:57.432
reality. We saw that on testing, we
saw it on PPE and I think we are now

1099
00:30:57.432 --> 00:30:59.099
saw it on PPE and I think we are now
seeing it again with this. From what

1100
00:30:59.099 --> 00:31:01.224
seeing it again with this. From what
I know in Greater Manchester, there

1101
00:31:01.224 --> 00:31:02.515
I know in Greater Manchester, there
will not be a world beating

1102
00:31:02.515 --> 00:31:02.724
I know in Greater Manchester, there
will not be a world heating system

1103
00:31:02.724 --> 00:31:04.724
will not be a world heating system
in place by the lst of

1104
00:31:04.724 --> 00:31:04.890
will not be a world heating system
in place by the lst ofJune,

1105
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.432
will not be a world heating system
in place by the 1st ofJune, as the

1106
00:31:05.432 --> 00:31:05.640
in place by the 1st of june, as the
Prime

1107
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.390
in place by the 1st ofJune, as the
Prime Minister seems to suggest

1108
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.515
Prime Minister seems to suggest
yesterday. Chris is saying it will

1109
00:31:09.515 --> 00:31:13.599
yesterday. Chris is saying it will
be, so what makes you say that? They

1110
00:31:13.599 --> 00:31:14.849
be, so what makes you say that? They
just appointed the chief executive

1111
00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:17.807
just appointed the chief executive
of Leeds about two weeks ago to try

1112
00:31:17.807 --> 00:31:21.515
of Leeds about two weeks ago to try
and integrate the local system with

1113
00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:21.724
and integrate the [oral system with
the

1114
00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:23.349
and integrate the local system with
the national system, and he is

1115
00:31:23.349 --> 00:31:24.599
the national system, and he is
working through that at the moment

1116
00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:26.890
working through that at the moment
and it’s complicated. For what I

1117
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.265
and it’s complicated. For what I
know, it will be beginning by then

1118
00:31:28.265 --> 00:31:30.349
know, it will be beginning by then
but it will nowhere near be in

1119
00:31:30.349 --> 00:31:30.974
but it will nowhere near be in
place, and I

1120
00:31:30.974 --> 00:31:31.765
but it will nowhere near be in
place, and Ifeel that that 1st

1121
00:31:31.765 --> 00:31:32.724
but it will nowhere near be in
place, and I feel that that 1st of

1122
00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:33.432
place, and I feel that that 1st of
june date is

1123
00:31:33.432 --> 00:31:34.307
place, and I feel that that 1st of
June date is going back to that

1124
00:31:34.307 --> 00:31:36.890
June date is going back to that
conversation we were saying about

1125
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.724
conversation we were saying about
schools, and really schools should

1126
00:31:38.724 --> 00:31:39.890
schools, and really schools should
only be opening when this is

1127
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:40.057
only be opening when this is
properly

1128
00:31:40.057 --> 00:31:40.307
only be opening when this is
property in

1129
00:31:40.307 --> 00:31:42.640
only be opening when this is
properly in place. The second

1130
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.849
properly in place. The second
mistake touches on this as well.

1131
00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:47.515
mistake touches on this as well.
There is a lot of local expertise on

1132
00:31:47.515 --> 00:31:49.474
There is a lot of [oral expertise on
these issues,

1133
00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.057
There is a lot of local expertise on
these issues, but throughout this

1134
00:31:50.057 --> 00:31:50.807
these issues, but throughout this
the government has almost

1135
00:31:50.807 --> 00:31:52.390
the government has almost
disregarded that and kind of rushed

1136
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.974
disregarded that and kind of mshed
to stand

1137
00:31:55.974 --> 00:31:58.265
disregarded that and kind of rushed
to stand on its own national systems

1138
00:31:58.265 --> 00:31:59.224
to stand on its own national systems
and sign contracts with private

1139
00:31:59.224 --> 00:32:00.349
and sign contracts with private
entities and trying to build

1140
00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:01.515
entities and trying to build
something from scratch, and I think

1141
00:32:01.515 --> 00:32:03.474
something from scratch, and I think
we’ve seen that here and we have

1142
00:32:03.474 --> 00:32:04.890
we’ve seen that here and we have
some doubts about the quality of the

1143
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.474
some doubts about the quality of the
training provided. They really

1144
00:32:07.474 --> 00:32:10.099
training provided. They really
should have used the local expertise

1145
00:32:10.099 --> 00:32:10.474
should have used the [oral expertise
first and

1146
00:32:10.474 --> 00:32:11.515
should have used the local expertise
first and build from there, and I

1147
00:32:11.515 --> 00:32:13.390
first and build from there, and I
just feel that the government is

1148
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.140
just feel that the government is
making problems for itself by not

1149
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:16.265
making problams for itself by not
learning

1150
00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:18.057
making problems for itself by not
learning from some of those earlier

1151
00:32:18.057 --> 00:32:19.057
learning from some of those eartier
mistakes,

1152
00:32:19.057 --> 00:32:20.349
learning from some of those earlier
mistakes, and going on a different

1153
00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:21.682
mistakes, and going on a different
path. I

1154
00:32:21.682 --> 00:32:21.849
mistakes, and going on a different
path. Ithink

1155
00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:22.724
mistakes, and going on a different
path. I think we are getting there,

1156
00:32:22.724 --> 00:32:24.599
path. I think we are getting there,
that’s how I would describe it, but

1157
00:32:24.599 --> 00:32:25.765
that’s how I would describe it, but
I think the government should be

1158
00:32:25.765 --> 00:32:28.974
I think the government should be
honest with people. It will be mid

1159
00:32:28.974 --> 00:32:29.640
honest with peopla. It will be mid
or late june

1160
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:29.849
honest with people. It will be mid
or late June before

1161
00:32:29.849 --> 00:32:30.640
honest with people. It will be mid
or lateJune before the system is up

1162
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.557
or late june before the system is up
and mnning.

1163
00:32:32.557 --> 00:32:35.224
or lateJune before the system is up
and running. Alfie, are you

1164
00:32:35.224 --> 00:32:37.099
and running. Alfie, are you
confident that test, track and trace

1165
00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:38.724
confident that test, track and trace
will be fully embedded by the 1st of

1166
00:32:38.724 --> 00:32:39.057
will be fully embedded by the 1st of
june? what

1167
00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:42.849
will be fully embedded by the 1st of
June? What prompted your question?

1168
00:32:42.849 --> 00:32:44.057
june? what prompted your question?
I’m a computer

1169
00:32:44.057 --> 00:32:45.057
June? What prompted your question?
I’m a computer science student and

1170
00:32:45.057 --> 00:32:45.849
I’m a computer science student and
my experience of software

1171
00:32:45.849 --> 00:32:47.515
my experience of software
engineering is that things do go

1172
00:32:47.515 --> 00:32:49.057
engineering is that things do go
wrong, they often go wrong, and we

1173
00:32:49.057 --> 00:32:50.307
wrong, they often go wrong, and we
are mnning out

1174
00:32:50.307 --> 00:32:51.265
wrong, they often go wrong, and we
are running out of time. If you want

1175
00:32:51.265 --> 00:32:52.099
are mnning out of time. If you want
to launch an app

1176
00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:52.932
are running out of time. If you want
to launch an app on the same day

1177
00:32:52.932 --> 00:32:54.974
to launch an app on the same day
that schools open, you are asking

1178
00:32:54.974 --> 00:32:59.265
that schools open, you are asking
for the worst. It sounds like we are

1179
00:32:59.265 --> 00:33:01.099
for the worst. It sounds like we are
probably not going to get the app on

1180
00:33:01.099 --> 00:33:01.849
probably not going to get the app on
the 1st of june

1181
00:33:01.849 --> 00:33:03.515
probably not going to get the app on
the 1st ofJune I am wondering if

1182
00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:04.015
the 1st of june I am wondering if
it’s a question

1183
00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.140
the 1st ofJune I am wondering if
it’s a question of interpretation,

1184
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.807
it’s a question of interpretation,
because you have got Alfie saying,

1185
00:33:07.807 --> 00:33:10.307
because you have got Alfie saying,
when will test, track and trace be

1186
00:33:10.307 --> 00:33:12.515
when will test, track and trace be
fully embedded, and you say

1187
00:33:12.515 --> 00:33:13.307
fully embedded, and you say
absolutely on June the

1188
00:33:13.307 --> 00:33:13.807
fully embedded, and you say
absolutely onJune the 1st, and Andy

1189
00:33:13.807 --> 00:33:14.974
absolutely on june the 1st, and Andy
saying it will be

1190
00:33:14.974 --> 00:33:15.640
absolutely onJune the lst, and Andy
saying it will be getting go but

1191
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.224
saying it will be getting go but
fully embedded, up and running, all

1192
00:33:17.224 --> 00:33:19.932
fully embedded, up and running, all
bells and whistles, no. Which is it,

1193
00:33:19.932 --> 00:33:23.932
bells and whisﬂas, no. which is it,
in your view?

1194
00:33:23.932 --> 00:33:24.807
bells and whistles, no. Which is it,
in your view? The 25,000 people

1195
00:33:24.807 --> 00:33:26.557
in your view? The 25,000 people
needed to operate the system and

1196
00:33:26.557 --> 00:33:28.515
needed to operate the system and
deliver 10,000 track and traces per

1197
00:33:28.515 --> 00:33:31.099
deliver 10,000 track and traces per
day will be in place by the lst of

1198
00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:31.432
day will be in place by the 1st of
june. 24,000

1199
00:33:31.432 --> 00:33:32.265
day will be in place by the lst of
June. 2A,000 of them have been

1200
00:33:32.265 --> 00:33:34.390
june. 24,000 of them have been
recruited

1201
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:35.224
June. 2A,000 of them have been
recruited already and are in

1202
00:33:35.224 --> 00:33:37.307
recruited already and are in
advanced stages of training, so it

1203
00:33:37.307 --> 00:33:38.849
advanced stages of training, so it
will be ready to deploy on the 1st

1204
00:33:38.849 --> 00:33:39.849
will be ready to deploy on the 1st
of june. The

1205
00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:41.099
will be ready to deploy on the lst
ofJune. The app will be a few weeks

1206
00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:41.849
of june. The app will be a few weeks
after that,

1207
00:33:41.849 --> 00:33:42.474
ofJune. The app will be a few weeks
after that, which will further

1208
00:33:42.474 --> 00:33:45.640
after that, which will further
augment the system and we will learn

1209
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.224
augment the system and we will learn
a lot more about coronavirus by

1210
00:33:47.224 --> 00:33:49.140
a lot more about coronavirus by
using it, but we will be ready to go

1211
00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.015
using it, but we will be ready to go
on the 1st of

1212
00:33:50.015 --> 00:33:51.057
using it, but we will be ready to go
on the 1st ofJune, and it

1213
00:33:51.057 --> 00:33:51.265
using it, but we will be ready to go
on the lst ofJune, and it will

1214
00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:51.474
on the 1st of june, and it will
really

1215
00:33:51.474 --> 00:33:51.640
on the lst of june, and it will
really help

1216
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.390
on the lst ofJune, and it will
really help us understand how the

1217
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.182
really help us understand how the
disease spreads it will help us

1218
00:33:55.182 --> 00:33:56.265
disease spreads it will help us
control it, identify people in

1219
00:33:56.265 --> 00:33:56.682
control it, identify peopla in
danger of

1220
00:33:56.682 --> 00:33:58.849
control it, identify people in
danger of catching it, get them

1221
00:33:58.849 --> 00:33:59.765
danger of catching it, get them
quarantined and tested really

1222
00:33:59.765 --> 00:34:05.224
quarantined and tested really
quickly. Is it brings us back to the

1223
00:34:05.224 --> 00:34:09.390
quickly. Is it brings us back to the
first question with schools, because

1224
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:13.724
first question with schools, because
you had a member of Sage, the body

1225
00:34:13.724 --> 00:34:14.640
you had a member of Sage, the body
that advises the government, saying

1226
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.682
that advises the government, saying
a well—functioning track and trace

1227
00:34:16.682 --> 00:34:17.099
a well-functioning track and trace
system

1228
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.682
a well—functioning track and trace
system needs to be embedded and

1229
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:19.724
system needs to be embedded and
working well before schools can

1230
00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:23.099
working well before schools ran
reopen.

1231
00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:24.224
working well before schools can
reopen. Camilla, you are really keen

1232
00:34:24.224 --> 00:34:26.224
reopen. Camilla, you are really keen
for your kids to go back to school.

1233
00:34:26.224 --> 00:34:27.682
for your kids to go back to school.
The system will start on

1234
00:34:27.682 --> 00:34:28.099
for your kids to go back to school.
The system will start onJune the

1235
00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:28.599
The system will start on june the
1st, track

1236
00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.599
The system will start onJune the
1st, track and trace. We will see,

1237
00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:33.515
1st, track and trace. We will see,
and you are confident that it

1238
00:34:33.515 --> 00:34:33.765
lst, track and trace. We will see,
and you are confident that it will

1239
00:34:33.765 --> 00:34:35.807
and you are confident that it will
be all systems go from the get go.

1240
00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:39.099
be all systems go from the get go.
Do you have any concerns about it?

1241
00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:40.557
Do you have any concerns about it?
From the perspective of all of the

1242
00:34:40.557 --> 00:34:42.849
From the perspective of all of the
evidence pointing to children not

1243
00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:45.015
evidence pointing to children not
being badly affected if they do

1244
00:34:45.015 --> 00:34:46.682
being badly affected if they do
catch it and not seemingly being as

1245
00:34:46.682 --> 00:34:48.849
catch it and not seemingly being as
infectious as adults, and

1246
00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:50.099
infectious as adults, and
considering all of the measures that

1247
00:34:50.099 --> 00:34:52.807
considering all of the measures that
schools have been putting in place

1248
00:34:52.807 --> 00:34:55.849
schools have been putting in place
to make sure that children are safe,

1249
00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:57.265
to make sure that children are safe,
and considering the fact that they

1250
00:34:57.265 --> 00:35:00.057
and considering the fact that they
are missing out on so much of their

1251
00:35:00.057 --> 00:35:01.515
are missing out on so much of their
education by being at home, all of

1252
00:35:01.515 --> 00:35:04.724
education by being at home, all of
this is about assessing risk and

1253
00:35:04.724 --> 00:35:06.474
this is about assessing risk and
weighing up the different

1254
00:35:06.474 --> 00:35:08.807
weighing up the different
probabilities, and I think, on a

1255
00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:08.932
probabilities, and Ithink, on a
balance

1256
00:35:08.932 --> 00:35:09.599
probabilities, and I think, on a
balance of probabilities, overall,

1257
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:11.224
balance of probabilities, overall,
after two months at home with us

1258
00:35:11.224 --> 00:35:13.182
after two months at home with us
trying to home educate them as well

1259
00:35:13.182 --> 00:35:13.849
trying to home educate them as well
as we ran

1260
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:15.307
trying to home educate them as well
as we can while also working, I

1261
00:35:15.307 --> 00:35:16.849
as we ran whila also working, I
think that,

1262
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:17.724
as we can while also working, I
think that, on balance, my children

1263
00:35:17.724 --> 00:35:20.640
think that, on balance, my children
are better off in school, yes. Let’s

1264
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.640
are better off in school, yes. Let’s
take another question, from Gerald

1265
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.599
take another question, from Gerald
Armin.

1266
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.765
Theatres were the first
to close and will probably

1267
00:35:29.765 --> 00:35:32.140
be the last to reopen,
which could be many months.

1268
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.557
For many small independent theatres
that don’t have deep pockets,

1269
00:35:34.557 --> 00:35:39.557
it could be the end.

1270
00:35:40.057 --> 00:35:40.307
m

1271
00:35:40.307 --> 00:35:41.474
Do you think the government should
hail

1272
00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:48.474
Do you think the government should
bail us out? I think it’s worth

1273
00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:49.515
bail us out? I think it’s worth
acknowledging upfront that, of

1274
00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:49.682
acknowladging upfront that, of
course,

1275
00:35:49.682 --> 00:35:50.640
acknowledging upfront that, of
course, against a backdrop of huge

1276
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.057
course, against a backdrop of huge
strain on the NHS and the work of

1277
00:35:54.057 --> 00:35:55.682
strain on the NHS and the work of
carers and these big questions we

1278
00:35:55.682 --> 00:35:57.057
carers and these big questions we
are asking about when kids should go

1279
00:35:57.057 --> 00:35:59.849
are asking about when kids should go
back to school, they will always

1280
00:35:59.849 --> 00:36:01.515
back to school, they will always
remain the primary focus, and that’s

1281
00:36:01.515 --> 00:36:03.515
remain the primary focus, and that’s
right, but it’s also right that, as

1282
00:36:03.515 --> 00:36:04.890
right, but it’s also right that, as
the country starts to get back on

1283
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.057
the country starts to get back on
its feet, certain industries and

1284
00:36:07.057 --> 00:36:10.515
its feet, certain industries and
companies are going to have them

1285
00:36:10.515 --> 00:36:13.640
companies are going to have them
which can contribute as profitable

1286
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.474
which ran contribute as profitable
industries,

1287
00:36:14.474 --> 00:36:14.890
which can contribute as profitable
industries, can contribute

1288
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.307
industries, can contribute
substantially to the revitalising

1289
00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.307
substantially to the revitalising
and reopening of Britain, it’s

1290
00:36:17.307 --> 00:36:19.474
and reopening of Britain, it’s
incumbent on us to have these

1291
00:36:19.474 --> 00:36:20.057
incumbent on us to have these
difficult conversations with

1292
00:36:20.057 --> 00:36:24.557
difficult conversations with
government whereby we need to tell

1293
00:36:24.557 --> 00:36:25.682
government whereby we need to tell
them the specific challenges we are

1294
00:36:25.682 --> 00:36:27.682
them the specific challenges we are
going to have in order to play that

1295
00:36:27.682 --> 00:36:28.640
going to have in order to play that
active role in reactivating the

1296
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.224
active role in reactivating the
economy of the you have the

1297
00:36:31.224 --> 00:36:32.724
economy of the you have the
government here in the form of

1298
00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.765
government here in the form of
Chris, the one—man government. Do

1299
00:36:34.765 --> 00:36:36.474
Chris, the one-man government. Do
you want more

1300
00:36:36.474 --> 00:36:39.557
Chris, the one—man government. Do
you want more bailouts? The

1301
00:36:39.557 --> 00:36:41.307
you want more bailouts? The
government has provided all sorts of

1302
00:36:41.307 --> 00:36:42.724
government has provided all sorts of
money in terms of coronavirus

1303
00:36:42.724 --> 00:36:42.890
money in terms of coronavims
interruption

1304
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:43.765
money in terms of coronavirus
interruption loans for business and

1305
00:36:43.765 --> 00:36:45.099
interruption loans for business and
that kind of thing. Is there a

1306
00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:47.015
that kind of thing. Is there a
separate bailout you would request

1307
00:36:47.015 --> 00:36:50.307
separate bailout you would request
from the government for theatres?

1308
00:36:50.307 --> 00:36:51.224
from the government for theatres?
The job

1309
00:36:51.224 --> 00:36:51.474
from the government for theatres?
Thejob retention

1310
00:36:51.474 --> 00:36:51.974
from the government for theatres?
The job retention scheme was a

1311
00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:53.474
The job retention scheme was a
life—saver for so many in

1312
00:36:53.474 --> 00:36:53.682
The job retention scheme was a
life—saverfor so many in my

1313
00:36:53.682 --> 00:36:53.974
life-saver for so many in my
industry, the

1314
00:36:53.974 --> 00:36:56.015
life—saverfor so many in my
industry, the majority of whom are

1315
00:36:56.015 --> 00:36:57.682
industry, the majority of whom are
freelancers. It wasn’t perfect and

1316
00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:58.890
freelancers. It wasn’t perfect and
didn’t catch everybody, and I think

1317
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.599
didn’t catch everybody, and I think
we need to look at, but

1318
00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:04.057
we need to look at, but
unfortunately, because joyfully the

1319
00:37:04.057 --> 00:37:06.640
unfortunately, because joyfully the
next few months, according to your

1320
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.474
next few months, according to your
plan, pubs and restaurants and

1321
00:37:08.474 --> 00:37:09.515
plan, pubs and restaurants and
manufacturers and retailers start to

1322
00:37:09.515 --> 00:37:09.890
manufacturers and retailars start to
be able

1323
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.682
manufacturers and retailers start to
be able to slowly reopen, but

1324
00:37:11.682 --> 00:37:13.724
be able to slowly reopen, but
unfortunately that will not be the

1325
00:37:13.724 --> 00:37:14.057
unfortunately that will not be the
use

1326
00:37:14.057 --> 00:37:15.890
unfortunately that will not be the
case with theatres and performing

1327
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:16.015
use with theatres and performing
arts

1328
00:37:16.015 --> 00:37:17.307
case with theatres and performing
arts venues. We have tried our best

1329
00:37:17.307 --> 00:37:19.807
arts venues. We have tried our best
but it’s now apparent there was no

1330
00:37:19.807 --> 00:37:22.224
but it’s now apparent there was no
real viable social distancing model

1331
00:37:22.224 --> 00:37:22.599
real viabla social distancing model
to get

1332
00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:26.265
real viable social distancing model
to get audiences safely. It has to

1333
00:37:26.265 --> 00:37:28.474
to get audiences safely. It has to
be safe for them to go back to

1334
00:37:28.474 --> 00:37:29.474
be safe for them to go back to
theatres to watch plays and

1335
00:37:29.474 --> 00:37:31.849
theatres to watch plays and
musicals. You’d have to be 20% for

1336
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:32.432
musicals. You’d have to be 2096 for
them and they

1337
00:37:32.432 --> 00:37:34.515
musicals. You’d have to be 20% for
them and they need be about 80% full

1338
00:37:34.515 --> 00:37:34.849
them and they need be about 8096 full
in order

1339
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:35.474
them and they need be about 80% full
in order to sustain themselves

1340
00:37:35.474 --> 00:37:38.890
in order to sustain themselves
economically. So that’s just a

1341
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.099
economically. So that’s just a
problam,

1342
00:37:39.099 --> 00:37:39.890
economically. So that’s just a
problem, because the culture sectors

1343
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.474
problem, because the culture sectors
are so profitable. It’s not like

1344
00:37:42.474 --> 00:37:45.265
are so profitable. It’s not like
this is the 19705 and we are bailing

1345
00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:46.265
this is the 19705 and we are bailing
out industries that are not

1346
00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:47.849
out industries that are not
profitable. I think the figure is

1347
00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:49.849
profitable. I think the figure is
about, for every £1 you invest in

1348
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:51.474
about, for every £1 you invest in
the arts, you get about £5 back, so

1349
00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:53.057
the arts, you get about is back, so
we can’t

1350
00:37:53.057 --> 00:37:54.349
the arts, you get about £5 back, so
we can’t wait to be back and doing

1351
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:57.390
we can’t wait to be back and doing
that for you, and it’s not the case

1352
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.640
that for you, and it’s not the use
that it’s an

1353
00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.015
that for you, and it’s not the case
that it’s an equivalence whereby

1354
00:37:59.015 --> 00:38:01.432
that it’s an equivalence whereby
arts funding costs hospital beds. We

1355
00:38:01.432 --> 00:38:01.640
arts funding costs hospital beds. We
ran

1356
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.140
arts funding costs hospital beds. We
ﬂ" pay

1357
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:02.390
arts funding costs hospital beds. We
ran pay for

1358
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:03.890
arts funding costs hospital beds. We
can pay for more hospital beds in

1359
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.307
ran pay for more hospital beds in
our films, TV

1360
00:38:05.307 --> 00:38:05.432
can pay for more hospital beds in
ourfilms, TV dramas

1361
00:38:05.432 --> 00:38:05.807
can pay for more hospital beds in
our films, TV dramas and theatres,

1362
00:38:05.807 --> 00:38:07.599
our films, TV dramas and theatres,
but it’s likely that that might not

1363
00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:09.390
but it’s likely that that might not
happen submit up to and including a

1364
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.182
happen submit up to and including a
year, so this time next year might

1365
00:38:13.182 --> 00:38:14.557
year, so this time next year might
be the first time would properly get

1366
00:38:14.557 --> 00:38:15.099
be the first time would property get
to reopen. I

1367
00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:16.765
be the first time would properly get
to reopen. I guess what we need to

1368
00:38:16.765 --> 00:38:20.515
to reopen. I guess what we need to
possibly, specifically, is more

1369
00:38:20.515 --> 00:38:20.682
possibly, specifically, is more
ﬂexibility,

1370
00:38:20.682 --> 00:38:22.474
possibly, specifically, is more
flexibility, if it’s possible, on

1371
00:38:22.474 --> 00:38:24.682
ﬂexibility, if it’s possible, on
the job

1372
00:38:24.682 --> 00:38:25.140
flexibility, if it’s possible, on
thejob retention

1373
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.057
flexibility, if it’s possible, on
the job retention scheme for sectors

1374
00:38:26.057 --> 00:38:29.307
the job retention scheme for sectors
that will have zero income for many,

1375
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:30.307
that will have zero income for many,
many months, and unfortunately we

1376
00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:32.432
many months, and unfortunately we
have to start asking for an

1377
00:38:32.432 --> 00:38:33.432
have to start asking for an
investment package that will allow

1378
00:38:33.432 --> 00:38:35.265
investment package that will allow
us to bridge this gap in the short

1379
00:38:35.265 --> 00:38:36.932
us to bridge this gap in the short
term between not being able to open

1380
00:38:36.932 --> 00:38:41.140
term between not being able to open
and being able to open with all guns

1381
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.849
and being able to open with all guns
blazing, because I think we are a

1382
00:38:45.849 --> 00:38:47.057
blazing, because I think we are a
bit squeezed. Sometimes I think we

1383
00:38:47.057 --> 00:38:48.515
bit squeezed. Sometimes I think we
are squeamish about the arts

1384
00:38:48.515 --> 00:38:49.765
are squeamish about the arts
argument because we think it’s an

1385
00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:52.765
argument because we think it’s an
elitist thing, when in fact actually

1386
00:38:52.765 --> 00:38:54.599
elitist thing, when in fact actually
won in two people go to see a play

1387
00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:54.932
won in two peopla go to see a play
or a

1388
00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:57.849
won in two people go to see a play
or a musical every year. Think of

1389
00:38:57.849 --> 00:38:59.515
or a musical every year. Think of
all the success stories when it

1390
00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:00.682
all the success stories when it
comes to British films and TV

1391
00:39:00.682 --> 00:39:04.932
comes to British films and TV
dramas. There is such a global

1392
00:39:04.932 --> 00:39:06.932
dramas. There is such a global
thirst for British content and

1393
00:39:06.932 --> 00:39:09.099
thirst for British content and
British stories, in all their

1394
00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:15.682
British stories, in all their
wonderful modern mix. But it’s all

1395
00:39:15.682 --> 00:39:17.057
wonderful modern mix. But it’s all
interconnected so as a final point,

1396
00:39:17.057 --> 00:39:20.307
interconnected so as a final point,
even for people who don’t know to

1397
00:39:20.307 --> 00:39:21.682
even for people who don’t know to
the theatre, that half of the

1398
00:39:21.682 --> 00:39:23.015
the theatre, that half of the
country that doesn’t go, and that

1399
00:39:23.015 --> 00:39:24.724
country that doesn’t go, and that
was me growing up, and all I think

1400
00:39:24.724 --> 00:39:26.390
was me growing up, and all I think
about every night is how to get that

1401
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.890
about every night is how to get that
second half to go to the theatre,

1402
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.099
second half to go to the theatre,
what I think people enjoy and what

1403
00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:30.307
what I think peopla enjoy and what
has

1404
00:39:30.307 --> 00:39:32.307
what I think people enjoy and what
has been a great benefit in lockdown

1405
00:39:32.307 --> 00:39:33.724
has been a great benefit in lockdown
are all the TV dramas that have

1406
00:39:33.724 --> 00:39:34.515
are all the TV dramas that have
entertained and provided mental

1407
00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:38.182
entertained and provided mental
health and wellbeing to a nation in

1408
00:39:38.182 --> 00:39:39.890
health and wellbeing to a nation in
lockdown for I was so privileged to

1409
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.765
lockdown for I was so privileged to
be able to write and show Quiz,

1410
00:39:42.765 --> 00:39:44.682
be able to write and show Quiz,
which was a drama about a major

1411
00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.265
which was a drama about a major
scandal, and I was delighted hear

1412
00:39:46.265 --> 00:39:46.557
scandal, and Iwas delighted hear
from

1413
00:39:46.557 --> 00:39:49.182
scandal, and I was delighted hear
from families watching it. It’s all

1414
00:39:49.182 --> 00:39:52.974
from families watching it. It’s all
connected. I come from theatre for

1415
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.682
connected. I come from theatre for
the Phoebe Waller—Bridge, who sold

1416
00:39:54.682 --> 00:39:54.807
the Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who sold
ﬂea

1417
00:39:54.807 --> 00:39:56.307

flea back to the world, comes from

00:39:56.307 --> 00:39:56.474
ﬂea back to the world, comes from
theatre.

1419
00:39:56.474 --> 00:39:58.724
flea back to the world, comes from
theatre. You will start to notice a

1420
00:39:58.724 --> 00:40:00.682
theatre. You will start to notice a
difference if we can’t be saved, and

1421
00:40:00.682 --> 00:40:03.849
difference if we can’t be saved, and
the facts are that, without a bit of

00:40:03.849 --> 00:40:04.432
the facts are that, without a bit of
help, 7096 of

the facts are that, without a bit of
help, 70% of these theatres will be

closed by

closed by Christmas and they will

closed by Christmas and they will
not be able to reopen. Plank the

nothing pit in Southampton. Should

1432
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.974
nothing pit in Southampton. Should
there be a lifeline thrown to the

1433
00:40:22.974 --> 00:40:26.807
there be a lifeline thrown to the
arts by the government? Definitely.

1434
00:40:26.807 --> 00:40:29.015
arts by the government? Definitely.
I think what is needed, really, in

1435
00:40:29.015 --> 00:40:29.224
Ithink what is needed, really, in
this

1436
00:40:29.224 --> 00:40:31.890
I think what is needed, really, in
this timeline, and it was almost the

1437
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.849
this timeline, and it was almost the
fussiest of the announcements that

1438
00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:34.849
fussiest of the announcements that
were made last week in terms of the

1439
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:38.515
were made last week in terms of the
softening of restrictions, there was

1440
00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:40.224
softening of restrictions, there was
a lot of stuff on sport events but

1441
00:40:40.224 --> 00:40:43.432
a lot of stuff on sport events but
not much on cultural, and it was not

1442
00:40:43.432 --> 00:40:44.474
not much on cultural, and it was not
very easily specified, and actually

1443
00:40:44.474 --> 00:40:44.807
very easily specified, and actually
I think,

1444
00:40:44.807 --> 00:40:45.015
very easily specified, and actually
Ithink, if

1445
00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:46.682
very easily specified, and actually
I think, if you want to give theatre

1446
00:40:46.682 --> 00:40:48.474
I think, if you want to give theatre
and creative arts industry in

1447
00:40:48.474 --> 00:40:50.265
and creative arts industry in
future, you need to put a date on it

1448
00:40:50.265 --> 00:40:52.849
future, you need to put a date on it
so the public and say, brilliant,

1449
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:54.265
so the public and say, brilliant,
from September I can look forward to

1450
00:40:54.265 --> 00:40:54.890
from September I ran look forward to
going back to

1451
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.349
from September I can look forward to
going back to the theatre. But how

1452
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:58.807
going back to the theatre. But how
ran you put a

1453
00:40:58.807 --> 00:40:59.807
going back to the theatre. But how
can you put a date on it? You can’t

1454
00:40:59.807 --> 00:41:00.349
ran you put a date on it? You can’t
predict how the

1455
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:03.057
can you put a date on it? You can’t
predict how the pandemic will go.

1456
00:41:03.057 --> 00:41:04.974
predict how the pandemic will go.
But we heard about things happening

1457
00:41:04.974 --> 00:41:05.599
But we heard about things happening
in june and

1458
00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:06.224
But we heard about things happening
inJune and we heard that

1459
00:41:06.224 --> 00:41:09.015
inJune and we heard that
hairdressers may be going back into

1460
00:41:09.015 --> 00:41:10.849
hairdressers may be going back into
business, thank goodness, from July,

1461
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:11.224
business, thank goodness, from july,
and we

1462
00:41:11.224 --> 00:41:12.349
business, thank goodness, from July,
and we didn’t hear anything about

1463
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:13.349
and we didn’t hear anything about
the theatre or other cultural

1464
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:16.599
the theatre or other cultural
events, and I think it’s important

1465
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.640
events, and I think it’s important
you know, gigs and concerts. I

1466
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.265
you know, gigs and concerts. I
appreciate there at the end of the

1467
00:41:20.265 --> 00:41:20.432
appreciate there at the end of the
stale

1468
00:41:20.432 --> 00:41:21.265
appreciate there at the end of the
scale because they are mass

1469
00:41:21.265 --> 00:41:21.474
sale because they are mass
gatherings,

1470
00:41:21.474 --> 00:41:22.640
scale because they are mass
gatherings, and that is what is

1471
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.599
gatherings, and that is what is
advised against, but if there were a

1472
00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.890
advised against, but if there were a
window, because I know from my own

1473
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.974
window, because I know from my own
and I’m sure the panellists will

1474
00:41:28.974 --> 00:41:30.265
and I’m sure the panellists will
agree, I wouldn’t mind booking

1475
00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:30.349
agree, Iwouldn’t mind booking
somethings

1476
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:31.932
agree, I wouldn’t mind booking
somethings into look forward to at

1477
00:41:31.932 --> 00:41:32.932
somethings into look forward to at
Christmas, and that would give

1478
00:41:32.932 --> 00:41:35.015
Christmas, and that would give
theatre industry a lifeline if they

1479
00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:36.640
theatre industry a lifeline if they
were able to open bookings from a

1480
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.974
were able to open bookings from a
certain time I appreciate the

1481
00:41:37.974 --> 00:41:40.724
certain time I appreciate the
science on it is not

1482
00:41:40.724 --> 00:41:42.265
science on it is not
straightforward, but I feel they

1483
00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:44.057
straightforward, but I feel they
have been cast adrift somewhat, and

1484
00:41:44.057 --> 00:41:45.182
have been cast adrift somewhat, and
it’s no wonder that people like

1485
00:41:45.182 --> 00:41:45.640
it’s no wonder that peopla like
james and

1486
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.974
it’s no wonder that people like
James and his colleagues in that

1487
00:41:47.974 --> 00:41:48.640
james and his colleagues in that
industry are

1488
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.140
James and his colleagues in that
industry are in complete limbo,

1489
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.057
industry are in complete limbo,
frankly not knowing when they can

1490
00:41:51.057 --> 00:41:51.807
frankly not knowing when they ran
get back not

1491
00:41:51.807 --> 00:41:53.057
frankly not knowing when they can
get back notjust a normal but even

1492
00:41:53.057 --> 00:41:53.432
get back not just a normal but even
the new

1493
00:41:53.432 --> 00:41:54.265
get back notjust a normal but even
the new normal everybody is talking

1494
00:41:54.265 --> 00:41:57.224
the new normal everybody is talking
about. james

1495
00:41:57.224 --> 00:41:57.849
the new normal everybody is talking
about. James and Camilla are

1496
00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:58.057
about. james and Camilla are
suggesting

1497
00:41:58.057 --> 00:42:01.640
about. James and Camilla are
suggesting a bailout. Andy, can the

1498
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:01.807
suggesting a bailout. Andy, ran the
government

1499
00:42:01.807 --> 00:42:02.807
suggesting a bailout. Andy, can the
government afford it? Rishi Sunak is

1500
00:42:02.807 --> 00:42:04.099
government afford it? Rishi Sunak is
talking about a recession the like

1501
00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:06.182
talking about a recession the like
of which we have never known coming

1502
00:42:06.182 --> 00:42:08.265
of which we have never known coming
to the track and spending a fortune

1503
00:42:08.265 --> 00:42:11.432
to the track and spending a fortune
on bailing out, supporting companies

1504
00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:14.640
on bailing out, supporting companies
and furlough schemes. Can we really

1505
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:14.974
and furlough schemes. (“an we really
afford to

1506
00:42:14.974 --> 00:42:17.807
and furlough schemes. Can we really
afford to support theatres as well?

1507
00:42:17.807 --> 00:42:19.974
afford to support theatres as well?
Well, what would we lose? These

1508
00:42:19.974 --> 00:42:23.682
Well, what would we lose? These
organisations are the fabric of our

1509
00:42:23.682 --> 00:42:27.640
organisations are the fabric of our
cities, the life of our society. As

1510
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.640
cities, the life of our society. As
a former Culture Secretary, I want

1511
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.640
a former Culture Secretary, I want
to agree with Camilla, James and

1512
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.140
to agree with Camilla, james and
Gerald, it is

1513
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:32.390
to agree with Camilla, James and
Gerald, it is tremendously

1514
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.932
Gerald, it is tremendously
important. James said sometimes

1515
00:42:34.932 --> 00:42:35.390
important. james said sometimes
peopla are

1516
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:36.724
important. James said sometimes
people are squeamish about arts

1517
00:42:36.724 --> 00:42:37.224
peopla are squeamish about arts
funding,

1518
00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:38.640
people are squeamish about arts
funding, well, we are not in

1519
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.140
funding, well, we are not in
Manchester. We see the benefit of

1520
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.640
Manchester. We see the benefit of
investing in culture and the arts

1521
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.057
investing in culture and the arts
and what it does to bring people

1522
00:42:43.057 --> 00:42:43.640
and what it does to bring peopla
into the city,

1523
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.474
and what it does to bring people
into the city, so we paid our arts

1524
00:42:48.474 --> 00:42:52.640
into the city, so we paid our arts
bill in advance we have supported

1525
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.099
bill in advance we have supported
artists and we set up a streaming

1526
00:42:55.099 --> 00:42:56.432
artists and we set up a streaming
platform which has been broadcasting

1527
00:42:56.432 --> 00:42:57.432
platform which has been broadcasting
Greater Manchester music and talent

1528
00:42:57.432 --> 00:42:59.307
Greater Manchester music and talent
around the world, and the money

1529
00:42:59.307 --> 00:43:00.390
around the world, and the money
raised through it is supporting

1530
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.515
raised through it is supporting
venues. So you don’t need to

1531
00:43:02.515 --> 00:43:05.307
venues. So you don’t need to
convince us, but I also want to say

1532
00:43:05.307 --> 00:43:06.849
convince us, but I also want to say
about the sporting life of the

1533
00:43:06.849 --> 00:43:08.307
about the sporting life of the
country, because there is a drive to

1534
00:43:08.307 --> 00:43:10.015
country, because there is a drive to
get the Premier League back but I am

1535
00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:11.432
get the Premier League back but I am
worried about what is going to

1536
00:43:11.432 --> 00:43:12.474
worried about what is going to
happen to lower league football

1537
00:43:12.474 --> 00:43:14.349
happen to lower league football
clubs they have to play behind

1538
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.515
dubs they have to play behind
closed

1539
00:43:14.515 --> 00:43:17.974
clubs they have to play behind
closed doors. Of course, there is a

1540
00:43:17.974 --> 00:43:19.140
closed doors. Of course, there is a
lot more private money in football,

1541
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.807
lot more private money in football,
but I believe we need to see the

1542
00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:22.807
but I believe we need to see the
Premier League setting up a football

1543
00:43:22.807 --> 00:43:25.015
Premier League setting up a football
solidarity fund so that the whole of

1544
00:43:25.015 --> 00:43:25.265
solidarity fund so that the whola of
the

1545
00:43:25.265 --> 00:43:28.015
solidarity fund so that the whole of
the football pyramid can be

1546
00:43:28.015 --> 00:43:29.015
the football pyramid can be
supported through this, because it

1547
00:43:29.015 --> 00:43:29.932
supported through this, because it
won’t just be

1548
00:43:29.932 --> 00:43:31.015
supported through this, because it
won’tjust be theatres that are

1549
00:43:31.015 --> 00:43:31.682
won’t just be theatres that are
going dark,

1550
00:43:31.682 --> 00:43:32.807
won’tjust be theatres that are
going dark, we will seat lower

1551
00:43:32.807 --> 00:43:34.307
going dark, we will seat lower
league football clubs going out of

1552
00:43:34.307 --> 00:43:37.557
league football clubs going out of
business one after another, and I

1553
00:43:37.557 --> 00:43:41.015
business one after another, and I
think culture and the arts, yes, but

1554
00:43:41.015 --> 00:43:43.474
think culture and the arts, yes, but
we need to dump to step in because,

1555
00:43:43.474 --> 00:43:45.265
we need to dump to step in because,
in the end, we have to protect as of

1556
00:43:45.265 --> 00:43:46.807
in the end, we have to protect as of
our economy so we can bounce back

1557
00:43:46.807 --> 00:43:47.182
our economy so we ran bounce back
more quickly

1558
00:43:47.182 --> 00:43:49.265
our economy so we can bounce back
more quickly but, when it comes to

1559
00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:50.807
more quickly but, when it comes to
football, I think the Premier League

1560
00:43:50.807 --> 00:43:52.349
football, I think the Premier League
has to step forward and protect

1561
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:53.849
has to step forward and protect
lower league clubs and it will be

1562
00:43:53.849 --> 00:43:55.224
lower league clubs and it will be
crucial to keep them in business.

1563
00:43:55.224 --> 00:43:59.432
crucial to keep them in business.
See if they respond. Given that the

1564
00:43:59.432 --> 00:44:01.390
See if they respond. Given that the
lockdown was relatively short in

1565
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.474
lockdown was relatively short in
Denmark and not particularly strict,

1566
00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:02.974
Denmark and not particularty strict,
was failing at

1567
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:04.474
Denmark and not particularly strict,
was failing at theatres an issue?

1568
00:44:04.474 --> 00:44:08.640
was failing at theatres an issue?
Yes, there has been a debate about

1569
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.515
Yes, there has been a debate about
culture, until

1570
00:44:09.515 --> 00:44:09.807
Yes, there has been a debate about
culture, untila

1571
00:44:09.807 --> 00:44:10.474
Yes, there has been a debate about
culture, until a cultural life plays

1572
00:44:10.474 --> 00:44:10.807
culture, until a cultural life plays
a rola

1573
00:44:10.807 --> 00:44:12.890
culture, until a cultural life plays
a role when we are a lockdown, and I

1574
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.307
a rola when we are a lockdown, and I
think are

1575
00:44:13.307 --> 00:44:14.640
a role when we are a lockdown, and I
think are appreciating culture more.

1576
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.807
think are appreciating culture more.
There has been a lot of culture in

1577
00:44:17.807 --> 00:44:19.640
There has been a lot of culture in
the UK as well, and I think we all

1578
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.974
the UK as well, and I think we all
appreciate that I would agree. I

1579
00:44:21.974 --> 00:44:26.265
appreciate that I would agree. I
think the biggest thing for theatres

1580
00:44:26.265 --> 00:44:27.682
think the biggest thing for theatres
and all of our institutions is to

1581
00:44:27.682 --> 00:44:29.015
and all of our institutions is to
know what’s going to happen, because

1582
00:44:29.015 --> 00:44:30.974
know what’s going to happen, because
they won’t be able to ramp up. They

1583
00:44:30.974 --> 00:44:32.599
they won’t be able to ramp up. They
will probably have to run with 30%

1584
00:44:32.599 --> 00:44:33.432
will probably have to nm with 3096
in the

1585
00:44:33.432 --> 00:44:34.474
will probably have to run with 30%
in the beginning and then they can

1586
00:44:34.474 --> 00:44:36.557
in the beginning and then they ran
ramp up

1587
00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:37.640
in the beginning and then they can
ramp up slowly into 21, but they

1588
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.640
ramp up slowly into 21, but they
need to know the if theatres say, in

1589
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.224
need to know the if theatres say, in
january 21, we

1590
00:44:43.224 --> 00:44:44.307
need to know the if theatres say, in
January 21, we are going to have

1591
00:44:44.307 --> 00:44:44.682
january 21, we are going to have
this show

1592
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:45.932
January 21, we are going to have
this show on, I think many people to

1593
00:44:45.932 --> 00:44:46.182
this show on, I think many peopla to
book

1594
00:44:46.182 --> 00:44:47.349
this show on, I think many people to
book tickets because we want to get

1595
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:52.432
book tickets because we want to get
out.

1596
00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:52.724
ﬂ

1597
00:44:52.724 --> 00:44:55.849
I want to resist the time they like
because it is an investment for the

1598
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:57.849
because it is an investment for the
amount of money that these venues in

1599
00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:00.099
amount of money that these venues in
Manchester and Andy you are right,

1600
00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:01.807
Manchester and Andy you are right,
Manchester is an extraordinary city

1601
00:45:01.807 --> 00:45:04.224
Manchester is an extraordinary city
of music and comedy and theatre and

1602
00:45:04.224 --> 00:45:06.224
of music and comedy and theatre and
television production, the money we

1603
00:45:06.224 --> 00:45:09.099
television production, the money we
need to cover the shortfall until we

1604
00:45:09.099 --> 00:45:09.432
need to cover the shortfall until we
ran properly

1605
00:45:09.432 --> 00:45:10.807
need to cover the shortfall until we
can properly reopen is almost

1606
00:45:10.807 --> 00:45:11.807
ran property reopen is almost
instantly

1607
00:45:11.807 --> 00:45:14.307
can properly reopen is almost
instantly paid back in the annual

1608
00:45:14.307 --> 00:45:16.182
instantly paid back in the annual
tax revenue and the VAT. In London

1609
00:45:16.182 --> 00:45:18.099
tax revenue and the VAT. In London
alone, to a spring in £2 billion

1610
00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:20.224
alone, to a spring in £2 billion
worth of cash every year,

1611
00:45:20.224 --> 00:45:23.390
worth of cash every year,
specifically for London theatre.

1612
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:24.140
specifically for London theatre.
just finally,

specifically for London theatre.
Just finally, Fiona, I want to agree

just finally, Fiona, I want to agree
with Camilla,

1615
00:45:26.682 --> 00:45:28.015
Just finally, Fiona, I want to agree
with Camilla, the question is what

1616
00:45:28.015 --> 00:45:29.849
with Camilla, the question is what
are we ending the lockdown for, it

1617
00:45:29.849 --> 00:45:33.057
are we ending the lockdown for, it
is to get kids back and reopen our

1618
00:45:33.057 --> 00:45:35.557
is to get kids back and reopen our
businesses, but there is a huge part

1619
00:45:35.557 --> 00:45:37.432
businesses, but there is a huge part
of British people, we are a sociable

1620
00:45:37.432 --> 00:45:37.807
of British peopla, we are a sociabla
animal

1621
00:45:37.807 --> 00:45:40.265
of British people, we are a sociable
animal and in terms of our

00:45:40.265 --> 00:45:41.474
animal and in terms of our
psychological health and spirit and

1623

psychological health and spirit and
morale, all the key workers and we

1624

morale, all the key workers and we
should immediately give a free

1625
00:45:46.432 --> 00:45:48.474

ticket to immediately is such a

1626
00:45:48.474 --> 00:45:51.557
ticket to immediately is such a
vital part of our national life and

1627
00:45:51.557 --> 00:45:53.224
vital part of our national life and
we can’t completely contribute to

1628
00:45:53.224 --> 00:45:54.849
we can’t completely contribute to
that, but in order to do that, we

1629
00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:57.640
that, but in order to do that, we
need to be safe in the interim. We

1630
00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.057
need to be safe in the interim. We
have had a couple of tweets in,

1638
00:46:12.307 --> 00:46:18.015
theatre resume this year. Nothing
wrong with pantomime! If theatres

1639
00:46:18.015 --> 00:46:20.307
wrong with pantomime! If theatres
are laws, our cultural voices

1640
00:46:20.307 --> 00:46:21.474
are laws, our cultural voices
diminished and creative voices

1641
00:46:21.474 --> 00:46:22.807
diminished and creative voices

1650
00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:36.849
and Gerald are saying about the
importance of the art sector. It is

1651
00:46:36.849 --> 00:46:38.224
importance of the art sector. It is
a huge economic contributor as James

a huge economic contributor as james
"TY

1653
00:46:39.015 --> 00:46:40.724
a huge economic contributor as James
very powerfully set out but it is so

1654
00:46:40.724 --> 00:46:42.307
very powerfuuy set out but it is so
much more, it

1655
00:46:42.307 --> 00:46:43.724
very powerfully set out but it is so
much more, it enriches our cultural

lives, it gives entertainment and
meaning and it attracts tourists.

meaning and it attracts tourists.
Given that, can you see the

1659
00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:49.807
Given that, ran you see the
government

1660

Given that, can you see the
government extending a helping hand.

1661
00:46:51.057 --> 00:46:54.599
government extending a helping hand.
In terms of what we have done

1662
00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:55.724
In terms of what we have done
already, I would strongly encourage

1663
00:46:55.724 --> 00:46:58.307
already, I would strongly encourage
every arts organisation to fully use

1664
00:46:58.307 --> 00:47:01.182
every arts organisation to fully use
all of the existing schemes. James

1665
00:47:01.182 --> 00:47:01.974
all of the existing schemes. James
mentioned the furlough scheme

1666
00:47:01.974 --> 00:47:04.182
mentioned the furlough scheme
already and every organisation in

1667
00:47:04.182 --> 00:47:05.599
already and every organisation in
the position of theatre should be

1668
00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.307
the position of theatre should be
using that scheme to have their

1669
00:47:07.307 --> 00:47:10.015
using that scheme to have their
staff it cannot work paid an 80% of

1670
00:47:10.015 --> 00:47:10.349
staff it rannot work paid an 8096 of
the regular

1671
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:11.224
staff it cannot work paid an 80% of
the regular salary and the

1672
00:47:11.224 --> 00:47:13.432
the regular salary and the
government is funding that and has

1673
00:47:13.432 --> 00:47:15.265
government is funding that and has
extended it recently. There are

1674
00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:18.015
extended it recently. There are
significant loan schemes available

1675
00:47:18.015 --> 00:47:19.390
significant loan schemes available
and the government backed loan

1676
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:22.224
and the government backed loan
schemes have paid out over £20

1677
00:47:22.224 --> 00:47:24.349
schemes have paid out over £20
billion and I would encourage...

1678
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:27.307
billion and I would encourage...
There is no question that the

1679
00:47:27.307 --> 00:47:29.265
There is no question that the
government has made myself out late

1680
00:47:29.265 --> 00:47:30.765
government has made myself out late
to help business, but a lot of

1681
00:47:30.765 --> 00:47:33.682
to help business, but a lot of
peopla are in

people are in this and cannot access

the furlough scheme and people say

1685
00:47:35.807 --> 00:47:39.640
the furlough scheme and people say
the loans do not apply and I am

1686
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.599
the loans do not apply and I am
asking, is there anything additional

1687
00:47:40.599 --> 00:47:44.807
asking, is there anything additional
that the government can do? Just

1688
00:47:44.807 --> 00:47:45.265

rising, clearly the art sector does

1696
00:47:54.807 --> 00:47:55.724
rising, dearty the art sector does
have a unique

1697
00:47:55.724 --> 00:47:56.474
rising, clearly the art sector does
have a unique set of circumstances

1698
00:47:56.474 --> 00:47:59.265
have a unique set of circumstances
and it will be the most difficult to

1699
00:47:59.265 --> 00:48:01.182
and it will be the most difficult to
restart for obvious reasons and this

1700
00:48:01.182 --> 00:48:02.807
restart for obvious reasons and this
task force launched yesterday is

1701
00:48:02.807 --> 00:48:03.224
task force hunched yesterday is
designed to

1702
00:48:03.224 --> 00:48:04.432
task force launched yesterday is
designed to address exactly these

1703
00:48:04.432 --> 00:48:07.099
designed to address exactly these
issues. I hope again, as we get

1704
00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:07.974
issues. I hope again, as we get
through the situation, as the

1705
00:48:07.974 --> 00:48:10.015
through the situation, as the
science improves and we get things

1706
00:48:10.015 --> 00:48:11.807
science improves and we get things
like antibody testing and if it is

1707
00:48:11.807 --> 00:48:13.640
like antibody testing and if it is
rolled out and there is some level

1708
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.474
rolled out and there is some level
of immunity, which we hope, but we

1709
00:48:15.474 --> 00:48:17.557
of immunity, which we hope, but we
cannot be certain, but we hope there

1710
00:48:17.557 --> 00:48:17.932
cannot be certain, but we hope there
will be,

1711
00:48:17.932 --> 00:48:18.224
rannot be certain, but we hope there
will be, people

1712
00:48:18.224 --> 00:48:19.265
cannot be certain, but we hope there
will be, people who have those

1713
00:48:19.265 --> 00:48:20.515
will be, people who have those
antibodies and immunity probably can

1714
00:48:20.515 --> 00:48:21.599
antibodies and immunity probably ran
go to the

1715
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:22.349
antibodies and immunity probably can
go to the theatre and I think

1716
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:23.807
go to the theatre and I think
science again can really help us get

1717
00:48:23.807 --> 00:48:24.224
science again ran really help us get
through this

1718
00:48:24.224 --> 00:48:25.057
science again can really help us get
through this but in the meantime

1719
00:48:25.057 --> 00:48:26.557
through this but in the meantime
that task force is here to help with

1720
00:48:26.557 --> 00:48:29.265
that task force is here to help with
exactly what with what James and

1721
00:48:29.265 --> 00:48:29.432
exactly what with what james and
Gerald

1722
00:48:29.432 --> 00:48:30.807
exactly what with what James and
Gerald are rising. I want to squeeze

1723
00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:34.265
Gerald are rising. I want to squeeze
in another question which is

1724
00:48:34.265 --> 00:48:35.807
in another question which is
pre—recorded. This question is from

1725
00:48:35.807 --> 00:48:37.765
pre-recorded. This question is from
Akash Lal.

1726
00:48:37.765 --> 00:48:40.890
Would you rather eat a sandwich made
by someone wearing a nice smile

1727
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:45.890
or by someone wearing a facemask?

1728
00:48:48.224 --> 00:48:51.224
Back to the facemask, that dominated
the conversation and we have a

1729
00:48:51.224 --> 00:48:52.724
the conversation and we have a
situation where the government is

1730
00:48:52.724 --> 00:48:54.599
situation where the government is
advising people to wear face

1731
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.807
advising people to wear face
coverings if they are in an enclosed

1732
00:48:56.807 --> 00:48:58.724
coverings if they are in an enclosed
situation indoors where they cannot

1733
00:48:58.724 --> 00:49:01.057
situation indoors where they cannot
easily socially distance but

1734
00:49:01.057 --> 00:49:03.474
easily socially distance but
otherwise, no, Camilla what is your

1735
00:49:03.474 --> 00:49:05.932
otherwise, no, Camilla what is your
view? The jury is out on face masks.

1736
00:49:05.932 --> 00:49:07.724
view? The jury is out on face masks.
The government had to say face

1737
00:49:07.724 --> 00:49:08.932
The government had to say face
coverings because they did not want

1738
00:49:08.932 --> 00:49:11.557
coverings because they did not want
members of the public by up surgical

1739
00:49:11.557 --> 00:49:13.807
members of the public by up surgical
masks that could be used by front

1740
00:49:13.807 --> 00:49:15.349
masks that could be used by front
line NHS and carers. Would you

1741
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:16.974
line NHS and carers. Would you
rather have a sandwich served to you

1742
00:49:16.974 --> 00:49:19.515
rather have a sandwich served to you
by someone wearing a mask with micro

1743
00:49:19.515 --> 00:49:21.599
by someone wearing a mask with micro
I would rather have someone served

1744
00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:24.349
I would rather have someone served
it so much he was a Bain hygiene

1745
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.640
it so much he was a Bain hygiene
mles in

1746
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.724
it so much he was a Bain hygiene
rules in general. I would not mind

1747
00:49:28.724 --> 00:49:29.182
mles in general. I would not mind
either way,

1748
00:49:29.182 --> 00:49:30.224
rules in general. I would not mind
either way, they could wear a face

1749
00:49:30.224 --> 00:49:32.599
either way, they could wear a face
mask or choose not to, what is

1750
00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:34.265
mask or choose not to, what is
interesting is some of the evidence

1751
00:49:34.265 --> 00:49:37.015
interesting is some of the evidence
that went into Sage which came from

1752
00:49:37.015 --> 00:49:38.265
that went into Sage which came from
the Royal Society and said one

1753
00:49:38.265 --> 00:49:39.224
the Royal Society and said one
psychological benefit of wearing

1754
00:49:39.224 --> 00:49:41.765
psychological benefit of wearing
face masks in public, particularly

1755
00:49:41.765 --> 00:49:42.765
face masks in public, particularty
on transport

1756
00:49:42.765 --> 00:49:43.682
face masks in public, particularly
on transport and in supermarkets as

1757
00:49:43.682 --> 00:49:45.807
on transport and in supermarkets as
it reminded people of the need to

1758
00:49:45.807 --> 00:49:47.515
it reminded people of the need to
distance and that is important. On

1759
00:49:47.515 --> 00:49:48.807
distance and that is important. On
the balance of probability, the

1760
00:49:48.807 --> 00:49:49.015
distance and that is important. On
the balance of probability, thejury

1761
00:49:49.015 --> 00:49:49.724
the balance of probability, the jury
is out, they

1762
00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:51.349
the balance of probability, thejury
is out, they could help or they

1763
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:53.640
is out, they could help or they
might not, but if you think it helps

1764
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.807
might not, but if you think it helps
to stop transmission to others and

1765
00:49:54.807 --> 00:49:57.224
to stop transmission to others and
if you think it helps because it

1766
00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:58.849
if you think it helps because it
puts you off getting to close on

1767
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:59.057
puts you off getting to dose on
pub“:

1768
00:49:59.057 --> 00:50:00.515
puts you off getting to close on
public transport and elsewhere, it

1769
00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:02.765
public transport and elsewhere, it
is probably no bad thing. It is

1770
00:50:02.765 --> 00:50:03.682
is probably no bad thing. It is
fascinating, in Germany it is

1771
00:50:03.682 --> 00:50:08.015
fascinating, in Germany it is
compulsory to wear a mask on public

1772
00:50:08.015 --> 00:50:09.932
compulsory to wear a mask on public
transport and while shopping, in

1773
00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:10.307
transport and whila shopping, in
Spain they

1774
00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:13.807
transport and while shopping, in
Spain they are compulsory in indoor

1775
00:50:13.807 --> 00:50:15.765
Spain they are compulsory in indoor
spaces and outdoor ones if you

1776
00:50:15.765 --> 00:50:16.765
spaces and outdoor ones if you
cannot maintain distance. In

1777
00:50:16.765 --> 00:50:16.932
rannot maintain distance. In
Denmark,

1778
00:50:16.932 --> 00:50:17.932
cannot maintain distance. In
Denmark, you have not gone along

1779
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:21.974
Denmark, you have not gone along
with it all. It is not part of our

1780
00:50:21.974 --> 00:50:23.599
with it all. It is not part of our
culture, as it isn’t here either. In

1781
00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:26.015
culture, as it isn’t here either. In
many ways it is something that makes

1782
00:50:26.015 --> 00:50:26.640
many ways it is something that makes
peopla a little

1783
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.765
many ways it is something that makes
people a little bit scared to see

1784
00:50:28.765 --> 00:50:29.432
peopla a little bit scared to see
this, but

1785
00:50:29.432 --> 00:50:29.682
peopla a little bit scared to see
this, butl

1786
00:50:29.682 --> 00:50:30.390
people a little bit scared to see
this, but I don’t know enough about

1787
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.682
this, but I don’t know enough about
the science and I don’t have a

1788
00:50:32.682 --> 00:50:34.057
the science and I don’t have a
strong opinion. What I will say is

1789
00:50:34.057 --> 00:50:34.474
strong opinion. what I will say is
that I

1790
00:50:34.474 --> 00:50:36.682
strong opinion. What I will say is
that I think we have to have a deep

1791
00:50:36.682 --> 00:50:38.182
that I think we have to have a deep
conversation and I hope the

1792
00:50:38.182 --> 00:50:39.599
conversation and I hope the
government will start that soon, a

1793
00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:42.015
government will start that soon, a
deep conversation about what is the

1794
00:50:42.015 --> 00:50:44.974
deep conversation about what is the
new normal? How are we going to live

1795
00:50:44.974 --> 00:50:47.015
new normal? How are we going to live
together the next year, for example,

1796
00:50:47.015 --> 00:50:48.807
together the next year, for example,
and I think we have to have new

1797
00:50:48.807 --> 00:50:51.390
and I think we have to have new
international standards of

1798
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:54.807
international standards of
travelling, on planes, commuter

1799
00:50:54.807 --> 00:50:56.432
travelling, on planes, commuter
trains in the morning, we have to

1800
00:50:56.432 --> 00:50:58.224
trains in the morning, we have to
have new standards and I would hope

1801
00:50:58.224 --> 00:51:01.515
have new standards and I would hope
that the UK could also be a leader

1802
00:51:01.515 --> 00:51:02.807
that the UK could also be a leader
in this globally, because this is

1803
00:51:02.807 --> 00:51:04.932
in this globally, because this is
almost like after 9/11, where

1804
00:51:04.932 --> 00:51:06.682
almost like after 9/11, where
everything changed in terms of how

1805
00:51:06.682 --> 00:51:07.890
everything changed in terms of how
we were travelling across the world

1806
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:10.349
we were travelling across the world
and it is the same moment now and we

1807
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:11.807
and it is the same moment now and we
need new standards for everything.

1808
00:51:11.807 --> 00:51:14.057
need new standards for everything.
It doesn’t have to be the same in

1809
00:51:14.057 --> 00:51:15.682
It doesn’t have to be the same in
other countries, but I think we need

1810
00:51:15.682 --> 00:51:17.057
other countries, but I think we need
to understand this new normal and

1811
00:51:17.057 --> 00:51:20.307
to understand this new normal and
that is why I am hoping, I heard you

1812
00:51:20.307 --> 00:51:21.724
that is why I am hoping, I heard you
before getting a little bit

1813
00:51:21.724 --> 00:51:23.432
before getting a little bit
defensive about what the government

1814
00:51:23.432 --> 00:51:24.932
defensive about what the government
has done and not done and I hope

1815
00:51:24.932 --> 00:51:25.640
has done and not done and I hope
that we can

1816
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.015
has done and not done and I hope
that we ran get

1817
00:51:26.015 --> 00:51:26.849
has done and not done and I hope
that we can get into a situation

1818
00:51:26.849 --> 00:51:27.182
that we ran get into a situation
where

1819
00:51:27.182 --> 00:51:29.307
that we can get into a situation
where we all can recognise, this is

1820
00:51:29.307 --> 00:51:29.640
where we all ran recognise, this is
a new

1821
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.765
where we all can recognise, this is
a new situation, mistakes have been

1822
00:51:30.765 --> 00:51:32.849
a new situation, mistakes have been
made and I will take responsibility

1823
00:51:32.849 --> 00:51:34.974
made and I will take responsibility
as Prime Minister that we did not

1824
00:51:34.974 --> 00:51:37.057
as Prime Minister that we did not
prepare properly for a pandemic like

1825
00:51:37.057 --> 00:51:38.307
prepare property for a pandemic like
this. We

1826
00:51:38.307 --> 00:51:39.224
prepare properly for a pandemic like
this. We had Sarge, swine flu and

1827
00:51:39.224 --> 00:51:39.682
this. We had Sarge, swine ﬂu and
all these

1828
00:51:39.682 --> 00:51:40.849
this. We had Sarge, swine flu and
all these things but we did not

1829
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:43.224
all these things but we did not
prepare properly and I do not think

1830
00:51:43.224 --> 00:51:43.515
prepare property and I do not think
the

1831
00:51:43.515 --> 00:51:47.682
prepare properly and I do not think
the British Government did any thing

1832
00:51:47.682 --> 00:51:49.557
the British Government did any thing
and we have to be in a mode where we

1833
00:51:49.557 --> 00:51:51.682
and we have to be in a mode where we
breathe breathe and now is the new

1834
00:51:51.682 --> 00:51:53.349
breathe breathe and now is the new
normal and we need to be part of

1835
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:54.682
normal and we need to be part of
doing that and talking about how we

1836
00:51:54.682 --> 00:51:57.932
doing that and talking about how we
want to do that and get out of this

1837
00:51:57.932 --> 00:51:59.140
want to do that and get out of this
automatic reaction where we say we

1838
00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.807
automatic reaction where we say we
did not do anything wrong and surely

1839
00:52:01.807 --> 00:52:03.265
did not do anything wrong and surely
we cannot find a fault with

1840
00:52:03.265 --> 00:52:05.890
we cannot find a fault with
anything, after all this, we also

1841
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:07.099
anything, after all this, we also
have to evaluate and create new

1842
00:52:07.099 --> 00:52:11.974
have to evaluate and create new
standards together. James. Coming

1843
00:52:11.974 --> 00:52:12.390
standards together. james. Coming
back to

1844
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.182
standards together. James. Coming
back to the question, would you

1845
00:52:13.182 --> 00:52:16.307
back to the question, would you
rather be served by someone... I

1846
00:52:16.307 --> 00:52:19.349
rather be served by someone... I
didn’t answer that question. You

1847
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:20.932
didn’t answer that question. You
didn’t, you’re not keen on

1848
00:52:20.932 --> 00:52:22.432
didn’t, you’re not keen on
facemasks. Would you rather be said

1849
00:52:22.432 --> 00:52:24.182
facemasks. Would you rather be said
by someone wearing a face mask? I

1850
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:27.515
by someone wearing a face mask? I
just can’t wait to be served by

1851
00:52:27.515 --> 00:52:28.890
just can’t wait to be served by
someone. A sandwich or a pie would

1852
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:33.432
someone. A sandwich or a pie would
go down great right now stop I wear

1853
00:52:33.432 --> 00:52:34.724
go down great right now stop I wear
one occasionally. I think we will

1854
00:52:34.724 --> 00:52:36.224
one occasionally. I think we will
get used to it. I think it would

1855
00:52:36.224 --> 00:52:38.807
get used to it. I think it would
become the new normal. I think it is

1856
00:52:38.807 --> 00:52:40.224
become the new normal. I think it is
individual choice and I don’t know

1857
00:52:40.224 --> 00:52:42.224
individual choice and I don’t know
how you would legislate for it.

1858
00:52:42.224 --> 00:52:42.474
how you would lagislate for it.
Andy?

1859
00:52:42.474 --> 00:52:45.765
how you would legislate for it.
Andy? Where do you stand on the

1860
00:52:45.765 --> 00:52:47.140
Andy? Where do you stand on the
discussion about face coverings or

1861
00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.432
discussion about face coverings or
facemasks? I think we will have to

1862
00:52:50.432 --> 00:52:51.682
facemasks? I think we will have to
work quite hard to build confidence

1863
00:52:51.682 --> 00:52:54.515
work quite hard to build confidence
in the public to go back into cities

1864
00:52:54.515 --> 00:52:56.099
in the public to go back into cities
and support the cultural venues and

1865
00:52:56.099 --> 00:52:58.724
and support the cultural venues and
bars and restaurants as we were

1866
00:52:58.724 --> 00:53:00.599
bars and restaurants as we were
discussing a moment ago. If it can

1867
00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:01.182
discussing a moment ago. If it ran
help build that

1868
00:53:01.182 --> 00:53:03.099
discussing a moment ago. If it can
help build that confidence, then why

1869
00:53:03.099 --> 00:53:05.015
help build that confidence, then why
not. Sometimes people can see a face

1870
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:05.807
not. Sometimes people ran see a face
mask and

1871
00:53:05.807 --> 00:53:07.557
not. Sometimes people can see a face
mask and think it is someone being

1872
00:53:07.557 --> 00:53:08.557
mask and think it is someone being
distrustful of everyone, but as

1873
00:53:08.557 --> 00:53:09.349
distmstful of everyone, but as
james said,

1874
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:10.849
distrustful of everyone, but as
James said, it is the opposite, it

1875
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:11.432
james said, it is the opposite, it
is quite a

1876
00:53:11.432 --> 00:53:12.432
James said, it is the opposite, it
is quite a public spirited thing to

1877
00:53:12.432 --> 00:53:13.765
is quite a public spirited thing to
do because it is of easily reducing

1878
00:53:13.765 --> 00:53:16.182
do because it is of easily reducing
the risk of you giving the infection

1879
00:53:16.182 --> 00:53:17.807
the risk of you giving the infection
to other people. I think we should

1880
00:53:17.807 --> 00:53:19.349
to other people. I think we should
explain more about it, why it is a

1881
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:21.307
explain more about it, why it is a
good thing and why people are going

1882
00:53:21.307 --> 00:53:21.974
good thing and why peopla are going
to have

1883
00:53:21.974 --> 00:53:24.057
good thing and why people are going
to have to expect to see more of it,

1884
00:53:24.057 --> 00:53:26.807
to have to expect to see more of it,
I certainly feel in our city we need

1885
00:53:26.807 --> 00:53:29.140
I certainly feel in our city we need
to build a clear reputation for

1886
00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:29.932
to build a dear reputation for
being a

1887
00:53:29.932 --> 00:53:31.182
to build a clear reputation for
being a safety first city to get the

1888
00:53:31.182 --> 00:53:35.265
being a safety first city to get the
visitors to come back. I have been

1889
00:53:35.265 --> 00:53:36.640
visitors to come back. I have been
saying to the fashion industry, we

1890
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.057
saying to the fashion industry, we
are renowned for music and fashion

1891
00:53:39.057 --> 00:53:42.057
are renowned for music and fashion
as well, let us design the must have

1892
00:53:42.057 --> 00:53:43.474
as well, let us design the must have
Manchester face mask that sells

1893
00:53:43.474 --> 00:53:44.682
Manchester face mask that sells
around the world, let us make

1894
00:53:44.682 --> 00:53:46.390
around the world, let us make
something of this, let us make

1895
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:49.182
something of this, let us make
something positive out of it. I feel

1896
00:53:49.182 --> 00:53:50.932
something positive out of it. I feel
that we probably should look at what

1897
00:53:50.932 --> 00:53:52.807
that we probably should look at what
other countries are doing and

1898
00:53:52.807 --> 00:53:54.849
other countries are doing and
encourage the use more, certainly on

1899
00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:55.099
encourage the use more, certainly on
pub“:

1900
00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:56.265
encourage the use more, certainly on
public transport we are saying it is

1901
00:53:56.265 --> 00:53:59.390
public transport we are saying it is
the right thing to do, so that there

1902
00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:01.182
the right thing to do, so that there
is confidence amongst the travelling

1903
00:54:01.182 --> 00:54:01.474
is confidence amongst the travelling
pub“:

1904
00:54:01.474 --> 00:54:02.265
is confidence amongst the travelling
public and no disagreements between

1905
00:54:02.265 --> 00:54:03.557
public and no disagreements between
some people wearing masks and some

1906
00:54:03.557 --> 00:54:05.557
some peopla wearing masks and some
not. Have you

1907
00:54:05.557 --> 00:54:08.557
some people wearing masks and some
not. Have you worn one yet? If they

1908
00:54:08.557 --> 00:54:10.807
not. Have you worn one yet? If they
bring any benefit at all, as I think

1909
00:54:10.807 --> 00:54:13.974
bring any benefit at all, as I think
they do, we should embrace it. Have

1910
00:54:13.974 --> 00:54:17.932
they do, we should embrace it. Have
you worn one? No, but I have not

1911
00:54:17.932 --> 00:54:19.765
you worn one? No, but I have not
been out very much. I have been

1912
00:54:19.765 --> 00:54:20.390
been out very much. I have been
home—based. I would

1913
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.557
been out very much. I have been
home—based. Iwould be

1914
00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:20.932
been out very much. I have been
home—based. I would be more than

1915
00:54:20.932 --> 00:54:21.599
home-based. I would be more than
happy to set

1916
00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:25.515
home—based. I would be more than
happy to set that example. Yeah. It

1917
00:54:25.515 --> 00:54:26.807
happy to set that example. Yeah. It
is about being public spirited as

1918
00:54:26.807 --> 00:54:30.932
is about being public spirited as
james said.

1919
00:54:30.932 --> 00:54:31.474
is about being public spirited as
James said. Originally the

1920
00:54:31.474 --> 00:54:33.140
James said. Originally the
government was suggesting that face

1921
00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.349
government was suggesting that face
coverings were not necessary and

1922
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:37.390
coverings were not necessary and
might actually give a false sense of

1923
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:38.807
might actually give a false sense of
confidence and then the government

1924
00:54:38.807 --> 00:54:40.015
confidence and then the government
decided that when it came to

1925
00:54:40.015 --> 00:54:43.724
decided that when it came to
enclosed spaces such as public

1926
00:54:43.724 --> 00:54:44.765
enclosed spaces such as public
transport that face coverings were

1927
00:54:44.765 --> 00:54:48.849
transport that face coverings were
advised. Seen how many people are

1928
00:54:48.849 --> 00:54:49.807
advised. Seen how many people are
wearing face coverings on public

1929
00:54:49.807 --> 00:54:51.349
wearing face coverings on public
transport at the moment, the report

1930
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:52.807
transport at the moment, the report
seems to be pretty mixed, are you

1931
00:54:52.807 --> 00:54:56.557
seems to be pretty mixed, are you
happy with the way it is going? In

1932
00:54:56.557 --> 00:54:58.640
happy with the way it is going? In
terms of the advice, it will evolve

1933
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.349
terms of the advice, it will evolve
and change over time particularly as

1934
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.640
and change over time particularty as
scientific

1935
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.974
and change over time particularly as
scientific advice gets updated and I

1936
00:55:01.974 --> 00:55:05.474
scientific advice gets updated and I
think people should wear face

1937
00:55:05.474 --> 00:55:07.557
think people should wear face
coverings on public transport, it is

1938
00:55:07.557 --> 00:55:09.015
coverings on public transport, it is
a good idea. Lots of people are

1939
00:55:09.015 --> 00:55:09.390
a good idea. Lots of peopla are
still not

1940
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.307
a good idea. Lots of people are
still not doing it. I would advise

1941
00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:16.474
still not doing it. I would advise
them to art. There is a fair chance

1942
00:55:16.474 --> 00:55:18.599
them to art. There is a fair chance
it will help if they have

1943
00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:19.474
it will help if they have
coronavirus, it will potentially

1944
00:55:19.474 --> 00:55:20.182
coronavims, it will potentially
stop it from

1945
00:55:20.182 --> 00:55:20.807
coronavirus, it will potentially
stop it from transmitting and it

1946
00:55:20.807 --> 00:55:22.182
stop it from transmitting and it
gives people confidence to go onto

1947
00:55:22.182 --> 00:55:22.724
gives people confidence to go onto
pub“:

1948
00:55:22.724 --> 00:55:24.849
gives people confidence to go onto
public transport if they see people,

1949
00:55:24.849 --> 00:55:25.474
public transport if they see peopla,
other peopla

1950
00:55:25.474 --> 00:55:26.640
public transport if they see people,
other people are being careful and

1951
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.057
other peopla are being careful and
it also

1952
00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:29.057
other people are being careful and
it also serves as a kind of prompt,

1953
00:55:29.057 --> 00:55:31.099
it also serves as a kind of prompt,
a reminder, that we are not in life

1954
00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:33.807
a reminder, that we are not in life
as we need to behave different lay,

1955
00:55:33.807 --> 00:55:34.974
as we need to behave different lay,
wash our hands more, be careful,

1956
00:55:34.974 --> 00:55:37.599
wash our hands more, be careful,
stay alart and

1957
00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:38.640
wash our hands more, be careful,
stay alert and the face covering

1958
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.724
stay alert and the face covering
serves as a reminder. On the

1959
00:55:40.724 --> 00:55:42.807
serves as a reminder. On the
specific question about if I was

1960
00:55:42.807 --> 00:55:45.807
specific question about if I was
having a sandwich or being served a

1961
00:55:45.807 --> 00:55:47.224
having a sandwich or being served a
sandwich, I think I would want that

1962
00:55:47.224 --> 00:55:48.390
sandwich, I think I would want that
person to be following the guidance

1963
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:50.765
person to be following the guidance
and wearing a face mask but I think

1964
00:55:50.765 --> 00:55:51.307
and wearing a face mask but I think
you ran still

1965
00:55:51.307 --> 00:55:52.599
and wearing a face mask but I think
you can still smile and the person

1966
00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:52.974
you ran still smile and the person
you are

1967
00:55:52.974 --> 00:55:55.974
you can still smile and the person
you are talking... You cannot see it

1968
00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:56.224
you are talking... You cannot see it
so

1969
00:55:56.224 --> 00:55:56.807
you are talking... You rannot see it
so easily. People

1970
00:55:56.807 --> 00:55:57.849
you are talking... You cannot see it
so easily. People can smile with

1971
00:55:57.849 --> 00:55:58.182
so easily. People ran smile with
their eyes

1972
00:55:58.182 --> 00:55:59.557
so easily. People can smile with
their eyes and it is my properly you

1973
00:55:59.557 --> 00:55:59.974
their eyes and it is my property you
ran tell

1974
00:55:59.974 --> 00:56:01.474
their eyes and it is my properly you
can tell even with a face mask on.

1975
00:56:01.474 --> 00:56:01.849
ran tell even with a face mask on.
At the

1976
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:02.849
can tell even with a face mask on.
At the moment it is a recommendation

1977
00:56:02.849 --> 00:56:05.224
At the moment it is a recommendation
on the part of the government and in

1978
00:56:05.224 --> 00:56:07.724
on the part of the government and in
enclosed spaces, can you see it

1979
00:56:07.724 --> 00:56:07.932
enclosed spaces, ran you see it
going

1980
00:56:07.932 --> 00:56:10.182
enclosed spaces, can you see it
going further? I think we have to be

1981
00:56:10.182 --> 00:56:12.807
going further? I think we have to be
guided by the scientific advice and

1982
00:56:12.807 --> 00:56:13.974
guided by the scientific advice and
if there is compelling evidence that

1983
00:56:13.974 --> 00:56:15.765
if there is compelling evidence that
it should be compulsory in the

1984
00:56:15.765 --> 00:56:16.140
it should be compulsory in the
future, I

1985
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.390
it should be compulsory in the
future, lam

1986
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:17.140
it should be compulsory in the
future, I am sure the government

1987
00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.140
future, I am sure the government
will follow the advice but it must

1988
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.849
will follow the advice but it must
as always be led by the science.

1989
00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:23.265
as always be led by the science.
That applies here as much as it

1990
00:56:23.265 --> 00:56:23.432
That applies here as much as it
appﬁes

1991
00:56:23.432 --> 00:56:25.182
That applies here as much as it
applies in all the other areas we

1992
00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:27.390
applies in all the other areas we
talked about this evening. Who here

1993
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.890
talked about this evening. who here
has worn

1994
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:29.182
talked about this evening. Who here
has worn a face mask or covering so

1995
00:56:29.182 --> 00:56:32.932
has worn a face mask or covering so
far? I haven’t worn one yet but I

1996
00:56:32.932 --> 00:56:38.265
far? I haven’t worn one yet but I
have a friend who has made one for

1997
00:56:38.265 --> 00:56:40.390
have a friend who has made one for
me and my husband. Matching masks!

1998
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:42.349
me and my husband. Matching masks!
For when we go back on the tube and

1999
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:45.224
For when we go back on the tube and
I think I would wear one. I hope

2000
00:56:45.224 --> 00:56:46.682
I think I would wear one. I hope
that mask would match the pyjamas

2001
00:56:46.682 --> 00:56:48.849
that mask would match the pyjamas
that you were supposed to be wearing

2002
00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:50.932
that you were supposed to be wearing
this evening. Camilla did a poll

2003
00:56:50.932 --> 00:56:51.640
this evening. Camilla did a poll
onUne

2004
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.890
this evening. Camilla did a poll
online before she came in asking

2005
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.224
online before she came in asking
what she should wear on the

2006
00:56:55.224 --> 00:56:56.182
what she should wear on the
overwhelming vote was for pyjamas.

2007
00:56:56.182 --> 00:56:59.390
overwhelming vote was for pyjamas.
Look! I don’t have respectable

2008
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.765
Look! I don’t have respectabla
enough

2009
00:56:59.765 --> 00:57:01.182
Look! I don’t have respectable
enough pyjamas, but now the pole has

2010
00:57:01.182 --> 00:57:02.807
enough pyjamas, but now the pole has
happened I think I will invest in

2011
00:57:02.807 --> 00:57:04.599
happened I think I will invest in
proper silk ones. Promise me that

2012
00:57:04.599 --> 00:57:06.640
proper silk ones. Promise me that
when you come back on the programme

2013
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:11.140
when you come back on the programme
you will be in your pyjamas. The

2014
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.557
you will be in your pyjamas. The
nation waits with bated breath. On

2015
00:57:13.557 --> 00:57:16.974
nation waits with bated breath. On
that note, RR is up. Tonight our

2016
00:57:16.974 --> 00:57:18.182
that note, RR is up. Tonight our
questions came from the London area

2017
00:57:18.182 --> 00:57:19.807
questions came from the London area
and next week we are looking for

2018
00:57:19.807 --> 00:57:23.265
and next week we are looking for
questions from people living in or

2019
00:57:23.265 --> 00:57:23.765
questions from peopla living in or
near Glasgow

2020
00:57:23.765 --> 00:57:24.015
questions from people living in or
near Glasgow and then

2021
00:57:24.015 --> 00:57:24.807
questions from people living in or
near Glasgow and then following Mike

2022
00:57:24.807 --> 00:57:25.974
near Glasgow and then following Mike
from Southampton. From next week we

2023
00:57:25.974 --> 00:57:29.390
from Southampton. From next week we
are going to do things a little bit

2024
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:30.474
are going to do things a little bit
differently, we cannot have the

2025
00:57:30.474 --> 00:57:31.682
differently, we cannot have the
normal audience here as we have

2026
00:57:31.682 --> 00:57:35.349
normal audience here as we have
done, but we are going to have a

2027
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:36.557
done, but we are going to have a
virtual audience, all the way

2028
00:57:36.557 --> 00:57:38.807
virtual audience, all the way
through the programme. I am very

2029
00:57:38.807 --> 00:57:40.390
through the programme. I am very
much looking forward to it. We are

2030
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.265
much looking forward to it. We are
looking for 12 people to join in the

Live now as it always is. For now,

2050
00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:08.724
Live now as it always is. For now,
thank you to all of you, my panel

2051
00:58:08.724 --> 00:58:10.682
thank you to all of you, my panel
for coming in, and a thank you for

2052
00:58:10.682 --> 00:58:13.224
for coming in, and a thank you for
joining us from Manchester. Thank

2053
00:58:13.224 --> 00:58:15.224
joining us from Manchester. Thank
you for those of you who joined us

2054
00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:16.807
you for those of you who joined us
live, we are grateful for your

2055
00:58:16.807 --> 00:58:19.099
live, we are grateful for your
questions and for those of you who

2056
00:58:19.099 --> 00:58:20.599
questions and for those of you who
joined in the conversation on social

2057
00:58:20.599 --> 00:58:22.724
joined in the conversation on social
media as well. For this week, from

2058
00:58:22.724 --> 00:58:25.307
media as well. For this week, from
Question Time, goodbye.

2059
00:58:51.265 --> 00:58:55.057
We’ve got to be able to be more open
and more able to talk about stuff.

2060
00:58:55.057 --> 00:58:57.724
Let it out. There’s people out there
that can help you.

2061
00:58:57.724 --> 00:58:59.599
It feels really overwhelming.

2062
00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:00.974
Theyjust can’t cope.

2063
00:59:00.974 --> 00:59:02.724
It felt like I couldn’t
talk to anyone,

2064
00:59:02.724 --> 00:59:04.890
and part of that was because
I was ashamed of being gay.

2065
00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:07.265
I remember thinking,
"I’m just going to end this."

2066
00:59:07.265 --> 00:59:08.599
This is such a hard thing

2067
00:59:08.599 --> 00:59:09.974
to define or even admit.

2068
00:59:09.974 --> 00:59:12.765
Mental health issues
can affect any one of us.

2069
00:59:12.765 --> 00:59:15.599
Talk. That’s half the healing.
We need to talk.

2070
00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:17.140
For a range of programmes

2071
00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.224
to help start your conversation,
go to BBC iPlayer.

2072
00:59:22.807 --> 00:59:25.224
10 unlikely travellers...

2073
00:59:25.224 --> 00:59:26.599
16 countries.

2074
00:59:26.599 --> 00:59:28.557
Let’s go!

2075
00:59:28.557 --> 00:59:30.807
What have we got ourselves into?

2076
00:59:30.807 --> 00:59:33.932
This is no holiday —
it’s the adventure of a lifetime.

2077
00:59:33.932 --> 00:59:35.932
Best mode of transport ever!

2078
00:59:35.932 --> 00:59:38.140
I don’t know if this is terrifying
or fun.

2079
00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:40.599
It’s like therre putting on a show
just for us.

2080
00:59:41.557 --> 00:59:44.390
Probably should have gone
to the toilet before starting.

2081
01:00:12.849 --> 01:00:14.307
Tonight, welcome to...

2082
01:00:14.307 --> 01:00:16.224
0h, am I going to say this right?

2083
01:00:16.224 --> 01:00:19.349
Acropolis Now, because...

2084
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.765
You never told me you were going
to start the programme with a pun.

2085
01:00:22.765 --> 01:00:25.432
You’ve got to continue
now you’ve started.

2086
01:00:25.432 --> 01:00:28.015
The reason I’ve done
it is because we’re going to cross

2087
01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:29.515
now to our colleague,
foreign correspondent

2088
01:00:29.515 --> 01:00:32.099
Quentin Sommerville,
who almost seems to be

2089
01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:33.640
on holiday in Greece.

2090
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.515
How have you managed that?

2091
01:00:35.515 --> 01:00:38.682
It does feel like a bit
of a holiday, actually.

2092
01:00:38.682 --> 01:00:42.307
Normally, I’m a Middle East
correspondent, but I’ve been set

2093
01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:47.224
on hold for so long they said,
how about going to Athens,

2094
01:00:47.224 --> 01:00:50.265
and Ijumped at the chance
to get on a plane again,

2095
01:00:50.265 --> 01:00:53.890
and this is one of the few places
where you can get on a plane,

2096
01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:58.474
because the Greeks are beginning
to try and open up their

2097
01:00:58.474 --> 01:01:00.307
tourism industry again.

2098
01:01:00.307 --> 01:01:03.682
The Acropolis opened
this week to tourists.

2099
01:01:03.682 --> 01:01:05.265
Foreign tourists
can’t come here yet.

2100
01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:09.349
If you arrive, as we did today,
at Athens airport, you get a swab

2101
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:11.265
stuck down your throat.

2102
01:01:11.265 --> 01:01:16.224
Perhaps that’s why I’m a bit hoarse.

2103
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:20.849
GAGGING SOUND.

2104
01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:21.890
Ow!

2105
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.932
Did it hurt?

2106
01:01:23.932 --> 01:01:26.390
That sound was entirely involuntary.

2107
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:27.890
It wasn’t too bad.

2108
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:31.682
So they take that swab,
they analyse it.

2109
01:01:31.682 --> 01:01:34.932
For 2A hours, we’re stuck
in a government hotel

2110
01:01:34.932 --> 01:01:37.099
and we can’t leave —
we’re under quarantine.

2111
01:01:37.099 --> 01:01:40.765
If we leave, it’s a 5,000
euros fine, which the BBC

2112
01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:43.640
wouldn’t be happy about,
so we’re stuck here tonight.

2113
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.765
We get the results tomorrow.

2114
01:01:45.765 --> 01:01:49.390
Normally, what happens
if you’re arriving in Greece,

2115
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:52.515
you then have to do a two—week
quarantine regardless

2116
01:01:52.515 --> 01:01:56.724
of whether you’re positive
or negative, but what the Greeks

2117
01:01:56.724 --> 01:02:01.349
are going to do in a few weeks’
time, from June the 15th is they’re

2118
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:06.349
going to get rid of that quarantine
and allow people from many countries

2119
01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:10.807
to return here as holiday—makers.

2120
01:02:10.807 --> 01:02:13.765
Will that include British
people, as things stand?

2121
01:02:13.765 --> 01:02:18.724
That’s the million—dollar question.

2122
01:02:20.224 --> 01:02:24.390
As of right now, it will not
include British people,

2123
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:27.349
but anyway they’ve got another A0
days before they actually

2124
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:29.765
open the borders and get
rid of those tests.

2125
01:02:29.765 --> 01:02:33.015
It’s going to beJuly
the lst when all flights

2126
01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:36.599
across Greece will be reinstated,
so still quite a bit of time,

2127
01:02:36.599 --> 01:02:39.224
and what the Greek authorities have
been saying is this isn’t

2128
01:02:39.224 --> 01:02:43.765
about a particular country,
it’s about the science.

2129
01:02:43.765 --> 01:02:47.765
If a country has a very
high infection rate,

2130
01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:51.140
their citizens will not be able
to come here as tourists.

2131
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.807
It will be dependent on the science.

2132
01:02:53.807 --> 01:02:56.224
I have a feeling, later on,
we’ll be finding out

2133
01:02:56.224 --> 01:02:59.557
if there is such a thing
as "the science" from a special

2134
01:02:59.557 --> 01:03:04.599
scientific guest, who’s a member
of a special scientific body.

2135
01:03:04.765 --> 01:03:07.140
Stay tuned for that and lots
more in this episode

2136
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.015
of the Coronavirus Newscast.

2137
01:03:09.015 --> 01:03:12.640
The Coronavirus Newscast
from the BBC.

2138
01:03:17.557 --> 01:03:19.182
Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

2139
01:03:19.182 --> 01:03:23.015
And it’s Laura, also
in the studio, two metres apart.

2140
01:03:23.015 --> 01:03:25.515
We’re going to go straight
to the Downing Street briefing.

2141
01:03:25.515 --> 01:03:26.932
Of course.

2142
01:03:26.932 --> 01:03:29.599
But hang on, it’s the version
of the Downing Street briefing

2143
01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:32.557
by the comedy duo Larry and Paul.

2144
01:03:32.557 --> 01:03:37.182
Unadvisedly dipping my toe
into the science and saying

2145
01:03:37.182 --> 01:03:40.140
something I don’t understand
about R, perhaps, and

2146
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.515
immediately regretting it...

2147
01:03:41.515 --> 01:03:45.890
Explaining what the R value is,
wishing they taught statistics

2148
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:49.890
properly at school, trying
to explain it again,

2149
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:52.640
realising the futility
and just giving up...

2150
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.015
Pretending that’s what Ijust said.

2151
01:03:55.182 --> 01:03:56.224
Obviously, it’s a pastiche.

2152
01:03:56.224 --> 01:03:58.057
Obviously.

2153
01:03:58.057 --> 01:04:00.682
But quite accurate in some aspects.

2154
01:04:00.682 --> 01:04:04.140
I have no view on the conduct of any
members of the press,

2155
01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.765
any other members of the press.

2156
01:04:06.765 --> 01:04:10.599
I would never express a view other
than to say solidarity

2157
01:04:10.599 --> 01:04:13.015
with all myjournalistic colleagues
who are working very hard

2158
01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.265
in challenging circumstances.

2159
01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:17.890
Fergus Walsh has been keeping an eye
on various medical issues.

2160
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.765
Lots of that today.

2161
01:04:19.765 --> 01:04:23.932
Fergus, where are you and what
have you been doing?

2162
01:04:23.932 --> 01:04:28.390
I’m at the top of a very big hill
that I sometimes cycle up.

2163
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.974
Fortunately, I’m not wearing
what I would normally

2164
01:04:30.974 --> 01:04:32.807
wear when I’m cycling.

2165
01:04:32.807 --> 01:04:35.765
Are you looking for the vaccine?

2166
01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:36.807
I’m moving the vaccine.

2167
01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:38.890
A lot of news that.

2168
01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:43.890
AstraZeneca, huge multinational drug
company, said today that it reckons

2169
01:04:45.224 --> 01:04:49.890
it can do a billion doses —
that’s 1,000 million doses —

2170
01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:54.265
of the Oxford vaccine,
big caveat, if it works,

2171
01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:59.307
by the end of next year,
and today was four weeks

2172
01:05:00.432 --> 01:05:04.932
since the first volunteers
were immunised, so the team will be

2173
01:05:04.932 --> 01:05:09.515
looking for antibodies,
but I have to say there’s one big

2174
01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:14.557
problem surrounding all of this,
which is that those volunteers need

2175
01:05:14.807 --> 01:05:18.224
to go out and meet the virus
in their daily lives,
