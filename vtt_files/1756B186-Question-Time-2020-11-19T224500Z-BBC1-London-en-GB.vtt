00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:33.453
I’m culturally overwhelmed.

They are the stuff of dreams,
aren’t they?

These are the culmination
of brilliant brains,

science and design.

related to Priti Patel’s reported
billing of

120
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.245
related to Priti Patel’s reported
billing of civil servants, if she is

billing of civil servants, if she is
found to have broken the ministerial

122
00:04:50.578 --> 00:04:54.370
found to have broken the ministerial
code, should she go? A story which

123
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.120
code, should she go? A story which
broke earlier this evening. Emily.

124

broke eartier this evening. Emily.
What

125
00:04:59.287 --> 00:04:59.412
broke eartier this evening. Emily.
what we

126
00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:00.912
broke earlier this evening. Emily.
What we have heard is that Boris

127
00:05:00.912 --> 00:05:01.245
what we have heard is that Boris
johnson is

128
00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:01.537
What we have heard is that Boris
Johnson is basically

129
00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:02.037
What we have heard is that Boris
Johnson is basicallyjust going to

130
00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:02.912
johnson is basically just going to
give her a rap

131
00:05:02.912 --> 00:05:03.703
Johnson is basicallyjust going to
give her a rap over the knuckles. I

132
00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:06.412
give her a rap over the knuckles. I
think we need to see the report. The

133
00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:09.662
think we need to see the report. The
allocations that I have heard our

134
00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:10.287
allocations that I have heard our
lyric, to say

135
00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:11.162
allocations that I have heard our
lyrics, to say the least. I think

136
00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:13.037
lyric, to say the least. I think
it’s an

137
00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:13.787
lyrics, to say the least. I think
it’s an extreme example of billing

138
00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:15.328
it’s an extreme example of billing
in the workplace, and I think people

139
00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:15.662
in the workplace, and I think peopla
should be

140
00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:19.995
in the workplace, and I think people
should be measured by the same

141
00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:21.370
should be measured by the same
measure, so, if Priti Patel had been

142
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.078
measure, so, if Priti Patel had been
a senior civil servant, how would

143
00:05:23.078 --> 00:05:25.953
a senior civil servant, how would
she have been treated? I think we

144
00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:28.412
she have been treated? I think we
should treat a minister in the same

145
00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.078
should treat a minister in the same
way, and I think it is a serious

146
00:05:30.078 --> 00:05:31.787
way, and I think it is a serious
lapse of

147
00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:32.620
way, and I think it is a serious
lapse ofjudgment by the Prime

148
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.912
lapse ofjudgment by the Prime
Minister to simply rap over the

149
00:05:33.912 --> 00:05:36.162
Minister to simply rap over the
knuckles. We don’t yet know that is

150
00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:40.745
knuckles. We don’t yet know that is
what he is going to do. That’s what

151
00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:41.953
what he is going to do. That’s what
I heard. If he doesn’t, that’s

152
00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:44.870
I heard. If he doesn’t, that’s
fine... Cue do you think Priti Patel

153
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.453
fine... Cue do you think Priti Patel
should lose her

154
00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:48.745
fine... Cue do you think Priti Patel
should lose herjob? of step one, we

155
00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:49.245
should lose her job? of step one, we
should see

156
00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:50.370
should lose herjob? of step one, we
should see the full report and get

157
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.662
should see the full report and get
her to come to Parliament and answer

158
00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:52.078
her to come to Partiament and answer
on her

159
00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:55.203
her to come to Parliament and answer
on her behaviour. From what one

160
00:05:55.203 --> 00:05:57.120
on her behaviour. From what one
hears, this is very serious and the

161
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120
hears, this is very serious and the
government is not taking it

162
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.787
government is not taking it
sufficiently seriously. These

163
00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:04.120
sufficiently seriously. These
allegations were made in February.

164
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.412
allegations were made in February.

most senior civil servant in the

Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, who
was suing for unfair dismissal, he’s

168
00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.995
was suing for unfair dismissal, he’s
talked about allegations of shouting

169
00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:14.870
talked about allegations of shouting
and swearing, belittling people,

and swearing, belittling peopla,
making

171
00:06:15.037 --> 00:06:15.745
and swearing, belittling people,
making unreasonable demands,

172
00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:19.162
making unreasonable demands,
behaviour creating fear, and it

173
00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:20.912
behaviour creating fear, and it
needed some bravery to pull out.

174
00:06:20.912 --> 00:06:23.912
needed some bravery to pull out.
This is what he accuses Home

175
00:06:23.912 --> 00:06:25.203
This is what he accuses Home
Secretary Priti Patel of doing. She

176
00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:30.037
Secretary Priti Patel of doing. She
has a was denied it. There is a

177
00:06:30.037 --> 00:06:31.203
has a was denied it. There is a
report on BBC Newsnight tonight and

178
00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:33.370
report on BBC Newsnight tonight and
other places saying that the draft

179
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.703
other places saying that the draft
report suggests that evidence of

180
00:06:36.703 --> 00:06:38.203
report suggests that evidence of
bullying has been found by Priti

181
00:06:38.203 --> 00:06:45.037
bullying has been found by Priti
Patel. James. Well, I haven’t seen

182
00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.037
Patel. james. Well, I haven’t seen
the report, and I

183
00:06:46.037 --> 00:06:46.412
Patel. James. Well, I haven’t seen
the report, and I am incredibly

184
00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:47.287
the report, and I am incredibly
uncomfortable speculating about the

185
00:06:47.287 --> 00:06:53.453
uncomfortable speculating about the
content of a report that I haven’t

186
00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:54.453
content of a report that I haven’t
seen or pontificating about what

187
00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:54.578
seen or pontifirating about what
actions

188
00:06:54.578 --> 00:06:57.745
seen or pontificating about what
actions might be taken from that. I

189
00:06:57.745 --> 00:07:00.203
actions might be taken from that. I
know Priti Patel very well. She is a

190
00:07:00.203 --> 00:07:01.495
know Priti Patel very well. She is a
neighbouring MP of mine, and I have

191
00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:03.620
neighbouring MP of mine, and I have
known her long before either she or

192
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.745
known her long before either she or
I became MPs. And I think that my

193
00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:11.703
I became MPs. And I think that my
observation of her is that she has

194
00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:12.578
observation of her is that she has
always expected and demanded that

195
00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:18.370
always expected and demanded that
people work hard, and I think that

196
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.953
peopla work hard, and I think that
that is a

197
00:07:19.953 --> 00:07:20.328
people work hard, and I think that
that is a completely legitimate

198
00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:21.578
that is a completely legitimate
attitude to take into government.

199
00:07:21.578 --> 00:07:24.453
attitude to take into government.
The Home Office particularly as the

200
00:07:24.453 --> 00:07:24.578
The Home Office particularty as the
department

201
00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:27.203
The Home Office particularly as the
department that keeps us safe. It

202
00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:29.203
department that keeps us safe. It
has to deal with some incredibly

203
00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:30.537
has to deal with some incredibly
important and sensitive issues, and

204
00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:33.578
important and sensitive issues, and
that does mean that people need to

205
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.328
that does mean that people need to
be decisive, people need to be

206
00:07:35.328 --> 00:07:36.412
be decisive, people need to be
hard—working, and it is the

207
00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:36.578
be decisive, people need to be
hard—working, and it is thejob

208
00:07:36.578 --> 00:07:36.828
be decisive, people need to be
hard—working, and it is the job of

209
00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:36.995
hard-working, and it is the job of
ministers

210
00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:38.245
hard—working, and it is the job of
ministers to make sure departments

211
00:07:38.245 --> 00:07:43.953
ministers to make sure departments
function at their optimal output.

212
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.287
function at their optimal output.
Not by bullying people. You don’t

peopla,

216
00:07:48.412 --> 00:07:51.037
get optimal output by bullying
people, do you? Edge I took across

217
00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:51.120
peopla, do you? Edge I took across
them,

218
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.203
people, do you? Edge I took across
them, perhaps? You don’t do it by

219
00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:55.870
them, perhaps? You don’t do it by
billing peopla,

220
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.620
them, perhaps? You don’t do it by
billing people, do you know that. If

221
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:57.953
billing peopla, do you know that. If
she has

222
00:07:57.953 --> 00:07:58.870
billing people, do you know that. If
she has been bullying people, don’t

223
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.078
she has been bullying people, don’t
you think she should go? As I say,

224
00:08:02.078 --> 00:08:03.495
you think she should go? As I say,
I’m not going to speculate on a

225
00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:05.370
I’m not going to speculate on a
report I haven’t read. There seems

226
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.870
report I haven’t read. There seems
to be some suggestion that this,

227
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.245
to be some suggestion that this,
that, if she was bullying, it was

228
00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:14.203
that, if she was bullying, it was
not intentional, and therefore that

229
00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.203
not intentional, and therefore that
might make it less of a problem.

230
00:08:16.203 --> 00:08:16.412
might make it lass of a problem.
Does

231
00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:21.620
might make it less of a problem.
Does that hold water? Well, I don’t

232
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.203
Does that hold water? Well, I don’t
want to sound like a broken record,

233
00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:24.703
want to sound like a broken record,
you are asking me to spectate on a

234
00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:28.662
you are asking me to spectate on a
report that I haven’t seen. On what

235
00:08:28.662 --> 00:08:29.870
report that I haven’t seen. On what
is an important and sensitive issue,

236
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.078
is an important and sensitive issue,
and that is why I am uncomfortable

237
00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.245
and that is why I am uncomfortable
doing so, but it is the

238
00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:33.662
and that is why I am uncomfortable
doing so, but it is thejob of

239
00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:35.745
doing so, but it is thejob of
ministers to make sure that

240
00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:39.287
ministers to make sure that
departments deliver. Chemical I

241
00:08:39.287 --> 00:08:40.453
departments deliver. Chemical I
don’t think anyone is doubting that.

242
00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:44.203
don’t think anyone is doubting that.
It’s just the way one goes about it.

243
00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:46.328
It’s just the way one goes about it.
These departments are delivering for

244
00:08:46.328 --> 00:08:47.870
These departments are delivering for
the British people, and it is a

245
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.078
the British people, and it is a
minister’s

246
00:08:48.078 --> 00:08:48.662
the British people, and it is a
minister’sjob to make

247
00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:49.328
the British people, and it is a
minister’s job to make sure they do

248
00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:54.495
minister’s job to make sure they do
so. There is never any excuse for

249
00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:55.453
so. There is never any excuse for
not treating people with respect,

250
00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:58.953
not treating people with respect,
but then again ministers do need to

251
00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:00.078
but then again ministers do need to
demand pretty high standards on

252
00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:01.578
demand pretty high standards on
behalf of the voters, who sent them

253
00:09:01.578 --> 00:09:05.162
behalf of the voters, who sent them
into office. In the Home Office

254
00:09:05.162 --> 00:09:06.412
into office. In the Home Office
especially, there will be lots of

255
00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.203
especially, there will be lots of
very difficult conversations. The

256
00:09:08.203 --> 00:09:10.662
very difficult conversations. The
big question is where you draw the

257
00:09:10.662 --> 00:09:11.495
big question is where you draw the
line between a difficult

258
00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:12.620
line between a difficult
conversation in saying this isn’t

259
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.453
conversation in saying this isn’t
good enough, I expect you to do

260
00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.412
good enough, I expect you to do
better, if that’s what she did, and

261
00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:18.328
better, if that’s what she did, and
bullying. It’s pretty difficult to

262
00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:19.620
bullying. It’s pretty difficult to
know that because we have no idea

263
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.453
know that because we have no idea
what is in the report. The leak of

264
00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:26.203
what is in the report. The leak of
it, as far as we know, says that she

265
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:27.287
it, as far as we know, says that she
broke some protocol but not

266
00:09:27.287 --> 00:09:28.078
broke some protocol but not
necessarily broke the ministerial

267
00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:30.787
necessarily broke the ministerial
code. We will have to wait to see.

268
00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:32.453
code. We will have to wait to see.
If it was a major breach of the

269
00:09:32.453 --> 00:09:35.453
If it was a major breach of the
ministerial code, you can expert her

270
00:09:35.453 --> 00:09:36.245
ministerial code, you ran expert her
to go in Boris

271
00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:36.620
ministerial code, you can expert her
to go in BorisJohnson’s next

272
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.287
to go in BorisJohnson’s next
reshuffle. From the start of this,

273
00:09:40.287 --> 00:09:40.412
reshufﬂe. From the start of this,
there

274
00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:41.203
reshuffle. From the start of this,
there have been lots of

275
00:09:41.203 --> 00:09:42.287
there have been lots of
contradictory reports about what she

276
00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:43.662
contradictory reports about what she
did and didn’t do, whether she was

277
00:09:43.662 --> 00:09:47.412
did and didn’t do, whether she was
simply demanding that her department

278
00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:48.578
simply demanding that her department
live up to the expectations that

279
00:09:48.578 --> 00:09:50.620
live up to the expectations that
voters set or whether she did go

280
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.537
voters set or whether she did go
over the line. I guess it won’t be

281
00:09:53.537 --> 00:09:56.703
over the line. I guess it won’t be
long before we find out. Lets hear

282
00:09:56.703 --> 00:10:00.495
long before we find out. Lets hear
what you have got to say. Marina. It

283
00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:00.995
what you have got to say. Marina. It
is Anti-Bullying

284
00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:01.745
what you have got to say. Marina. It
is Anti—Bullying Week and we are

285
00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:02.412
is Anti-Bullying Week and we are
trying to

286
00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:05.703
is Anti—Bullying Week and we are
trying to educate leadership to our

287
00:10:05.703 --> 00:10:06.870
trying to educate leadership to our
children to reduce bullying, so it’s

288
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.995
children to reduce bullying, so it’s
really disappointing to hear

289
00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:13.370
children to reduce bullying, so it’s
really disappointing to hearJames

290
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.953
really disappointing to hear james
issue

291
00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:17.453
really disappointing to hearJames
issue that assertive behaviour that

292
00:10:17.453 --> 00:10:18.620
issue that assertive behaviour that
strays into billing is acceptable in

293
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.537
strays into billing is acceptable in
any leadership position for them

294
00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:22.703
any leadership position for them
they should be zero tolerance of

295
00:10:22.703 --> 00:10:22.995
they should be zero tolarance of
this

296
00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:26.370
they should be zero tolerance of
this behaviour. In fairness, I don’t

297
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.578
this behaviour. In fairness, I don’t
think you were saying... We haven’t

298
00:10:28.578 --> 00:10:30.287
think you were saying... We haven’t
seen the report and I think it is

299
00:10:30.287 --> 00:10:33.037
seen the report and I think it is
deeply unfair, starting to pass

300
00:10:33.037 --> 00:10:39.495
deeply unfair, starting to pass
judgment on somebody who takes the

301
00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:40.620
judgment on somebody who takes the
protection of our nation and the

302
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.162
protection of our nation and the
peopla

303
00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:41.745
protection of our nation and the
people within it incredibly

304
00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:49.120
people within it incredibly
seriously. Caroline. I

305
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.245
people within it incredibly
seriously. Caroline. Ijust echo

306
00:10:50.245 --> 00:10:52.287
seriously. Caroline. Ijust echo
what Marina says, and absolutely I

307
00:10:52.287 --> 00:10:53.912
what Marina says, and absolutely I
agree with James, this is all

308
00:10:53.912 --> 00:10:55.120
agree with James, this is all
speculation, but if the report does

309
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.328
speculation, but if the report does
say that she has been displaying

310
00:10:58.328 --> 00:10:59.078
say that she has been displaying
bullying behaviour, absolutely I

311
00:10:59.078 --> 00:11:02.870
bullying behaviour, absolutely I
think she should go. She is in such

312
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.662
think she should go. She is in such
a senior position and, as Marina

313
00:11:04.662 --> 00:11:06.287
a senior position and, as Marina
said, she is a senior person and

314

this is not a role model we want.

315
00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:10.620
this is not a rola model we want.
You ran

316
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.328
this is not a role model we want.
You can have a decisive,

317

You can have a decisive,
industrious, hard working without it

318
00:11:12.328 --> 00:11:16.412
industrious, hard working without it
being bullying. This is a question

319
00:11:16.412 --> 00:11:17.620
being bullying. This is a question
to the whole panel, but specifically

320
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.287
to the whole panel, but specifically
james. If

321
00:11:19.287 --> 00:11:20.662
to the whole panel, but specifically
James. If there were allegations of

00:11:20.662 --> 00:11:21.037
james. If there were allegations of
bullying that

323
00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:21.870
James. If there were allegations of
bullying that you found in your

324
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.037
bullying that you found in your
staff, what would you do about it

325
00:11:25.037 --> 00:11:27.037
staff, what would you do about it
personally I am just going to go a

326
00:11:27.037 --> 00:11:29.620
personally I am just going to go a
bit further, if I made. Ruth.

327
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.203
bit further, ifI made. Ruth.
Listening to

328
00:11:30.203 --> 00:11:33.245
bit further, if I made. Ruth.
Listening to James, I think what

329
00:11:33.245 --> 00:11:33.578
Listening to james, I think what
happened to

330
00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:34.245
Listening to James, I think what
happened to being innocent until

331
00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:36.453
happened to being innocent until
proven guilty, given that nobody has

332
00:11:36.453 --> 00:11:41.662
proven guilty, given that nobody has
had sight of this report it stop not

333
00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:43.078
had sight of this report it stop not
only has nobody seen this report but

334
00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.245
only has nobody seen this report but
Priti Patel is strongly denied she

335
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.745
Priti Patel is strongly denied she
had bullied anybody for the let’s

336
00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:50.245
had bullied anybody for the let’s
deal with the principles of this

337
00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:51.662
deal with the principles of this
because, in the last Parliament,

338
00:11:51.662 --> 00:11:52.037
because, in the last Partiament,
Theresa May

339
00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:52.620
because, in the last Parliament,
Theresa May brought all party

340
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.203
Theresa May brought all party
leaders together to make sure that

341
00:11:56.203 --> 00:11:57.245
leaders together to make sure that
Parliament was taking its

342
00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:57.953
Parliament was taking its
responsibilities over bullying and

343
00:11:57.953 --> 00:11:59.828
responsibilities over bullying and
sexual misconduct, and we have to

344
00:11:59.828 --> 00:12:00.203
sexual misconduct, and we have to
[ad by

345
00:12:00.203 --> 00:12:02.870
sexual misconduct, and we have to
lead by example. We have to show

346
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.203
lead by example. We have to show
leadership and we have to make it

347
00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:05.620
leadership and we have to make it
very dear

348
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.453
leadership and we have to make it
very clear that those that work in

349
00:12:08.453 --> 00:12:08.578
very clear that those that work in
Partiament,

350
00:12:08.578 --> 00:12:09.287
very clear that those that work in
Parliament, those that work

351
00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:10.287
Parliament, those that work
elsewhere in society needs the

352
00:12:10.287 --> 00:12:11.453
elsewhere in society needs the
fullest protection from this kind of

353
00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:14.578
fullest protection from this kind of
thing. And I think there has to be a

354
00:12:14.578 --> 00:12:19.037
thing. And I think there has to be a
certain amount of honour in all of

355
00:12:19.037 --> 00:12:20.412
certain amount of honour in all of
us in making sure that we discharge

356
00:12:20.412 --> 00:12:21.620
us in making sure that we discharge
our response abilities in the right

357
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.162
our response abilities in the right
way. We can’t take judgment

358
00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.370
way. We can’t take judgment
ourselves tonight on Priti Patel

359
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.162
ourselves tonight on Priti Patel
because we haven’t seen the report,

360
00:12:28.162 --> 00:12:29.537
because we haven’t seen the report,
and I think Emily is right, this

361
00:12:29.537 --> 00:12:31.828
and I think Emily is right, this
report should be published. I think

362
00:12:31.828 --> 00:12:33.412
report should be published. I think
it is in the public interest that it

363
00:12:33.412 --> 00:12:38.370
it is in the public interest that it
is. If it is the case that there is

364
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:38.995
is. If it is the rase that there is
a serious

365
00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:39.870
is. If it is the case that there is
a serious breach of the ministerial

366
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.578
a serious breach of the ministerial
code, there ought to be consequences

367
00:12:41.578 --> 00:12:44.287
code, there ought to be consequences
but, I have to say, if that is the

368
00:12:44.287 --> 00:12:44.620
but, I have to say, if that is the
use, what

369
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.745
but, I have to say, if that is the
case, what should happen in the

370
00:12:45.745 --> 00:12:45.995
rase, what should happen in the
first

371
00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:47.495
case, what should happen in the
first instance is that anybody who

372
00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.578
first instance is that anybody who
is guilty of a serious breach of the

373
00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:51.870
is guilty of a serious breach of the
ministerial code should not wait to

374
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.620
ministerial code should not wait to
be sacked, they should take their

375
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.412
be sacked, they should take their
responsibility and they should

376
00:12:54.412 --> 00:12:56.328
responsibility and they should
resign, because that is the way we

377
00:12:56.328 --> 00:12:58.578
resign, because that is the way we
used to do things in public life in

378
00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:00.078
used to do things in public life in
this country, that is the kind of

379
00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:02.412
this country, that is the kind of
standard we should be held to.

380
00:13:02.412 --> 00:13:06.245
standard we should be held to.
Interesting from your perspective,

381
00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:07.412
Interesting from your perspective,
given that you were chaplain at

382
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.912
given that you were chaplain at
Westminster. I’ve only

383
00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:10.537
given that you were chaplain at
Westminster. I’ve onlyjust heard

384
00:13:10.537 --> 00:13:11.870
Westminster. I’ve only just heard
about this, I

385
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.870
Westminster. I’ve onlyjust heard
about this, I think I would want to

386
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.495
about this, I think I would want to
see the report and to hear what is

387
00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.412
see the report and to hear what is
being said, she is being accused of,

388
00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:21.620
being said, she is being accused of,
and also what the report itself has

389
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.037
and also what the report itself has
thrown up, and for due process to

390
00:13:23.037 --> 00:13:26.578
thrown up, and for due process to
take place. I believe passionately

391
00:13:26.578 --> 00:13:30.203
take place. I believe passionately
that bullying of any form is

392
00:13:30.203 --> 00:13:36.037
that bullying of any form is
unacceptable, and so we must wait.

393
00:13:36.037 --> 00:13:37.412
unacceptable, and so we must wait.
Let’s not be rushed to make a

394
00:13:37.412 --> 00:13:37.787
Let’s not be mshed to make a
judgment at

395
00:13:37.787 --> 00:13:38.787
Let’s not be rushed to make a
judgment at this time. Let’s wait

396
00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:41.787
judgment at this time. Let’s wait
and see and hope that due process

397
00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:41.953
judgment at this time. Let’s wait
and see and hope that due process

398
00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:45.578
and see and hope that due process
will be followed. I am going

will be followed. I am going to take

00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:20.245
you, because of yourjob, and
Christmas is a critical time of year

469
00:15:20.245 --> 00:15:22.620
Christmas is a critical time of year
for those that follow the Christian

470
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.787
for those that follow the Christian
tradition in this country, but this

471
00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:25.328
tradition in this country, but this
year, should people accept perhaps

472
00:15:25.328 --> 00:15:29.245
year, should people accept perhaps
they can’t be together? It’s quite

473
00:15:29.245 --> 00:15:30.412
they can’t be together? It’s quite
possible because of the pandemic

474
00:15:30.412 --> 00:15:32.412
possible because of the pandemic
that we will not be able to

475
00:15:32.412 --> 00:15:33.995
that we will not be able to
celebrate Christmas in the way we

476
00:15:33.995 --> 00:15:35.662
celebrate Christmas in the way we
have always celebrated it. I think

477
00:15:35.662 --> 00:15:35.828
have always celabrated it. I think
we

478
00:15:35.828 --> 00:15:36.620
have always celebrated it. I think
we shouldn’t be waiting for

479
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.870
we shouldn’t be waiting for
government to make laws about this.

480
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.245
government to make laws about this.
I think we, as a community, should

481
00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:46.662
I think we, as a community, should
act responsibly. What does that

482
00:15:46.662 --> 00:15:47.037
act responsibly. what does that
mean, not

483
00:15:47.037 --> 00:15:47.662
act responsibly. What does that
mean, not having grandpa Auchrannie

484
00:15:47.662 --> 00:15:50.787
mean, not having grandpa Auchrannie
over? It means we need to behave in

485
00:15:50.787 --> 00:15:52.620
over? It means we need to behave in
a way that is going to protect those

486
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.037
a way that is going to protect those
who are most vulnerable. My family

487
00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:56.245
who are most vulnerable. My family
are scattered all over the country

488
00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:57.578
are scattered all over the country
and I would desperately love to have

489
00:15:57.578 --> 00:15:59.995
and I would desperately love to have
my wonderful, gorgeous grandchildren

490
00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:02.953
my wonderful, gorgeous grandchildren
with me, but it might not happen,

491
00:16:02.953 --> 00:16:05.037
with me, but it might not happen,
and I think we need to be patient

492
00:16:05.037 --> 00:16:07.995
and I think we need to be patient
and accept our reality for what it

493
00:16:07.995 --> 00:16:11.828
and accept our reality for what it
is and make sure that we protect

494
00:16:11.828 --> 00:16:13.745
is and make sure that we protect
those who are most vulnerable. Right

495
00:16:13.745 --> 00:16:17.412
those who are most vulnerable. Right
now, in Swale and Thanet, the

496
00:16:17.412 --> 00:16:22.412
now, in Swale and Thanet, the
infection rate is over 600 and 500.

497
00:16:22.412 --> 00:16:27.037
infection rate is over 600 and 500.
That is exceptionally high. In the

498
00:16:27.037 --> 00:16:28.037
That is exceptionally high. In the
church, we have worked with

499
00:16:28.037 --> 00:16:31.620
church, we have worked with
government to ensure that protection

500
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.787
government to ensure that protection
of those most vulnerable. We have

501
00:16:32.787 --> 00:16:34.203
of those most vulnerable. We have
also worked to ensure that our

502
00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:39.037
also worked to ensure that our
churches are Covid safe, we are not

503
00:16:39.037 --> 00:16:40.328
churches are Covid safe, we are not
gathering in large groups, and it’s

504
00:16:40.328 --> 00:16:42.745
gathering in large groups, and it’s
not just about the church. There

505
00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:42.912
gathering in large groups, and it’s
notjust about the church. There are

506
00:16:42.912 --> 00:16:43.620
not just about the church. There are
those who

507
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.662
notjust about the church. There are
those who are interfaith brothers

508
00:16:44.662 --> 00:16:52.370
those who are interfaith brothers
and sisters. Eid, a big festival,

509
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.787
and sisters. Eid, a big festival,
Diwali, and I don’t know what will

510
00:16:53.787 --> 00:16:57.078
Diwali, and I don’t know what will
happen with Hannukah, so we are in

511
00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:58.203
happen with Hannukah, so we are in
it together. Let’s just be patient

512
00:16:58.203 --> 00:17:01.953
it together. Let’s just be patient
and let’s do the right thing. Let’s

513
00:17:01.953 --> 00:17:02.495
and let’s do the right thing. Let’s
hear from our

519
00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:11.495
totally agree with Rose, thank you
for saying that. A lot of local

520
00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:12.703
for saying that. A lot of local
businesses have put so much

521
00:17:12.703 --> 00:17:14.495
businesses have put so much
investment into becoming Covid safe,

522
00:17:14.495 --> 00:17:17.703
investment into becoming Covid safe,
just to have that whipped away at

523
00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.995
just to have that whipped away at
the last moment, just before

524
00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:19.953
the last moment, just before
Christmas, just getting some money

back. lam hearing that, ifwe have
these five days

531
00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:23.370
back. I am hearing that, if we have
these five days around Christmas,

532
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:27.037
these five days around Christmas,
there are going to be 25 days of

533
00:17:27.037 --> 00:17:28.578
there are going to be 25 days of
lockdown in January for the where

534
00:17:28.578 --> 00:17:28.828
there are going to be 25 days of
lockdown inJanuary for the where is

535
00:17:28.828 --> 00:17:29.412
lockdown in january for the where is
the logic in

536
00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:30.537
lockdown inJanuary for the where is
the logic in that? I don’t

537
00:17:30.537 --> 00:17:32.078
the logic in that? I don’t
understand it. I

538
00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:32.245
the logic in that? I don’t
understand it. Iwant

539
00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:37.870
the logic in that? I don’t
understand it. I want to know how we

540
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.078
understand it. I want to know how we
help the business that have invested

541
00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:40.828
help the business that have invested
so much money into making sure their

542
00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:44.745
so much money into making sure their
businesses are safe, and to Rose’s

543
00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:45.912
businesses are safe, and to Rose’s
point, it is down to personal

544
00:17:45.912 --> 00:17:48.412
point, it is down to personal
responsibility for the why do we

545
00:17:48.412 --> 00:17:49.037
responsibility for the why do we
need Boris Johnson

546
00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:50.412
responsibility for the why do we
need BorisJohnson to tell us how we

547
00:17:50.412 --> 00:17:50.620
need Boris johnson to tell us how we
should

548
00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.578
need BorisJohnson to tell us how we
should live our daily life? It’s

549
00:17:51.578 --> 00:17:53.370
should live our daily life? It’s
down to us as individuals. To

550
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.203
down to us as individuals. To
protect ourselves and others. There

551
00:17:56.203 --> 00:18:01.328
protect ourselves and others. There
are many of us who, around Eid,

552
00:18:01.328 --> 00:18:02.495
are many of us who, around Eid,
could not get together with loved

553
00:18:02.495 --> 00:18:05.787
could not get together with loved
ones. We made it work and used Zoom

554
00:18:05.787 --> 00:18:06.453
ones. We made it work and used Zoom
and other facilities.

555
00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:07.078
ones. We made it work and used Zoom
and otherfacilities. You have to

556
00:18:07.078 --> 00:18:07.578
and other facilities. You have to
make it

557
00:18:07.578 --> 00:18:10.412
and otherfacilities. You have to
make it work and be sensible. Thank

558
00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:14.245
make it work and be sensible. Thank
Martin. Would it not be more

559
00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:15.537
Martin. Would it not be more
appropriate for people to meet in

560
00:18:15.537 --> 00:18:16.870
appropriate for people to meet in
their own homes rather than meeting

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.203
their own homes rather than meeting

569
00:18:29.245 --> 00:18:30.828
supermarkets either put up Elliott,
should the government allow people

570
00:18:30.828 --> 00:18:32.245
should the government allow people
to meet up over Christmas if people

571
00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:32.620
to meet up over Christmas if peopla
are going

572
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.412
to meet up over Christmas if people
are going break the rules anyway

573
00:18:34.412 --> 00:18:36.662

because of nature of hands, quite a

because of nature of hands, quite a

few people are thinking, well, I am
just going to get my family over

577
00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:41.495
just going to get my family over
whatever. That has to be part of the

578
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:42.412
whatever. That has to be part of the
compilation for the government,

579
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:46.245
compilation for the government,
doesn’t it?

580
00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:46.412
I’v
e

581
00:18:46.412 --> 00:18:52.245
I’ve been really impressed, not so
much surprised, but really impressed

582
00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:54.870
much surprised, but really impressed
by how, for the most part, people

583
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.120
by how, for the most part, peopla
have

584
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.328
by how, for the most part, people
have been careful and thoughtful and

585
00:18:57.328 --> 00:18:58.120
have been careful and thoughtful and
have taken

586
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.620
have been careful and thoughtful and
have ta ken really

587
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:58.912
have been careful and thoughtful and
have taken really sensible

588
00:18:58.912 --> 00:19:01.620
have taken really sensible
precautions. It is really sad when

589
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.120
precautions. It is really sad when
important religious festivals have

590
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.328
important religious festivals have
been so heavily disrupted. We’ve

591
00:19:05.328 --> 00:19:08.037
been so heavily dismpted. We’ve
already

592
00:19:08.037 --> 00:19:10.495
been so heavily disrupted. We’ve
already mentioned Eid, Easter, holy

593
00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:11.453
already mentioned Eid, Easter, holy
week for. . .

594
00:19:11.453 --> 00:19:13.537
already mentioned Eid, Easter, holy
week for... We know all that, James,

595
00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:14.495
week for... We know all that, james,
but what ran you

596
00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:15.703
week for... We know all that, James,
but what can you tell us about what

597
00:19:15.703 --> 00:19:17.620
but what ran you tell us about what
will happen?

598
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.120
but what can you tell us about what
will happen? The guidelines we have

599
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.662
will happen? The guidelines we have
put forward have always been guided

600
00:19:20.662 --> 00:19:22.203
put forward have always been guided
by the science and there has always

601
00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:25.578
by the science and there has always
been a balancing act. 50 this idea

602
00:19:25.578 --> 00:19:26.578
been a balancing act. So this idea
that five days

603
00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:27.287
been a balancing act. 50 this idea
that five days of getting together

604
00:19:27.287 --> 00:19:28.828
that five days of getting together
at Christmas might lead to a month

605
00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:31.953
at Christmas might lead to a month
of lockdown? I know there’s a lot of

606
00:19:31.953 --> 00:19:33.328
of lockdown? I know there’s a lot of
speculation about what might be

607
00:19:33.328 --> 00:19:34.453
speculation about what might be
announced and obviously the Prime

608
00:19:34.453 --> 00:19:37.037
announced and obviously the Prime
Minister will let us know what the

609
00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:40.953
Minister will let us know what the
guideline changes might be, but our

610
00:19:40.953 --> 00:19:43.453
guideline changes might be, but our
response to coronavirus has not been

611
00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:46.203
response to coronavirus has not been
dictated by events in the diary,

612
00:19:46.203 --> 00:19:47.828
dictated by events in the diary,
it’s been dictated by the

613
00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:49.370
it’s been dictated by the
epidemiology. But hang on, Boris

614
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.745
epidemiology. But hang on, Boris
johnson has

615
00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:50.370
epidemiology. But hang on, Boris
Johnson has referred to Christmas

616
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.995
johnson has referred to Christmas
many times

617
00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:53.203
Johnson has referred to Christmas
many times and we know it is

618
00:19:53.203 --> 00:19:55.495
many times and we know it is
important and it’s something he is

619
00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:58.203
important and it’s something he is
factoring into decision and has

620
00:19:58.203 --> 00:19:58.787
factoring into decision and has
dearty

621
00:19:58.787 --> 00:20:01.328
factoring into decision and has
clearly talked about that he knows

622
00:20:01.328 --> 00:20:01.703
dearty talked about that he knows
everyone

623
00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:04.287
clearly talked about that he knows
everyone wants to be together for

624
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.453
everyone wants to be together for
Christmas. Yes, but the guidelines,

625
00:20:06.453 --> 00:20:09.953
Christmas. Yes, but the guidelines,
and we don’t know what they are and

626
00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:13.162
and we don’t know what they are and
we will be guided by the science,

627
00:20:13.162 --> 00:20:16.162
we will be guided by the science,
because people want to get together,

628
00:20:16.162 --> 00:20:16.662
because people want to get together,
not just

629
00:20:16.662 --> 00:20:17.662
because people want to get together,
notjust people of the Christian

630
00:20:17.662 --> 00:20:18.370
not just peopla of the Christian
faith, but

631
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:18.787
notjust people of the Christian
faith, but Christmas is

632
00:20:18.787 --> 00:20:20.078
faith, but Christmas is
traditionally a time of people of

633
00:20:20.078 --> 00:20:20.245
traditionally a time of peopla of
all

634
00:20:20.245 --> 00:20:21.912
traditionally a time of people of
all faiths or none to get together,

635
00:20:21.912 --> 00:20:23.328
all faiths or none to get together,
and that emotional safety net is

636
00:20:23.328 --> 00:20:24.037
and that emotional safety net is
actually really important.

637
00:20:24.037 --> 00:20:24.495
actually really important.
Throughout the government response

638
00:20:24.495 --> 00:20:25.787
Throughout the government response
to the pandemic, it’s about being

639
00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:28.287
to the pandemic, it’s about being
able to or trying as best as we can

640
00:20:28.287 --> 00:20:29.662
able to or trying as best as we ran
to balance

641
00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:30.412
able to or trying as best as we can
to balance the public health,

642
00:20:30.412 --> 00:20:33.787
to balance the public health,
people’s personal health, the

643
00:20:33.787 --> 00:20:35.037
people’s personal health, the
economic health, the emotional and

644
00:20:35.037 --> 00:20:36.162
economic health, the emotional and
psychological health of the country,

645
00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:38.370
psychological health of the country,
and none of these things are easy

646
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.787
and none of these things are easy
and they are all finely balanced and

647
00:20:41.787 --> 00:20:43.662
and they are all finely balanced and
the whole world is having to learn

648
00:20:43.662 --> 00:20:43.745
the whola world is having to learn
on

649
00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:44.245
the whole world is having to learn
on the job,

650
00:20:44.245 --> 00:20:44.578
the whola world is having to learn
on the job, but

651
00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:46.203
the whole world is having to learn
on the job, but we do want, as long

652
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:47.495
on the job, but we do want, as long
as it ran be

653
00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:48.828
on the job, but we do want, as long
as it can be done safely, people to

as it ran be done safely, peopla to
enjoy

really important part of the year.
Ian? This is a terrible time for

660
00:20:56.037 --> 00:20:57.578
Ian? This is a terrible time for
everybody and as politicians, we

661
00:20:57.578 --> 00:20:59.203
everybody and as politicians, we
should thank the public for the way

662
00:20:59.203 --> 00:20:59.537
should thank the public for the way
that peopla

663
00:20:59.537 --> 00:21:01.662
should thank the public for the way
that people have behaved. The fact

664
00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:02.662
that peopla have behaved. The fact
that peopla

665
00:21:02.662 --> 00:21:04.162
that people have behaved. The fact
that people have had to make

666
00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.370
that people have had to make
sacrifices for so long, the fact

667
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.287
sacrifices for so long, the fact
that peopla

668
00:21:06.287 --> 00:21:07.578
sacrifices for so long, the fact
that people have lost loved ones and

669
00:21:07.578 --> 00:21:08.078
that peopla have lost loved ones and
have not

670
00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:09.703
that people have lost loved ones and
have not been able to grieve in the

671
00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:11.537
have not been able to grieve in the
right way. We know there is some

672
00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:12.953
right way. We know there is some
hope with the vaccine, although it

673
00:21:12.953 --> 00:21:15.287
hope with the vaccine, although it
will take time to roll this out and

674
00:21:15.287 --> 00:21:17.495
will take time to roll this out and
we have to be careful about managing

675
00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:20.078
we have to be careful about managing
expectations as we go through this.

676
00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:21.370
expectations as we go through this.
What are the expectations for people

677
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:21.537
what are the expectations for people
in

678
00:21:21.537 --> 00:21:22.953
What are the expectations for people
in Scotland in terms of getting

679
00:21:22.953 --> 00:21:25.412
in Scotland in terms of getting
together at Christmas? Is it likely

680
00:21:25.412 --> 00:21:27.412
together at Christmas? Is it likely
to happen? One thing I will say is

681
00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:28.953
to happen? One thing I will say is
that the four governments will work

682
00:21:28.953 --> 00:21:30.162
that the four governments will work
together over this because we need

683
00:21:30.162 --> 00:21:32.578
together over this because we need
to make sure that there are

684
00:21:32.578 --> 00:21:33.662
to make sure that there are
opportunities where it is

685
00:21:33.662 --> 00:21:35.495
opportunities where it is
appropriate for people to travel.

686
00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:35.703
appropriate for peopla to travel.
Does

687
00:21:35.703 --> 00:21:37.287
appropriate for people to travel.
Does that mean we won’t see Nicola

688
00:21:37.287 --> 00:21:39.328
Does that mean we won’t see Nicola
Sturgeon making an announcement

689
00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:41.620
Sturgeon making an announcement
before the UK Government? That has

690
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.620
before the UK Government? That has
happened fairly frequently through

691
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:42.870
happened fairty frequently through
the

692
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.578
happened fairly frequently through
the pandemic. I am not saying

693
00:21:44.578 --> 00:21:44.995
the pandemic. I am not saying
critically, I’m

694
00:21:44.995 --> 00:21:45.162
the pandemic. I am not saying
critically, I’mjust

695
00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:45.828
the pandemic. I am not saying
critically, I’m just saying it’s a

696
00:21:45.828 --> 00:21:48.328
critically, I’m just saying it’s a
fact and are you saying she won’t do

697
00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:49.953
fact and are you saying she won’t do
that on this occasion? We obviously

698
00:21:49.953 --> 00:21:51.703
that on this occasion? We obviously
have responsibility for health in

00:21:51.703 --> 00:21:53.328
have responsibility for health in

705
00:21:58.745 --> 00:22:00.078
we are dictated by that timetable
and I hope people respect the

706
00:22:00.078 --> 00:22:01.703
and I hope people respect the
decisions taken, the announcements

the responsibility is because of the

709
00:22:05.787 --> 00:22:07.120
the responsibility is because of the
epidemiology that

710
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.537
the responsibility is because of the
epidemiology thatJames has

711
00:22:07.537 --> 00:22:07.703
the responsibility is because of the
epidemiology that James has talked

712
00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:07.953
epidemiology that james has talked
about.

713
00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:10.120
epidemiology that James has talked
about. But we are in a situation

714
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.787
about. But we are in a situation
where we took earlier action in

715
00:22:11.787 --> 00:22:12.787
where we took earlier action in
Scotland to tighten things in

716
00:22:12.787 --> 00:22:14.912
Scotland to tighten things in
September and we are beginning to

717
00:22:14.912 --> 00:22:16.745
September and we are beginning to
see some encouraging signs. It is

718
00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:17.328
see some encouraging signs. It is
earty, but

719
00:22:17.328 --> 00:22:18.078
see some encouraging signs. It is
early, but there are encouraging

720
00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:18.870
earty, but there are encouraging
signs that

721
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:19.537
early, but there are encouraging
signs that the numbers are

722
00:22:19.537 --> 00:22:21.078
signs that the numbers are
declining. All of us want to give

723
00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:21.495
declining. All of us want to give
peopla hope

724
00:22:21.495 --> 00:22:23.787
declining. All of us want to give
people hope and we have to think

725
00:22:23.787 --> 00:22:24.245
peopla hope and we have to think
about asking

726
00:22:24.245 --> 00:22:25.453
people hope and we have to think
about asking people to observe the

727
00:22:25.453 --> 00:22:25.703
about asking people to observe the
mles

728
00:22:25.703 --> 00:22:27.537
about asking people to observe the
rules and it’s important we do that,

729
00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:27.870
mles and it’s important we do that,
but we

730
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.537
rules and it’s important we do that,
but we have to think about those who

731
00:22:29.537 --> 00:22:31.703
but we have to think about those who
have been on their own for a long

732
00:22:31.703 --> 00:22:33.620
have been on their own for a long
time, those that are vulnerable, the

733
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.995
time, those that are vulnerable, the
mental health pressures we see. If

734
00:22:34.995 --> 00:22:35.370
mental health pressures we see. If
we ran

735
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.245
mental health pressures we see. If
we can find a way to give people a

736
00:22:37.245 --> 00:22:37.703
we ran find a way to give people a
little bit

737
00:22:37.703 --> 00:22:39.120
we can find a way to give people a
little bit of hope that they can

738
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.328
little bit of hope that they ran
have

739
00:22:39.328 --> 00:22:41.370
little bit of hope that they can
have some kind of family time, I

740
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:41.578
have some kind offamily time, I
would

741
00:22:41.578 --> 00:22:43.745
have some kind of family time, I
would ask people that they follow

742
00:22:43.745 --> 00:22:44.245
would ask peopla that they follow
exactly the

743
00:22:44.245 --> 00:22:45.037
would ask people that they follow
exactly the regulations put in

744
00:22:45.037 --> 00:22:45.620
exactly the regulations put in
place. I

745

750
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.787
granddaughter except for once this
year and we have to make sacrifices.

751
00:22:53.787 --> 00:22:56.203
year and we have to make sacrifices.
Life is on hold and we have to find

752
00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:58.578
Life is on hold and we have to find
a way to get through this safely

753
00:22:58.578 --> 00:22:59.787
a way to get through this safely
without increasing the risk of an

754
00:22:59.787 --> 00:23:01.412
without increasing the risk of an
increase in the infection as we come

755
00:23:01.412 --> 00:23:03.412
increase in the infection as we come
through the winter period. In our

756
00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:07.870
through the winter period. In our
audience, Tom. There are people who

absolutely a disgrace to the nation.

760
00:23:11.412 --> 00:23:13.703
absolutely a disgrace to the nation.
I don’t want to be thanked. You

761
00:23:13.703 --> 00:23:14.995
I don’t want to be thanked. You
shouldn’t be thanking anyone. The

762
00:23:14.995 --> 00:23:15.370
shouldn’t be thanking anyone. The
peopla who

763
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.745
shouldn’t be thanking anyone. The
people who are obeying the rules, we

people who are obeying the mles, we
know

765
00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:18.870
people who are obeying the rules, we
know what we are doing, but it’s the

766
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.620
know what we are doing, but it’s the
peopla who are

767
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.703

people who are not obeying the rules

00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:20.787
peopla who are not obeying the mles
are

769
00:23:20.787 --> 00:23:21.078
people who are not obeying the mles
are the

770
00:23:21.078 --> 00:23:22.370
people who are not obeying the rules
are the problem and as you are

771
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.787
are the problem and as you are
sitting there, all two metres apart,

772
00:23:23.787 --> 00:23:24.912
sitting there, all two metres apart,
you ran see it is

773
00:23:24.912 --> 00:23:25.870
sitting there, all two metres apart,
you can see it is possible to obey

774
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.537
you ran see it is possibla to obey
the mles

775
00:23:26.537 --> 00:23:27.495

the rules and have a conversation

the mles and have a conversation
and have

and have some sort of social
gathering. And that is the same for

779
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.245
gathering. And that is the same for
everybody else. You’ve just got to

780
00:23:34.245 --> 00:23:35.495
everybody else. You’ve just got to
obey the rules. It’s not

781
00:23:35.495 --> 00:23:37.995
obey the rules. It’s not
complicated. Dave? All

782
00:23:37.995 --> 00:23:38.412
obey the rules. It’s not
complicated. Dave? Alll

783
00:23:38.412 --> 00:23:38.787
obey the rules. It’s not
complicated. Dave? All I would say

784
00:23:38.787 --> 00:23:40.703
complicated. Dave? All I would say
is that we should stay at home as

785
00:23:40.703 --> 00:23:43.328
is that we should stay at home as
much as we can and I have family all

786
00:23:43.328 --> 00:23:43.703
much as we ran and I have family all
around the

787
00:23:43.703 --> 00:23:45.203
much as we can and I have family all
around the country who I can’t see,

788
00:23:45.203 --> 00:23:46.953
around the country who I can’t see,
but the one thing is that through

789
00:23:46.953 --> 00:23:48.745
but the one thing is that through
the last ten months we have been

790
00:23:48.745 --> 00:23:50.453
the last ten months we have been
told we are being guided by the

791
00:23:50.453 --> 00:23:52.162
told we are being guided by the
science but that doesn’t seem to be

792
00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:52.828
science but that doesn’t seem to be
the rase in

793
00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:53.162
science but that doesn’t seem to be
the case in all

794
00:23:53.162 --> 00:23:53.995
science but that doesn’t seem to be
the case in alljudgments we are

795
00:23:53.995 --> 00:23:54.412
the use in all judgments we are
making. I’m

796
00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:54.870
the case in alljudgments we are
making. I’mjust wondering

797
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:55.287
the case in alljudgments we are
making. I’m just wondering at what

798
00:23:55.287 --> 00:23:56.953
making. I’m just wondering at what
point in the next few months before

799
00:23:56.953 --> 00:23:58.662
point in the next few months before
the vaccine comes out that we will

800
00:23:58.662 --> 00:24:00.453
the vaccine comes out that we will
be guided by the science all the

801
00:24:00.453 --> 00:24:03.745
be guided by the science all the
time. Marina? It sounds to me like

802
00:24:03.745 --> 00:24:07.078
time. Marina? It sounds to me like
there will be some loosening of the

803
00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.703
there will be some loosening of the
restrictions around Christmas

804
00:24:08.703 --> 00:24:09.787
restrictions around Christmas
because of Christmas, and I

805
00:24:09.787 --> 00:24:10.328
restrictions around Christmas
because of Christmas, and Ijust

806
00:24:10.328 --> 00:24:12.203
because of Christmas, and Ijust
hope that the people who make up the

807
00:24:12.203 --> 00:24:12.578
hope that the people who make up the
mles will

808
00:24:12.578 --> 00:24:15.745
hope that the people who make up the
rules will think about such things

809
00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:15.870
mles will think about such things
as

810
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.912
rules will think about such things
as definitions of essential versus

811
00:24:16.912 --> 00:24:19.370
as definitions of essential versus
nonessential in the context of

812
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.412
nonessential in the context of
Christmas. For example, I

813
00:24:20.412 --> 00:24:20.703
nonessential in the context of
Christmas. For example, Ican

814
00:24:20.703 --> 00:24:21.245
nonessential in the context of
Christmas. For example, I can go to

815
00:24:21.245 --> 00:24:22.037
Christmas. For example, I ran go to
my [oral

816
00:24:22.037 --> 00:24:22.703
Christmas. For example, I can go to
my local supermarket and buy

817
00:24:22.703 --> 00:24:24.495
my local supermarket and buy
Christmas gifts and toys but my

818
00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:24.870
Christmas gifts and toys but my
[oral toy

819
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.953
Christmas gifts and toys but my
local toy shop is closed and that is

820
00:24:26.953 --> 00:24:27.412
[oral toy shop is closed and that is
a time

821
00:24:27.412 --> 00:24:29.245
local toy shop is closed and that is
a time that is so critical to them

822
00:24:29.245 --> 00:24:30.995
a time that is so critical to them
and there are so many examples of

823
00:24:30.995 --> 00:24:31.412
and there are so many examples of
that. I

824
00:24:31.412 --> 00:24:33.037
and there are so many examples of
that. Ijust hope that people are a

825
00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:33.453
that. Ijust hope that peopla are a
bit more

826
00:24:33.453 --> 00:24:34.745
that. Ijust hope that people are a
bit more sensible about their

827
00:24:34.745 --> 00:24:37.953
bit more sensible about their
definition of these rules. Fraser,

828
00:24:37.953 --> 00:24:38.370
definition of these mles. Fraser,
the question

829
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:38.828
definition of these rules. Fraser,
the question is, should the

830
00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:40.412
the question is, should the
government allow people to meet up

831
00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:41.745
government allow people to meet up
over Christmas if people are going

832
00:24:41.745 --> 00:24:42.203
over Christmas if peopla are going
to break

833
00:24:42.203 --> 00:24:43.703
over Christmas if people are going
to break the rules anyway? It’s

834
00:24:43.703 --> 00:24:44.162
to break the mles anyway? It’s
funny, the

835
00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:45.912
to break the rules anyway? It’s
funny, the government should be

836
00:24:45.912 --> 00:24:47.953
funny, the government should be
trusting people a bit more. I don’t

837
00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:50.287
trusting people a bit more. I don’t
believe that people behaved

838
00:24:50.287 --> 00:24:52.453
believe that people behaved
recklessly and I think the public

839
00:24:52.453 --> 00:24:53.495
recklessly and I think the public
have been incredibly restrained for

840
00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:55.870
have been incredibly restrained for
all of this year, and I think the

841
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:56.120
all of this year, and I think the
“Y

842
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.703
all of this year, and I think the
way the government is framing it is

843
00:24:57.703 --> 00:24:59.412
way the government is framing it is
a bit strange, saying you will have

844
00:24:59.412 --> 00:25:01.787
a bit strange, saying you will have
five days where it is a free for all

845
00:25:01.787 --> 00:25:02.787
five days where it is a free for all
and you ran see

846
00:25:02.787 --> 00:25:04.078
five days where it is a free for all
and you can see who you want but

847
00:25:04.078 --> 00:25:04.495
and you ran see who you want but
after that

848
00:25:04.495 --> 00:25:05.495
and you can see who you want but
after that the shutters will come

849
00:25:05.495 --> 00:25:06.453
after that the shutters will come
down. The government isn’t

850
00:25:06.453 --> 00:25:07.412
down. The government isn’t
suggesting that, there is

851
00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:09.078
suggesting that, there is
speculation they may and James is

852
00:25:09.078 --> 00:25:09.495
speculation they may and james is
not told

853
00:25:09.495 --> 00:25:10.662
speculation they may and James is
not told us what will happen and

854
00:25:10.662 --> 00:25:12.370
not told us what will happen and
that’s a bit frustrating but I see

855
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.412
that’s a bit frustrating but I see
the position. But the government

856
00:25:13.412 --> 00:25:14.995
the position. But the government
hasn’t told us that. That is

857
00:25:14.995 --> 00:25:17.745
hasn’t told us that. That is
speculation. This is the speculation

858
00:25:17.745 --> 00:25:19.245
speculation. This is the speculation
that the five days we will be

859
00:25:19.245 --> 00:25:21.370
that the five days we will be
released, to use the words the

860
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.162
released, to use the words the
health advisers are using, released

861
00:25:23.162 --> 00:25:25.578
health advisers are using, released
for five days and then 25 days of

862
00:25:25.578 --> 00:25:27.078
for five days and then 25 days of
lockdown to compensate which is what

863
00:25:27.078 --> 00:25:28.537
lockdown to compensate which is what
we heard yesterday. It doesn’t seem

864
00:25:28.537 --> 00:25:30.370
we heard yesterday. It doesn’t seem
to make a lot of sense to me,

865
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.662
to make a lot of sense to me,
because if they phrase it that way,

866
00:25:32.662 --> 00:25:33.745
because if they phrase it that way,
it’s almost an encouragement for

867
00:25:33.745 --> 00:25:35.745
it’s almost an encouragement for
people to go out and travel while

868
00:25:35.745 --> 00:25:36.745
peopla to go out and travel whila
they ran and

869
00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:38.912
people to go out and travel while
they can and in that way you might

870
00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:39.745
they ran and in that way you might
end up being

871
00:25:39.745 --> 00:25:39.995
they can and in that way you might
end up being counter—productive

872
00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:40.245
end up being counter-productive
where

873
00:25:40.245 --> 00:25:41.162
end up being counter—productive
where people are travelling when

874
00:25:41.162 --> 00:25:41.453
where peopla are travelling when
they might

875
00:25:41.453 --> 00:25:42.662
where people are travelling when
they might have stayed at home and

876
00:25:42.662 --> 00:25:44.120
they might have stayed at home and
thought that this is the Christmas

877
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.995
thought that this is the Christmas
where they won’t see my family, so I

878
00:25:45.995 --> 00:25:49.412
where they won’t see my family, so I
will see them at Easter or in

879
00:25:49.412 --> 00:25:49.578
will see them at Easter or in
Febmary,

880
00:25:49.578 --> 00:25:50.953
will see them at Easter or in
February, and if the government were

881
00:25:50.953 --> 00:25:52.037
Febmary, and if the government were
to give people a

882
00:25:52.037 --> 00:25:52.537
February, and if the government were
to give people a bit more

883
00:25:52.537 --> 00:25:54.662
to give people a bit more
discretion, it all depends, for

884
00:25:54.662 --> 00:25:56.620
discretion, it all depends, for
example, how bad the viruses at your

885
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.287
example, how bad the vimses at your
level. If you

886
00:25:57.287 --> 00:25:58.870
example, how bad the viruses at your
level. If you leave in a place where

887
00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.037
level. If you leave in a place where
it is bad for Covid, you wouldn’t

888
00:26:01.037 --> 00:26:03.037
it is bad for Covid, you wouldn’t
want to go to a place that didn’t

889
00:26:03.037 --> 00:26:05.412
want to go to a place that didn’t
have much, but if you are in one of

890
00:26:05.412 --> 00:26:07.495
have much, but if you are in one of
the parts of the country where there

891
00:26:07.495 --> 00:26:09.495
the parts of the country where there
is not much Covid and you want to

892
00:26:09.495 --> 00:26:10.745
is not much Covid and you want to
visit a relative there, that’s

893
00:26:10.745 --> 00:26:11.787
visit a relative there, that’s
different. I think people can be

894
00:26:11.787 --> 00:26:12.037
different. I think peopla ran be
tmsted

895
00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:13.453
different. I think people can be
trusted to make their own judgments

896
00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:14.078
tmsted to make their own judgments
here. The

897
00:26:14.078 --> 00:26:15.328
trusted to make their own judgments
here. The history of this year has

898
00:26:15.328 --> 00:26:17.370
here. The history of this year has
shown it and it is pretty strange to

899
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.828
shown it and it is pretty strange to
think that the government is sitting

900
00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:20.370
think that the government is sitting
there working out which days of the

901
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.662
there working out which days of the
year we should be allowed to see our

902
00:26:22.662 --> 00:26:24.995
year we should be allowed to see our
family or not. I’m sure there is a

903
00:26:24.995 --> 00:26:27.203
family or not. I’m sure there is a
more common—sense way of doing this.

904
00:26:27.203 --> 00:26:27.578
more common-sense way of doing this.
The Americans,

905
00:26:27.578 --> 00:26:28.662
more common—sense way of doing this.
The Americans, for example, have

906
00:26:28.662 --> 00:26:32.537
The Americans, for example, have
been advised not to see each other

907
00:26:32.537 --> 00:26:35.537
been advised not to see each other
for Thanksgiving. That’s quite a big

908
00:26:35.537 --> 00:26:37.953
for Thanksgiving. That’s quite a big
deal, it’s a big festival over

909
00:26:37.953 --> 00:26:39.703
deal, it’s a big festival over
there, but when Canada had the same

910
00:26:39.703 --> 00:26:43.203
there, but when Canada had the same
thing, the virus did spike in

911
00:26:43.203 --> 00:26:45.162
thing, the virus did spike in
Canada, so you can see that there

912
00:26:45.162 --> 00:26:45.912
Canada, so you ran see that there
are pretty good

913
00:26:45.912 --> 00:26:46.453
Canada, so you can see that there
are pretty good reasons. The

914
00:26:46.453 --> 00:26:47.453
are pretty good reasons. The
government wants to urge restraint

915
00:26:47.453 --> 00:26:49.745
government wants to urge restraint
and say we know you want to see your

916
00:26:49.745 --> 00:26:51.662
and say we know you want to see your
family that the virus levels are far

917
00:26:51.662 --> 00:26:53.328
family that the virus levels are far
too high in December to allow that

918
00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:55.245
too high in December to allow that
and people would respond to that, so

919
00:26:55.245 --> 00:26:55.620
and peopla would respond to that, so
it all

920
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.537
and people would respond to that, so
it all depends how things are

921
00:26:56.537 --> 00:26:58.537
it all depends how things are
looking at the end of next month,

922
00:26:58.537 --> 00:27:01.287
looking at the end of next month,
and I think people can be looked ——

923
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:01.745
and I think peopla ran be looked --
tmsted to

924
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:02.412
and I think people can be looked ——
trusted to make responsible

decisions. Five days versus 25,

00:27:13.203 --> 00:27:16.870
Christmas or allow a bit of free for
all? I’m not going to say, and I am

936
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.828
all? I’m not going to say, and I am
not going to say that this is easy

937
00:27:20.828 --> 00:27:22.412
not going to say that this is easy
and different people will give you

938
00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:24.245
and different people will give you
different answers as to what a

939
00:27:24.245 --> 00:27:25.203
different answers as to what a
successful Christmas is. Somebody

940
00:27:25.203 --> 00:27:27.287
successful Christmas is. Somebody
like me, I would say seeing my

941
00:27:27.287 --> 00:27:29.162
like me, I would say seeing my
family and I would want to see that

942
00:27:29.162 --> 00:27:30.662
family and I would want to see that
more than anything else and that

943
00:27:30.662 --> 00:27:32.412
more than anything else and that
would be a successful Christmas.

944
00:27:32.412 --> 00:27:35.120
would be a successful Christmas.
Rose might put more religion

945
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.495
Rose might put more religion
emphasis on this on the opportunity

946
00:27:36.495 --> 00:27:37.912
emphasis on this on the opportunity
to praise God together but other

947
00:27:37.912 --> 00:27:40.203
to praise God together but other
people might say as someone has

948
00:27:40.203 --> 00:27:42.245
people might say as someone has
already, that we need a healthy bank

949
00:27:42.245 --> 00:27:44.328
already, that we need a healthy bank
balance coming out of Christmas

950
00:27:44.328 --> 00:27:45.203
balance coming out of Christmas
because we absolutely depend on

951
00:27:45.203 --> 00:27:48.120
because we absolutely depend on
Christmas portrayed, and frankly,

952
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.120
Christmas portrayed, and frankly,
teenagers might be thinking, never

953
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.620
teenagers might be thinking, never
mind the family, it’s an opportunity

954
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.412
mind the family, it’s an opportunity
for us to have a party, so lots of

955
00:27:54.412 --> 00:27:54.912
forustohavea party, solotsof
peopla have

956
00:27:54.912 --> 00:27:56.537
for us to have a party, so lots of
people have different expectations

957
00:27:56.537 --> 00:27:58.787
people have different expectations
and even my definition of family,

958
00:27:58.787 --> 00:27:59.620
and even my definition offamily,
who is family

959
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.912
and even my definition of family,
who is family and who is not family?

960
00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:03.912
who is family and who is not family?
There are people who don’t

961
00:28:03.912 --> 00:28:04.745
There are people who don’t
necessarily have family who spend

962
00:28:04.745 --> 00:28:07.245
necessarily have family who spend
time with a family but would they be

963
00:28:07.245 --> 00:28:09.203
time with a family but would they be
allowed to spend time at Christmas

964
00:28:09.203 --> 00:28:11.370
allowed to spend time at Christmas
with us? And if the deal is you can

965
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.120
with us? And if the deal is you ran
spend five days

966
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.953
with us? And if the deal is you can
spend five days with another family

967
00:28:12.953 --> 00:28:13.495
spend five days with another family
or you rannot

968
00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:14.578
spend five days with another family
or you cannot spend five days with

969
00:28:14.578 --> 00:28:16.203
or you cannot spend five days with
the family because you are not

970
00:28:16.203 --> 00:28:17.662
the family because you are not
strictly family but you have to be

971
00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.787
strictly family but you have to be
locked down for 25 days after, you

972
00:28:19.787 --> 00:28:20.328
locked down for 25 days after, you
ran see

973
00:28:20.328 --> 00:28:22.745
locked down for 25 days after, you
can see how these things are not

974
00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:23.412
ran see how these things are not
easy. But one

975
00:28:23.412 --> 00:28:24.662
can see how these things are not
easy. But one thing we have to be

976
00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:26.828
easy. But one thing we have to be
clear about is that the way we get

977
00:28:26.828 --> 00:28:28.745
clear about is that the way we get
through this is by having a pact

978
00:28:28.745 --> 00:28:30.370
through this is by having a pact
between the people and government,

979
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.412
between the people and government,
and I think the British people,

980
00:28:32.412 --> 00:28:32.537
and I think the British peopla,
actually,

981
00:28:32.537 --> 00:28:34.328
and I think the British people,
actually, have shown for the last

982
00:28:34.328 --> 00:28:35.703
actually, have shown for the last
year that they are responsible, that

983
00:28:35.703 --> 00:28:37.537
year that they are responsible, that
they know what they have to do

984
00:28:37.537 --> 00:28:38.870
they know what they have to do
because they are looking after each

985
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.412
because they are looking after each
other and they know that they are as

986
00:28:42.412 --> 00:28:43.245
other and they know that they are as
responsible as the most

987
00:28:43.245 --> 00:28:44.578
responsible as the most
irresponsible person. We are all in

988
00:28:44.578 --> 00:28:44.745
irresponsibla person. We are all in
this

989
00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:47.037
irresponsible person. We are all in
this together, but they need to have

990
00:28:47.037 --> 00:28:49.162
this together, but they need to have
leadership, clear leadership from

991
00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:49.328
leadership, dear leadership from
the

992
00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:50.537
leadership, clear leadership from
the government with a clear plan

993
00:28:50.537 --> 00:28:50.953
the government with a dear plan
which is

994
00:28:50.953 --> 00:28:52.745
the government with a clear plan
which is properly articulated, that

995
00:28:52.745 --> 00:28:53.162
which is property articulated, that
peopla know

996
00:28:53.162 --> 00:28:55.745
which is properly articulated, that
people know what is expected of them

997
00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:58.203
people know what is expected of them
and in that way, if we can be shown

998
00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:58.953
and in that way, if we ran be shown
the way through,

999
00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:00.120
and in that way, if we can be shown
the way through, then I think that

1000
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.495
the way through, then I think that
peopla will

1001
00:29:00.495 --> 00:29:01.453
the way through, then I think that
people will fall into line because

1002
00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:01.662
peopla will fall into line because
in

1003
00:29:01.662 --> 00:29:03.120
people will fall into line because
in the end, British people want to

1004
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.203
in the end, British peopla want to
do

1005
00:29:03.203 --> 00:29:05.037
in the end, British people want to
do the right thing. We may not have

1006
00:29:05.037 --> 00:29:06.912
do the right thing. We may not have
a proper Christmas this year but we

1007
00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:09.120
a proper Christmas this year but we
sure as hell ought to have one next

1008
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.495
sure as hell ought to have one next
year and that is what we should work

1009
00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:13.662
year and that is what we should work
towards. I want to move on, but you

1010
00:29:13.662 --> 00:29:15.745
towards. I want to move on, but you
wanted to cut in. We just need to

1011
00:29:15.745 --> 00:29:17.495
wanted to cut in. We just need to
accept that for this year, Christmas

1012
00:29:17.495 --> 00:29:19.703
accept that for this year, Christmas
is not going to be as it has always

1013
00:29:19.703 --> 00:29:23.287
is not going to be as it has always
been, and frankly, whatever happens,

1014
00:29:23.287 --> 00:29:25.328
been, and frankly, whatever happens,
Christmas is not going to be

1015
00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:27.120
Christmas is not going to be
cancelled because Christmas is not

1016
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.328
ancellad because Christmas is not
about

1017
00:29:27.328 --> 00:29:28.162
cancelled because Christmas is not
about the pandemic, Christmas is

1018
00:29:28.162 --> 00:29:31.287
about the pandemic, Christmas is
about love, the love we show to

1019
00:29:31.287 --> 00:29:32.912
about love, the love we show to
peopla and in

1020
00:29:32.912 --> 00:29:33.537
about love, the love we show to
people and in particular to those

1021
00:29:33.537 --> 00:29:34.453
peopla and in particular to those
most

1022
00:29:34.453 --> 00:29:37.953
people and in particular to those
most vulnerable in our communities.

1023
00:29:37.953 --> 00:29:39.037
most vulnerable in our communities.
Let’s take another question from

1024
00:29:39.037 --> 00:29:43.953
Let’s take another question from
Richard.

1025
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:49.537
Richard. Will Boris’s remark
increase the chances of Scotland

1026
00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:52.453
increase the chances of Scotland
breaking away from the UK and has

1027
00:29:52.453 --> 00:29:53.787
breaking away from the UK and has
Devolution been a disaster question

1028
00:29:53.787 --> 00:29:54.120
Devolution been a disaster question
at Boris

1029
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.287
Devolution been a disaster question
at BorisJohnson is reported having

1030
00:29:57.287 --> 00:29:57.453
at Boris johnson is reported having
said

1031
00:29:57.453 --> 00:29:59.203
at BorisJohnson is reported having
said that devolution had been a in

1032
00:29:59.203 --> 00:30:03.037
said that devolution had been a in
Scotland. Ian, not

1033
00:30:03.037 --> 00:30:03.412
said that devolution had been a in
Scotland. Ian, nota

1034
00:30:03.412 --> 00:30:04.120
said that devolution had been a in
Scotland. Ian, not a view you might

1035
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.203
Scotland. Ian, not a view you might
concur with,

1036
00:30:06.203 --> 00:30:06.537
Scotland. Ian, not a view you might
concurwith, but

1037
00:30:06.537 --> 00:30:07.412
Scotland. Ian, not a view you might
concur with, but has his remarks

1038
00:30:07.412 --> 00:30:08.537
concur with, but has his remarks
increase the chance of Scotland

1039
00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:10.453
increase the chance of Scotland
breaking away from the UK? What

1040
00:30:10.453 --> 00:30:11.037
breaking away from the UK? what
you’ve seen in

1041
00:30:11.037 --> 00:30:12.120
breaking away from the UK? What
you’ve seen in the course of the

1042
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.703
you’ve seen in the course of the
last few months is a consistency in

1043
00:30:13.703 --> 00:30:16.037
last few months is a consistency in
the polls that has shown a majority

1044
00:30:16.037 --> 00:30:18.078
the polls that has shown a majority
for independence and over the piece,

1045
00:30:18.078 --> 00:30:19.412
for independence and over the piece,
that has been increasing. I think

1046
00:30:19.412 --> 00:30:20.537
that has been increasing. I think
what Boris Johnson

1047
00:30:20.537 --> 00:30:22.412
that has been increasing. I think
what BorisJohnson has shown by his

1048
00:30:22.412 --> 00:30:22.620
what Boris johnson has shown by his
remarks

1049
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.370
what BorisJohnson has shown by his
remarks is disrespect to the people

1050
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.662
remarks is disrespect to the people
of Scotland and a disrespect for

1051
00:30:25.662 --> 00:30:28.537
of Scotland and a disrespect for
devolution and I have to say that it

1052
00:30:28.537 --> 00:30:30.370
devolution and I have to say that it
is someone who simply doesn’t

1053
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.537
is someone who simply doesn’t
understand modern day Scotland.

1054
00:30:32.537 --> 00:30:33.287
understand modern day Scotland.
Scotland has changed tremendously

1055
00:30:33.287 --> 00:30:36.370
Scotland has changed tremendously
over the course of the last 21

1056
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.370
over the course of the last 21
years. The clarification from 10

1057
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.412
years. The clarification from 10
Downing Street is that Boris

1058
00:30:39.412 --> 00:30:39.578
years. The clarification from 10
Downing Street is that BorisJohnson

1059
00:30:39.578 --> 00:30:39.745
Downing Street is that Boris johnson
doesn’t

1060
00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:40.953
Downing Street is that BorisJohnson
doesn’t have a problem with

1061
00:30:40.953 --> 00:30:43.162
doesn’t have a problem with
devolution, but he has a problem

1062
00:30:43.162 --> 00:30:45.162
devolution, but he has a problem
with you, the SNP. He has said what

1063
00:30:45.162 --> 00:30:47.412
with you, the SNP. He has said what
he has said and tried to roll

1064
00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:47.703
with you, the SNP. He has said what
he has said and tried to rollback,

1065
00:30:47.703 --> 00:30:48.162
he has said and tried to roll back,
but the

1066
00:30:48.162 --> 00:30:50.037
he has said and tried to rollback,
but the fact is the SNP has won

1067
00:30:50.037 --> 00:30:51.453
but the fact is the SNP has won
every election to the Scottish

1068
00:30:51.453 --> 00:30:53.245
every election to the Scottish
parliament since 2007 and are way

1069
00:30:53.245 --> 00:30:53.537
partiament since 2007 and are way
ahead in

1070
00:30:53.537 --> 00:30:55.245
parliament since 2007 and are way
ahead in the polls and there is

1071
00:30:55.245 --> 00:30:56.453
ahead in the polls and there is
massive public satisfaction with the

1072
00:30:56.453 --> 00:30:56.620
massive public satisfaction with the
“Y

1073
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.703
massive public satisfaction with the
way the government and the First

1074
00:30:57.703 --> 00:30:59.620
way the government and the First
Minister in particular are dealing

1075
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.287
Minister in particular are dealing
with the pandemic. I look over what

1076
00:31:02.287 --> 00:31:04.287
with the pandemic. I look over what
we have done over the course of the

1077
00:31:04.287 --> 00:31:05.745
we have done over the course of the
last 20 years, not having tuition

1078
00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:08.245
last 20 years, not having tuition
fees, the fact we have free personal

1079
00:31:08.245 --> 00:31:08.828
fees, the fact we have free personal
rare, the fact

1080
00:31:08.828 --> 00:31:09.870
fees, the fact we have free personal
care, the fact we have world leading

1081
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.120
rare, the fact we have world leading
climate change

1082
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:12.495
care, the fact we have world leading
climate change legislation. There’s

1083
00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:12.912
climate change lagislation. There’s
an awful

1084
00:31:12.912 --> 00:31:15.412
climate change legislation. There’s
an awful lot to be proud of and I

1085
00:31:15.412 --> 00:31:16.953
an awful lot to be proud of and I
think that what this crisis has

1086
00:31:16.953 --> 00:31:18.703
think that what this crisis has
shown and what Brexit has shown is

1087
00:31:18.703 --> 00:31:20.745
shown and what Brexit has shown is
that there are limitations on our

1088
00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:21.578
that there are limitations on our
Parliament and increasingly people

00:31:21.578 --> 00:31:22.203
Partiament and increasingly peopla
are making

1090
00:31:22.203 --> 00:31:22.495
Parliament and increasingly people
are making that

1091
00:31:22.495 --> 00:31:23.453
Parliament and increasingly people
are making thatjudgment that it is

1092
00:31:23.453 --> 00:31:24.245
are making that judgment that it is
time to

1093
00:31:24.245 --> 00:31:26.037
are making thatjudgment that it is
time to finish the journey. The real

1094
00:31:26.037 --> 00:31:27.787
time to finish the journey. The real
question out of this and the

1095
00:31:27.787 --> 00:31:28.412
question out of this and the
attitude of Boris

1096
00:31:28.412 --> 00:31:29.203
question out of this and the
attitude of BorisJohnson has shown

1097
00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:29.787
attitude of Boris johnson has shown
in the way

1098
00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:31.578
attitude of BorisJohnson has shown
in the way that he has said it does

1099
00:31:31.578 --> 00:31:33.787
in the way that he has said it does
not really matter if people vote for

1100
00:31:33.787 --> 00:31:35.870
not really matter if people vote for
the SNP, and of course we fought the

1101
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.412
the SNP, and of course we fought the
last election on the right of

1102
00:31:37.412 --> 00:31:38.953
last election on the right of
Scotland to choose. This election is

1103
00:31:38.953 --> 00:31:40.287
Scotland to choose. This elaction is
going to be

1104
00:31:40.287 --> 00:31:41.037
Scotland to choose. This election is
going to be about Scotland’s right

1105
00:31:41.037 --> 00:31:42.828
going to be about Scotland’s right
to choose and if we win that

1106
00:31:42.828 --> 00:31:44.537
to choose and if we win that
election, it has to be absolutely

1107
00:31:44.537 --> 00:31:45.912
election, it has to be absolutely
clear that if democracy will

1108
00:31:45.912 --> 00:31:46.953
clear that if democracy will
prevail, as we talked about

1109
00:31:46.953 --> 00:31:48.245
prevail, as we talked about
democracy and other parts of the

1110
00:31:48.245 --> 00:31:50.828
democracy and other parts of the
world recently, in the US, that the

1111
00:31:50.828 --> 00:31:51.245
world recently, in the US, that the
peopla of

1112
00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:52.495
world recently, in the US, that the
people of Scotland are the ones that

1113
00:31:52.495 --> 00:31:52.703
peopla of Scotland are the ones that
have

1114
00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:53.953
people of Scotland are the ones that
have the right to determine their

1115
00:31:53.953 --> 00:31:55.245
have the right to determine their
own future. We desperately want to

1116
00:31:55.245 --> 00:31:58.078
own future. We desperately want to
find a way back into Europe and it

1117
00:31:58.078 --> 00:31:59.703
find a way back into Europe and it
is right, as parliamentarians, as

1118
00:31:59.703 --> 00:31:59.953
is right, as partiamentarians, as
Democrats,

1119
00:31:59.953 --> 00:32:00.662
is right, as parliamentarians, as
Democrats, all of us should

1120
00:32:00.662 --> 00:32:02.287
Democrats, all of us should
recognise the right of the people of

1121
00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:04.245
recognise the right of the people of
Scotland to have their say in a

1122
00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:07.162
Scotland to have their say in a
referendum. Fraser, the question is,

1123
00:32:07.162 --> 00:32:08.537
referendum. Fraser, the question is,
has Devolution been a disaster and

1124
00:32:08.537 --> 00:32:09.912
has Devolution been a disaster and
will Boris Johnson’s

1125
00:32:09.912 --> 00:32:10.453
has Devolution been a disaster and
will BorisJohnson’s remarks

1126
00:32:10.453 --> 00:32:11.495
will BorisJohnson’s remarks
increase the chance of Scotland

1127
00:32:11.495 --> 00:32:15.578
increase the chance of Scotland
becoming independent?

1128
00:32:15.578 --> 00:32:15.828
ii

1129
00:32:15.828 --> 00:32:20.245
It was a daft remark, especially for
the lead of a party has many people

1130
00:32:20.245 --> 00:32:20.537
the lead of a party has many peopla
standing for

1131
00:32:20.537 --> 00:32:21.245
the lead of a party has many people
standing for the devolved parliament

1132
00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:21.578
standing for the devolved partiament
next year.

1133
00:32:21.578 --> 00:32:24.828
standing for the devolved parliament
next year. That said, I have some

1134
00:32:24.828 --> 00:32:29.787
next year. That said, I have some
sympathy with the overall sentiment.

1135
00:32:29.787 --> 00:32:31.203
sympathy with the overall sentiment.
I thought devolution would be very

1136
00:32:31.203 --> 00:32:32.787
I thought devolution would be very
different to what it turned out as.

1137
00:32:32.787 --> 00:32:36.620
different to what it turned out as.
I remember at the time thinking, and

1138
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.745
I remember at the time thinking, and
I’m sure Scotland has world—class

1139
00:32:37.745 --> 00:32:38.037
I’m sure Scotland has world-class
climate

1140
00:32:38.037 --> 00:32:39.828
I’m sure Scotland has world—class
climate legislation but it also has

1141
00:32:39.828 --> 00:32:40.037
climate lagislation but it also has
some

1142
00:32:40.037 --> 00:32:40.995
climate legislation but it also has
some of the worst poverty and

1143
00:32:40.995 --> 00:32:43.037
some of the worst poverty and
deprivation in western Europe. Life

1144
00:32:43.037 --> 00:32:45.078
deprivation in western Europe. Life
expectancy in some parts of Glasgow

1145
00:32:45.078 --> 00:32:45.453
expectancy in some parts of Glasgow
is lass

1146
00:32:45.453 --> 00:32:46.662
expectancy in some parts of Glasgow
is less than it is in Rwanda, and

1147
00:32:46.662 --> 00:32:48.620
is lass than it is in Rwanda, and
it’s shocking to

1148
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.662
is less than it is in Rwanda, and
it’s shocking to stop always thought

1149
00:32:49.662 --> 00:32:49.870
it’s shocking to stop always thought
hack

1150
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.078
it’s shocking to stop always thought
back then that was because, if there

1151
00:32:51.078 --> 00:32:53.578
back then that was because, if there
was a Scottish Parliament, there

1152
00:32:53.578 --> 00:32:53.828
was a Scottish Partiament, there
would

1153
00:32:53.828 --> 00:32:55.245
was a Scottish Parliament, there
would be a lot more focus on

1154
00:32:55.245 --> 00:32:56.453
would be a lot more focus on
inequality and poverty and a lot

1155
00:32:56.453 --> 00:32:58.328
inequality and poverty and a lot
more intellectual resource piled

1156
00:32:58.328 --> 00:33:00.912
more intellectual resource piled
into making this problem better. And

1157
00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:05.787
into making this problem better. And
that instead we have seen horrible

1158
00:33:05.787 --> 00:33:05.995
that instead we have seen horrible
9’P5-

1159
00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:06.245
that instead we have seen horrible
gaps. really.

1160
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:06.828
that instead we have seen horrible
gaps, really, between attainment

1161
00:33:06.828 --> 00:33:09.412
gaps, really, between attainment
between the rich and the poor in

1162
00:33:09.412 --> 00:33:10.370
between the rich and the poor in
Scottish schools, Nicola Sturgeon

1163
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.120
Scottish schools, Nicola Sturgeon
has to be judged

1164
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.328
Scottish schools, Nicola Sturgeon
has to bejudged on

1165
00:33:11.328 --> 00:33:11.912
Scottish schools, Nicola Sturgeon
has to be judged on that and it’s

1166
00:33:11.912 --> 00:33:14.787
has to be judged on that and it’s
not getting much better. Rather than

1167
00:33:14.787 --> 00:33:16.037
not getting much better. Rather than
the energy going into making things

1168
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:18.453
the energy going into making things
better for the people of Scotland,

1169
00:33:18.453 --> 00:33:20.662
better for the people of Scotland,
going into talking instead about the

1170
00:33:20.662 --> 00:33:22.995
going into talking instead about the
constitution, about an independence

1171
00:33:22.995 --> 00:33:23.787
constitution, about an independence
referendum, about having another

1172
00:33:23.787 --> 00:33:27.370
referendum, about having another
fight with Westminster. It’s pretty

1173
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.995
fight with Westminster. It’s pretty
difficult to blame Westminster for

1174
00:33:28.995 --> 00:33:30.245
difficult to blame Westminster for
things that are entirely in the

1175
00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:34.662
things that are entirely in the
control of the Scottish Parliament.

1176
00:33:34.662 --> 00:33:36.328
control of the Scottish Partiament.
It’s only in the

1177
00:33:36.328 --> 00:33:37.412
control of the Scottish Parliament.
It’s only in the last year we have

1178
00:33:37.412 --> 00:33:38.453
It’s only in the last year we have
had some responsibility for social

1179
00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:41.287
had some responsibility for social
security. We have been praised by

1180
00:33:41.287 --> 00:33:44.370
security. We have been praised by
the UN for our approach to poverty,

1181
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.287
the UN for our approach to poverty,
introducing eight different

1182
00:33:45.287 --> 00:33:46.787
introducing eight different
measures, four of them entirely new,

1183
00:33:46.787 --> 00:33:48.787
measures, four of them entirely new,
for example, what we have done in

1184
00:33:48.787 --> 00:33:50.912
for example, what we have done in
terms of the £10 allowance for young

1185
00:33:50.912 --> 00:33:52.703
terms of the £10 allowance for young
people, to drive them out of

1186
00:33:52.703 --> 00:33:52.870
peopla, to drive them out of
poverty.

1187
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.537
people, to drive them out of
poverty, and life expectancy in

1188
00:33:54.537 --> 00:33:56.162
poverty, and life expectancy in
Scotland has increased over the

1189
00:33:56.162 --> 00:33:57.162
Scotland has increased over the
lifetime of the parliament. There

1190
00:33:57.162 --> 00:33:57.328
lifetime of the partiament. There
has

1191
00:33:57.328 --> 00:34:01.953
lifetime of the parliament. There
has been a greater increase in

1192
00:34:01.953 --> 00:34:03.370
has been a greater increase in
London, but the increase in life

1193
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.620
London, but the increase in life
expectancy in Scotland has been

1194
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.037
expectancy in Scotland has been
higher than it has elsewhere in the

1195
00:34:06.037 --> 00:34:08.953
higher than it has elsewhere in the
UK, so what you are saying is a

1196
00:34:08.953 --> 00:34:10.162
UK, so what you are saying is a
gross distortion of the truth. If

1197
00:34:10.162 --> 00:34:12.620
gross distortion of the truth. If
you look at the number of young

1198
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.162
you look at the number of young
peopla going

1199
00:34:13.162 --> 00:34:13.870
you look at the number of young
people going to university, young

1200
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:14.203
peopla going to university, young
peopla in

1201
00:34:14.203 --> 00:34:15.287
people going to university, young
people in Glasgow, what we have done

1202
00:34:15.287 --> 00:34:15.578
peopla in Glasgow, what we have done
with the

1203
00:34:15.578 --> 00:34:17.620
people in Glasgow, what we have done
with the attainment fund, there is

1204
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.162
with the attainment fund, there is
an improvement in the attainment of

1205
00:34:19.162 --> 00:34:20.412
an improvement in the attainment of
young people coming from the most

1206
00:34:20.412 --> 00:34:24.412
young people coming from the most
deprived areas. You mentioned

1207
00:34:24.412 --> 00:34:25.703
deprived areas. You mentioned
university but, if you are from a

1208
00:34:25.703 --> 00:34:28.412
university but, if you are from a
deprived background in Scotland, you

1209
00:34:28.412 --> 00:34:29.953
deprived background in Scotland, you
are almost half as likely to get

1210
00:34:29.953 --> 00:34:32.453
are almost half as likely to get
into university as you are from a

1211
00:34:32.453 --> 00:34:34.037
into university as you are from a
similar background in England. That

1212
00:34:34.037 --> 00:34:36.078
similar background in England. That
is an absolute scandal, and that is

1213
00:34:36.078 --> 00:34:38.162
is an absolute scandal, and that is
exactly the sort of thing devolution

1214
00:34:38.162 --> 00:34:39.370
exactly the sort of thing devolution
was supposed to address, but those

1215
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:39.453
was supposed to address, but those
9’P5

1216
00:34:39.453 --> 00:34:40.953
was supposed to address, but those
gaps are still there. It pains me to

1217
00:34:40.953 --> 00:34:45.912
gaps are still there. It pains me to
see.

1218
00:34:46.412 --> 00:34:47.037
see. This can’t just

1219
00:34:47.037 --> 00:34:48.662
see. This can’tjust be a
conversation between you and I am

1220
00:34:48.662 --> 00:34:52.787
conversation between you and I am
sorry about that. Devolution, under

1221
00:34:52.787 --> 00:34:54.745
sorry about that. Devolution, under
Tony Blair, was supposed to sort out

1222
00:34:54.745 --> 00:34:55.245
Tony Blair, was supposed to sort out
the problams,

1223
00:34:55.245 --> 00:34:57.953
Tony Blair, was supposed to sort out
the problems, as he saw it, the SNP

1224
00:34:57.953 --> 00:35:00.037
the problems, as he saw it, the SNP
and keep Scotland together as part

1225
00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:02.953
and keep Scotland together as part
of the union. It’s not been a

1226
00:35:02.953 --> 00:35:05.037
of the union. It’s not been a
success, has it? I

1227
00:35:05.037 --> 00:35:05.412
of the union. It’s not been a
success, has it? Ithink

1228
00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:05.995
of the union. It’s not been a
success, has it? I think actually

1229
00:35:05.995 --> 00:35:08.912
success, has it? I think actually
devolution was about making sure

1230
00:35:08.912 --> 00:35:11.370
devolution was about making sure
that power got closer to people so

1231
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:11.578
that power got closer to peopla so
that

1232
00:35:11.578 --> 00:35:12.412
that power got closer to people so
that there was more accountability

1233
00:35:12.412 --> 00:35:14.703
that there was more accountability
and better decisions were made. Yes,

1234
00:35:14.703 --> 00:35:18.120
and better decisions were made. Yes,
but politically Tony Blair was

1235
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.703
but politically Tony Blair was
hoping that it would dampen down any

1236
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:24.912
hoping that it would dampen down any
fire for independence had to keep

1237
00:35:24.912 --> 00:35:27.745
fire for independence had to keep
Scotland to the union. I think

1238
00:35:27.745 --> 00:35:29.578
Scotland to the union. I think
devolution has not gone far enough,

1239
00:35:29.578 --> 00:35:31.412
devolution has not gone far enough,
I think we can devolve more power.

1240
00:35:31.412 --> 00:35:32.328
I think we ran devolve more power.
You have

1241
00:35:32.328 --> 00:35:33.370
I think we can devolve more power.
You have seen it from Andy Burnham,

1242
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.995
You have seen it from Andy Burnham,
how much he wants to have more power

1243
00:35:34.995 --> 00:35:37.620
how much he wants to have more power
and authority in places like

1244
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.995
and authority in places like
Manchester. In the Highlands and

1245
00:35:38.995 --> 00:35:40.537
Manchester. In the Highlands and
islands of Scotland, they feel they

1246
00:35:40.537 --> 00:35:41.953
islands of Scotland, they feel they
are a long way from Edinburgh and

1247
00:35:41.953 --> 00:35:43.245
are a long way from Edinburgh and
they feel they are not given

1248
00:35:43.245 --> 00:35:44.162
they feel they are not given
sufficient power over their own

1249
00:35:44.162 --> 00:35:50.287
sufficient power over their own
destiny. What was great to hear was

1250
00:35:50.287 --> 00:35:50.870
destiny. what was great to hear was
to hear peopla

1251
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:51.370
destiny. What was great to hear was
to hear people actually talking

1252
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:51.745
to hear peopla actually talking
about

1253
00:35:51.745 --> 00:35:52.578
to hear people actually talking
about issues in relation to

1254
00:35:52.578 --> 00:35:53.703
about issues in relation to
Scotland, because I think too often

1255
00:35:53.703 --> 00:35:57.912
Scotland, because I think too often
it boils down to, you know,

1256
00:35:57.912 --> 00:35:58.578
it boils down to, you know,
constantly talking about

1257
00:35:58.578 --> 00:35:59.995
constantly talking about
constitutional issues, when there

1258
00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:03.370
constitutional issues, when there
are major problems. May I say one

1259
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.578
are major problams. May I say one
thing in Nicola

1260
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:04.995
are major problems. May I say one
thing in Nicola Sturgeon’s defence,

1261
00:36:04.995 --> 00:36:06.412
thing in Nicola Sturgeon’s defence,
and you never thought you would hear

1262
00:36:06.412 --> 00:36:09.078
and you never thought you would hear
me say that, but when you are

1263
00:36:09.078 --> 00:36:10.037
me say that, but when you are
saying, Nicola Sturgeon, she is

1264
00:36:10.037 --> 00:36:12.495
saying, Nicola Sturgeon, she is
making all those announcements on

1265
00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:16.662
making all those announcements on
Covid... Chemical I was pointing it

1266
00:36:16.662 --> 00:36:21.037
Covid... Chemical I was pointing it
out as a fact. The reason she was

1267
00:36:21.037 --> 00:36:22.495
out as a fact. The reason she was
doing it was that, quite often, a

1268
00:36:22.495 --> 00:36:24.370
doing it was that, quite often, a
number of these things were about

1269
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.162
number of these things were about
school terms and university terms

1270
00:36:26.162 --> 00:36:27.453
school terms and university terms
and, because you go back to school

1271
00:36:27.453 --> 00:36:30.620
and, because you go back to school
faster in Scotland, they needed to

1272
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.745
faster in Scotland, they needed to
make decisions about what to happen

1273
00:36:32.745 --> 00:36:34.078
make decisions about what to happen
with youngsters, so therefore

1274
00:36:34.078 --> 00:36:36.037
with youngsters, so therefore
decisions had to be made and,

1275
00:36:36.037 --> 00:36:37.953
decisions had to be made and,
frankly, if they had waited for the

1276
00:36:37.953 --> 00:36:39.078
frankly, if they had waited for the
UK Government to make the decision,

1277
00:36:39.078 --> 00:36:40.287
UK Government to make the decision,
in would already have started.

1278
00:36:40.287 --> 00:36:42.162
in would already have started.
That’s an example of devolution in

1279
00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:43.287
That’s an example of devolution in
action and doing things for the

1280
00:36:43.287 --> 00:36:47.245
action and doing things for the
better. Let’s focus on people’s

1281
00:36:47.245 --> 00:36:48.620
better. Let’s focus on people’s
lives, because that is what it’s all

1282
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.537
lives, because that is what it’s all
about. We have two Mike Richards, so

1283
00:36:53.537 --> 00:36:56.162
about. We have two Mike Richards, so
I have to you by your initials.

1284
00:36:56.162 --> 00:37:00.912
I have to you by your initials.
Richard E. Good evening. Devolution

1285
00:37:00.912 --> 00:37:05.120
Richard E. Good evening. Devolution
has been a roaring success. In

1286
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.495
has been a roaring success. In
Windsor, we are keen on the localism

1287
00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:09.203
Windsor, we are keen on the localism
agenda and we are trying to

1288
00:37:09.203 --> 00:37:10.203
agenda and we are trying to
introduce a town council because

1289
00:37:10.203 --> 00:37:13.287
introduce a town council because
believe local people should be in

1290
00:37:13.287 --> 00:37:14.537
believe local people should be in
charge of local decisions. It’s a

1291
00:37:14.537 --> 00:37:14.870
charge of [oral decisions. It’s a
very simple

1292
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:15.745
charge of local decisions. It’s a
very simple message. The problem I

1293
00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:19.703
very simple message. The problem I
have is that I remember the

1294
00:37:19.703 --> 00:37:22.162
have is that I remember the
devolution campaign back in 96—97,

1295
00:37:22.162 --> 00:37:22.537
devolution campaign back in 96-97,
and one

1296
00:37:22.537 --> 00:37:24.203
devolution campaign back in 96—97,
and one of the main criticisms was

1297
00:37:24.203 --> 00:37:27.078
and one of the main criticisms was
that it would be used by the

1298
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:30.203
that it would be used by the
nationalists as a vehicle for

1299
00:37:30.203 --> 00:37:30.370
nationalists as a vehida for
launching

1300
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.828
nationalists as a vehicle for
launching their own independence

1301
00:37:33.828 --> 00:37:35.662
launching their own independence
ambitions and, 20 years on, we are

1302
00:37:35.662 --> 00:37:36.912
ambitions and, 20 years on, we are
seeing the opportunism of the likes

1303
00:37:36.912 --> 00:37:38.328
seeing the opportunism of the likes
of Nicole Sturgeon, who have taken

1304
00:37:38.328 --> 00:37:40.537
of Nicola Sturgeon, who have taken
advantage of the situation and are

1305
00:37:40.537 --> 00:37:43.703
advantage of the situation and are
pushing an agenda which is far

1306
00:37:43.703 --> 00:37:46.745
pushing an agenda which is far
beyond what the devolution campaign

1307
00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:49.370
beyond what the devolution campaign
originally intended to achieve.

1308
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:56.037
originally intended to achieve.
Heather. I wanted to know are the

1309
00:37:56.037 --> 00:37:57.537
Heather. I wanted to know are the
SNP going to push for a referendum

1310
00:37:57.537 --> 00:37:59.245
SNP going to push for a referendum
next year or are you going to focus

1311
00:37:59.245 --> 00:38:02.287
next year or are you going to focus
on re—election first? Let me get

1312
00:38:02.287 --> 00:38:02.453
on re-elaction first? Let me get
round

1313
00:38:02.453 --> 00:38:04.412
on re-election first? Let me get
round the

1314
00:38:04.412 --> 00:38:05.120
on re—election first? Let me get
round the panel for

1315
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.495
on re—election first? Let me get
round the panel forJames, coming

1316
00:38:05.495 --> 00:38:05.870
round the panel for james, coming
back to

1317
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.912
round the panel forJames, coming
back to the question, has devolution

1318
00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:10.912
back to the question, has devolution
been a disaster? Will Boris’s remark

1319
00:38:10.912 --> 00:38:11.120
been a disaster? will Boris’s remark
increase

1320
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:11.995
been a disaster? Will Boris’s remark
increase the chance of Scotland

1321
00:38:11.995 --> 00:38:13.287
increase the chance of Scotland
breaking away from the UK? When you

1322
00:38:13.287 --> 00:38:13.703
breaking away from the UK? when you
heard reports

1323
00:38:13.703 --> 00:38:18.037
breaking away from the UK? When you
heard reports of this comment from

1324
00:38:18.037 --> 00:38:18.912
heard reports of this comment from
the Prime Minister, were you

1325
00:38:18.912 --> 00:38:20.745
the Prime Minister, were you
thinking, oh, no, what did you say

1326
00:38:20.745 --> 00:38:24.037
thinking, oh, no, what did you say
that for? Boris is a big fan of

1327
00:38:24.037 --> 00:38:24.995
that for? Boris is a big fan of
devolution, I know that from

1328
00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:28.953
devolution, I know that from
discussing it with him. How can he

1329
00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:29.453
discussing it with him. How ran he
be a fan

1330
00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:30.620
discussing it with him. How can he
be a fan and think it is a disaster?

1331
00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.953
be a fan and think it is a disaster?
They seem richly exclusive. I know

1332
00:38:34.953 --> 00:38:37.120
They seem richly exclusive. I know
this is the case because I worked

1333
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:37.495
this is the rase because I worked
with him

1334
00:38:37.495 --> 00:38:38.787
this is the case because I worked
with him in devolved government. He

1335
00:38:38.787 --> 00:38:39.953
with him in devolved government. He
is a passionate fan of devolution

1336
00:38:39.953 --> 00:38:41.495
is a passionate fan of devolution
and he understands the weight

1337
00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:42.495
and he understands the weight
devolved government works best is

1338
00:38:42.495 --> 00:38:47.828
devolved government works best is
when there is that devolved

1339
00:38:47.828 --> 00:38:48.412
when there is that devolved
administration, that devolved

1340
00:38:48.412 --> 00:38:50.287
administration, that devolved
government has both power but also

1341
00:38:50.287 --> 00:38:54.953
government has both power but also
responsibility. If you don’t mind me

1342
00:38:54.953 --> 00:38:56.203
responsibility. If you don’t mind me
saying, it seems a strange defence

1343
00:38:56.203 --> 00:39:01.412
saying, it seems a strange defence
of his comment... To say that he

1344
00:39:01.412 --> 00:39:02.703
of his comment... To say that he
said one thing but actually he means

1345
00:39:02.703 --> 00:39:07.745
said one thing but actually he means
the opposite. So...

1346
00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:08.287
said one thing but actually he means
the opposite. 50... Santa it’s hard

1347
00:39:08.287 --> 00:39:08.703
the opposite. So... Santa it’s hard
to believe

1348
00:39:08.703 --> 00:39:09.662
the opposite. 50... Santa it’s hard
to believe both things at the same

1349
00:39:09.662 --> 00:39:13.578
to believe both things at the same
time. The Prime Minister’s

1350
00:39:13.578 --> 00:39:15.162
time. The Prime Minister’s
experience as leader of a devolved

1351
00:39:15.162 --> 00:39:16.203
experience as leader of a devolved
administration, where he called for

1352
00:39:16.203 --> 00:39:16.328
administration, where he rallad for
more

1353
00:39:16.328 --> 00:39:17.578
administration, where he called for
more devolution for the city he ran

1354
00:39:17.578 --> 00:39:19.370
more devolution for the city he ran
as mayor but also more broadly, is

1355
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.578
as mayor but also more broadly, is
evidence it is a fan of devolution.

1356
00:39:21.578 --> 00:39:23.662
evidence it is a fan of devolution.
The real irony is there is only one

1357
00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:26.578
The real irony is there is only one
party in Westminster who is trying

1358
00:39:26.578 --> 00:39:27.745
party in Westminster who is trying
to scrap devolved government for

1359
00:39:27.745 --> 00:39:31.703
to scrap devolved government for
Scotland, and that’s the SNP. All

1360
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.162
Scotland, and that’s the SNP. All
the rest of us agree that devolved

1361
00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:35.412
the rest of us agree that devolved
government is a really good model.

1362
00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:37.162
government is a really good model.
The SNP are the ones trying to scrap

1363
00:39:37.162 --> 00:39:40.078
The SNP are the ones trying to scrap
devolved government. Fraser is

1364
00:39:40.078 --> 00:39:42.120
devolved government. Fraser is
absolutely right, Ian will debate

1365
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.745
absolutely right, Ian will debate
this constitutional stuff day in,

1366
00:39:46.745 --> 00:39:48.245
this constitutional stuff day in,
day out, because every minute we are

1367
00:39:48.245 --> 00:39:51.287
day out, because every minute we are
debating that we are not debating

1368
00:39:51.287 --> 00:39:53.745
debating that we are not debating
the catastrophic budget deficit in

1369
00:39:53.745 --> 00:39:54.537
the catastrophic budget deficit in
Scotland, the collapse of

1370
00:39:54.537 --> 00:39:56.162
Scotland, the collapse of
educational standards in Scotland,

1371
00:39:56.162 --> 00:39:59.787
educational standards in Scotland,
the appalling... We don’t have a

1372
00:39:59.787 --> 00:40:04.578
the appalling... We don’t have a
budget deficit. The appalling health

1373
00:40:04.578 --> 00:40:05.287
budget deficit. The appalling health
outcomes, the abysmal administration

1374
00:40:05.287 --> 00:40:07.162
outcomes, the abysmal administration
of the NHS in Scotland, the sick

1375
00:40:07.162 --> 00:40:10.995
of the NHS in Scotland, the sick
kids hospital with problems, the

1376
00:40:10.995 --> 00:40:12.078
kids hospital with problems, the
Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow,

1377
00:40:12.078 --> 00:40:15.495
Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow,
sill problems there, some of the

1378
00:40:15.495 --> 00:40:17.287
sill problems there, some of the
most appalling drug—related deaths

1379
00:40:17.287 --> 00:40:18.662
most appalling duly-related deaths
in Europe.

1380
00:40:18.662 --> 00:40:20.745
most appalling drug—related deaths
in Europe. Some pockets of poverty

1381
00:40:20.745 --> 00:40:22.453
in Europe. Some pockets of poverty
which would make other parts of the

1382
00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:29.537
which would make other parts of the
world shocked. Do you think the

1383
00:40:29.537 --> 00:40:30.620
world shocked. Do you think the
Prime Minister but comments will

1384
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.537
Prime Minister but comments will
increase the chance... That’s the

1385
00:40:31.537 --> 00:40:33.495
increase the chance... That’s the
question for the increase the chance

1386
00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:37.412
question for the increase the chance
of Scotland taking away? What I am

1387
00:40:37.412 --> 00:40:37.912
of Scotland taking away? what I am
not going to

1388
00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:39.370
of Scotland taking away? What I am
not going to do is to play into

1389
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:44.287
not going to do is to play into
Ian’s game. I am asking you to

1390
00:40:44.287 --> 00:40:46.412
Ian’s game. I am asking you to
answer the question put by the

1391
00:40:46.412 --> 00:40:47.120
answer the question put by the
audience, will Boris

1392
00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.787
answer the question put by the
audience, will BorisJohnson’s

1393
00:40:47.787 --> 00:40:47.995
audience, will Boris johnson’s
remark

1394
00:40:47.995 --> 00:40:48.745
audience, will BorisJohnson’s
remark increase the chance of

1395
00:40:48.745 --> 00:40:50.412
remark increase the chance of
Scotland breaking away from the UK?

1396
00:40:50.412 --> 00:40:54.495
Scotland breaking away from the UK?
I don’t think so. My point is, every

1397
00:40:54.495 --> 00:40:55.745
I don’t think so. My point is, every
minute we debate the issues Ian

1398
00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:57.120
minute we debate the issues Ian
would like us to debate, which are

1399
00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.828
would like us to debate, which are
these constitutional separatist

1400
00:40:59.828 --> 00:41:02.495
these constitutional separatist
issues, we are not debating the

1401
00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:04.203
issues, we are not debating the
things that government are meant to

1402
00:41:04.203 --> 00:41:06.287
things that government are meant to
be held accountable for, which is

1403
00:41:06.287 --> 00:41:06.912
be held accountabla for, which is
protection of

1404
00:41:06.912 --> 00:41:07.453
be held accountable for, which is
protection of the people, good

1405
00:41:07.453 --> 00:41:09.370
protection of the people, good
stewardship of the economy, how they

1406
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.745
stewardship of the economy, how they
deal with health and, on all those

1407
00:41:11.745 --> 00:41:12.453
deal with health and, on all those
metric, the

1408
00:41:12.453 --> 00:41:14.162
deal with health and, on all those
metrics, the SNP has been a disaster

1409
00:41:14.162 --> 00:41:14.495
metric, the SNP has been a disaster
for the

1410
00:41:14.495 --> 00:41:16.412
metrics, the SNP has been a disaster
for the Scottish people. I lived in

1411
00:41:16.412 --> 00:41:17.412
for the Scottish peopla. I lived in
Scotland, I

1412
00:41:17.412 --> 00:41:19.203
for the Scottish people. I lived in
Scotland, I love Scotland and the

1413
00:41:19.203 --> 00:41:20.287
Scotland, I love Scotland and the
Scots, and the SNP government has

1414
00:41:20.287 --> 00:41:21.370
Scots, and the SNP government has
provided a very poor political

1415
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.620
provided a very poor political
service for the Scots. To be fair,

1416
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.912
service for the Scots. To be fair,
there are things you pointed out

1417
00:41:25.912 --> 00:41:27.870
there are things you pointed out
that our terribly wrong in Scotland,

1418
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.578
that our terribly wrong in Scotland,
but if you go around England, there

1419
00:41:30.578 --> 00:41:31.662
but if you go around England, there
will be places with pockets of

1420
00:41:31.662 --> 00:41:33.162
will be places with pockets of
deprivation and all those things,

1421
00:41:33.162 --> 00:41:38.412
deprivation and all those things,
schools that are having huge

1422
00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:38.495
schools that are having huge
stmgglas

1423
00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:39.787
schools that are having huge
struggles in terms of how they

1424
00:41:39.787 --> 00:41:41.162
struggles in terms of how they
educate their children in those

1425
00:41:41.162 --> 00:41:41.495
educate their children in those
communities, so

1426
00:41:41.495 --> 00:41:41.703
educate their children in those
communities, sol

1427
00:41:41.703 --> 00:41:43.328
educate their children in those
communities, so I am not quite sure

1428
00:41:43.328 --> 00:41:43.787
communities, so I am not quite sure
we ran

1429
00:41:43.787 --> 00:41:45.203
communities, so I am not quite sure
we can throw that at the SNP. How

1430
00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:46.037
communities, so I am not quite sure
we can throw that at the SNP. Howl

1431
00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:46.412
we ran throw that at the SNP. How I
would like

1432
00:41:46.412 --> 00:41:48.870
we can throw that at the SNP. Howl
would like to approach this is to

1433
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:51.662
would like to approach this is to
say, think of a family. When you

1434
00:41:51.662 --> 00:41:52.870
say, think of a family. when you
think of a

1435
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.953
say, think of a family. When you
think of a family, you have your

1436
00:41:54.953 --> 00:41:56.787
think of a family, you have your
teenagers, your but in teenagers who

1437
00:41:56.787 --> 00:41:58.245
teenagers, your but in teenagers who
just on the brink of adulthood, and

1438
00:41:58.245 --> 00:42:00.245
just on the brink of adulthood, and
they are desperately wanting to be

1439
00:42:00.245 --> 00:42:02.495
they are desperately wanting to be
independent and free and do their

1440
00:42:02.495 --> 00:42:06.412
independent and free and do their
own thing, and I think that we are a

1441
00:42:06.412 --> 00:42:09.037
own thing, and I think that we are a
mature democracy and we have got to

1442
00:42:09.037 --> 00:42:15.162
mature democracy and we have got to
find a way of enabling the family,

1443
00:42:15.162 --> 00:42:16.620
find a way of enabling the family,
because that’s what we are in the

1444
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.578
because that’s what we are in the
United Kingdom, 3 family, to

1445
00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:19.578
United Kingdom, a family, to
ﬂourish,

1446
00:42:19.578 --> 00:42:23.578
United Kingdom, 3 family, to
flourish, to fly and flourish. So I

1447
00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:23.870
ﬂourish, to ﬂy and ﬂourish. So I
hope it

1448
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.870
flourish, to fly and flourish. So I
hope it doesn’t actually increase

1449
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.370
hope it doesn’t actually increase
the chances of a kind of breaking

1450
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.662
the chances of a kind of breaking
away that says we are no longer

1451
00:42:30.662 --> 00:42:33.828
away that says we are no longer
family again. I actually personally

1452
00:42:33.828 --> 00:42:36.412
family again. I actually personally
love the idea of the United Kingdom.

1453
00:42:36.412 --> 00:42:38.703
love the idea of the United Kingdom.
I love the idea of the one world,

1454
00:42:38.703 --> 00:42:42.162
I love the idea of the one world,
and I want to see people around the

1455
00:42:42.162 --> 00:42:43.578
and I want to see peopla around the
world

1456
00:42:43.578 --> 00:42:45.912
and I want to see people around the
world flourishing. We have got to

1457
00:42:45.912 --> 00:42:46.495
world ﬂourishing. We have got to
find a way

1458
00:42:46.495 --> 00:42:47.620
world flourishing. We have got to
find a way not to have political

1459
00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.620
find a way not to have political
domination but enabling, respecting,

1460
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:56.120
domination but enabling, respecting,
in a democratic society. We have to

1461
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.578
in a democratic society. We have to
respect that part of the family that

1462
00:42:58.578 --> 00:43:00.662
respect that part of the family that
says, actually, I want to do it in

1463
00:43:00.662 --> 00:43:02.370
says, actually, I want to do it in
this way. I will still be part of

1464
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.328
this way. I will still be part of
the family, and we have got to find

1465
00:43:04.328 --> 00:43:04.453
the family, and we have got to find
“75

1466
00:43:04.453 --> 00:43:07.745
the family, and we have got to find
ways of accommodating that. Let’s

1467
00:43:07.745 --> 00:43:12.412
ways of accommodating that. Let’s
take a question from Martin McMahon

1468
00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:13.953
take a question from Martin McMahon
stop following the EHRC report

1469
00:43:13.953 --> 00:43:15.412
stop following the EHRC report
stating Labour had broken the law

1470
00:43:15.412 --> 00:43:15.703
stating labour had broken the law
and jeremy

1471
00:43:15.703 --> 00:43:16.537
stating Labour had broken the law
and Jeremy Corbyn’s recently in

and jeremy Corbyn’s recently in
Scotland,

1473
00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:16.995
and Jeremy Corbyn’s recently in
Scotland, has

00:43:16.995 --> 00:43:18.412
and Jeremy Corbyn’s recently in
Scotland, hasjust been

and Jeremy Corbyn’s recently in

Scotland, hasjust been restored in
the Labour Party by Keir Starmer or

1479
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.162
the Labour Party by Keir Starmer or
undermined? ——

1480
00:43:24.162 --> 00:43:24.370
the Labour Party by Keir Starmer or
undermined? ——Jeremy

1481
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:24.495
the Labour Party by Keir Starmer or
undermined? —— Jeremy Corbyn’s

1482
00:43:24.495 --> 00:43:24.703
undermined? -- jeremy Corbyn’s
recent

1483
00:43:24.703 --> 00:43:29.662
undermined? —— Jeremy Corbyn’s
recent reinstatement. I was shocked

1484
00:43:29.662 --> 00:43:32.703
recent reinstatement. I was shocked
by the events of the last few days.

1485
00:43:32.703 --> 00:43:40.078
by the events of the last few days.
We were told, initially, we were

1486
00:43:40.078 --> 00:43:41.537
We were told, initially, we were
told that Keir Starmer had made the

1487
00:43:41.537 --> 00:43:44.120
told that Keir Starmer had made the
decision to suspend Jeremy Corbyn,

1488
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.912
decision to suspend jeremy Corbyn,
and it

1489
00:43:44.912 --> 00:43:46.203
decision to suspend Jeremy Corbyn,
and it turned out he hadn’t made the

1490
00:43:46.203 --> 00:43:49.287
and it turned out he hadn’t made the
decision, and then it seemed the

1491
00:43:49.287 --> 00:43:50.537
decision, and then it seemed the
decision was made around him to

1492
00:43:50.537 --> 00:43:53.037
decision was made around him to
reinstate, so he was talking tough

1493
00:43:53.037 --> 00:43:54.412
reinstate, so he was talking tough
but there seem to be real gaps

1494
00:43:54.412 --> 00:43:55.745
but there seem to be real gaps
between the rhetoric and the

1495
00:43:55.745 --> 00:43:58.037
between the rhetoric and the
performance. Going into the last

1496
00:43:58.037 --> 00:44:01.578
performance. Going into the last
general election, I had friends of

1497
00:44:01.578 --> 00:44:02.078
general election, I had friends of
mine, jewish

1498
00:44:02.078 --> 00:44:04.995
general election, I had friends of
mine, Jewish friends of mine express

1499
00:44:04.995 --> 00:44:07.453
mine, jewish friends of mine express
genuine fear

1500
00:44:07.453 --> 00:44:10.870
mine, Jewish friends of mine express
genuine fear about a Labour

1501
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:12.412
genuine fear about a Labour
government, and I had hoped that the

1502
00:44:12.412 --> 00:44:15.828
government, and I had hoped that the
change in leadership would have seen

1503
00:44:15.828 --> 00:44:18.662
change in leadership would have seen
the problems of anti—Semitism, which

1504
00:44:18.662 --> 00:44:18.912
the problams of anti-Semitism, which
had

1505
00:44:18.912 --> 00:44:19.162
the problems of anti-Semitism, which
had seemingly

1506
00:44:19.162 --> 00:44:20.828
the problems of anti—Semitism, which
had seemingly crept into many, many

1507
00:44:20.828 --> 00:44:22.662
had seemingly crept into many, many
parts of the Labour Party, dealt

1508
00:44:22.662 --> 00:44:28.078
parts of the labour Party, dealt
with, and it

1509
00:44:28.912 --> 00:44:31.328
with, and it seems that, you know,
Keir Starmer, and I have no doubt

1510
00:44:31.328 --> 00:44:33.370
Keir Starmer, and I have no doubt
that his intentions are noble, but

1511
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.495
that his intentions are noble, but
he is displaying weakness on this

1512
00:44:34.495 --> 00:44:37.495
he is displaying weakness on this
issue. He needs to make it

1513
00:44:37.495 --> 00:44:38.787
issue. He needs to make it
absolutely clear that there is no

1514
00:44:38.787 --> 00:44:40.162
absolutely clear that there is no
place in the Labour Party or,

1515
00:44:40.162 --> 00:44:40.495
place in the labour Party or,
indeed, to

1516
00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:43.453
place in the Labour Party or,
indeed, to politics at all for

1517
00:44:43.453 --> 00:44:44.787
indeed, to politics at all for
anti—Semitism and he needs to act in

1518
00:44:44.787 --> 00:44:45.037
anti-Semitism and he needs to act in
accordance

1519
00:44:45.037 --> 00:44:46.037
anti—Semitism and he needs to act in
accordance with those words and, at

1520
00:44:46.037 --> 00:44:49.953
accordance with those words and, at
the moment, and actions don’t align.

1521
00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:50.912
the moment, and actions don’t align.
Contemporary do you mean there

1522
00:44:50.912 --> 00:44:52.328
Contemporary do you mean there
should be no place in the Labour

1523
00:44:52.328 --> 00:44:52.703
should be no place in the labour
Party for

1524
00:44:52.703 --> 00:44:58.745
should be no place in the Labour
Party forJeremy Corbyn? I think the

1525
00:44:58.745 --> 00:44:58.828
Party for jeremy Corbyn? I think the
original

1526
00:44:58.828 --> 00:44:59.828
Party forJeremy Corbyn? I think the
original decision was right. I think

1527
00:44:59.828 --> 00:45:01.245
original decision was right. I think
the report was damning. I think

1528
00:45:01.245 --> 00:45:02.287
the report was damning. I think
jeremy

1529
00:45:02.287 --> 00:45:04.703
the report was damning. I think
Jeremy Corbyn’s response was

1530
00:45:04.703 --> 00:45:05.578
jeremy Corbyn’s response was
shocking,

1531
00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:08.745
Jeremy Corbyn’s response was
shocking, shockingly inappropriate.

1532
00:45:08.745 --> 00:45:09.912
shocking, shockingly inappropriate.
I felt very uncomfortable that there

1533
00:45:09.912 --> 00:45:11.495
I felt very uncomfortable that there
were so many members of the Labour

1534
00:45:11.495 --> 00:45:12.370
were so many members of the labour
Party who could

1535
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:13.203
were so many members of the Labour
Party who could see exactly what the

1536
00:45:13.203 --> 00:45:14.787
Party who could see exactly what the
rest of us could see and yet were

1537
00:45:14.787 --> 00:45:18.162
rest of us could see and yet were
trying very, very hard to make him

1538
00:45:18.162 --> 00:45:19.537
trying very, very hard to make him
Prime Minister of the UK in December

1539
00:45:19.537 --> 00:45:24.120
Prime Minister of the UK in December
of last year and, as I say, I hope

1540
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.620
of last year and, as I say, I hope
Keir Starmer at the opportunity to

1541
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.120
Keir Starmer at the opportunity to
draw a line under it, and he has

1542
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.328
draw a line under it, and he has
failed.

1543
00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:30.787
draw a line under it, and he has
failad. (“an I

00:45:34.162 --> 00:45:36.578
senior member of the Labour Party
ought to, with something personal?

1549
00:45:36.578 --> 00:45:37.453
ought to, with something personal?
when I began

1550
00:45:37.453 --> 00:45:39.495
ought to, with something personal?
When I began to first see the cancer

1551
00:45:39.495 --> 00:45:41.287
when I began to first see the cancer
of

1552
00:45:41.287 --> 00:45:41.912
When I began to first see the cancer
of anti—Semitism growing and

1553
00:45:41.912 --> 00:45:42.120
of anti-Semitism growing and
becoming

1554
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.537
of anti—Semitism growing and
becoming more apparent in the Labour

1555
00:45:44.537 --> 00:45:45.537
becoming more apparent in the labour
Party, |

1556
00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:45.953
becoming more apparent in the labour
Party, Ithought

1557
00:45:45.953 --> 00:45:46.162
becoming more apparent in the labour
Party, Ithoughtl

1558
00:45:46.162 --> 00:45:46.995
becoming more apparent in the Labour
Party, I thought I was doing the

1559
00:45:46.995 --> 00:45:48.412
Party, I thought I was doing the
right things. I was calling it out

1560
00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:50.370
right things. I was calling it out
in Shadow Cabinet, I was speaking to

1561
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.912
in Shadow Cabinet, I was speaking to
the leadership, I was speaking out

1562
00:45:51.912 --> 00:45:53.787
the leadership, I was speaking out
in public, I put it in a large part

1563
00:45:53.787 --> 00:45:55.495
in public, I put it in a large part
of my conference speech, and I

1564
00:45:55.495 --> 00:45:56.912
of my conference speech, and I
thought I was doing all that I

1565
00:45:56.912 --> 00:46:00.412
thought I was doing all that I
could. And then I saw the EHRC

1566
00:46:00.412 --> 00:46:01.870
could. And then I saw the EHRC
report, and I was profoundly

1567
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:05.078
report, and I was profoundly
ashamed. I was profoundly ashamed

1568
00:46:05.078 --> 00:46:07.495
ashamed. I was profoundly ashamed
that this had happened and, even

1569
00:46:07.495 --> 00:46:09.328
that this had happened and, even
though I thought that I had done all

1570
00:46:09.328 --> 00:46:10.453
though I thought that I had done all
I could in the circumstances, I

1571
00:46:10.453 --> 00:46:10.620
I could in the circumstances, I
dearty

1572
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.162
I could in the circumstances, I
clearly should have done more. I am

1573
00:46:14.162 --> 00:46:14.495
dearty should have done more. I am
not sure

1574
00:46:14.495 --> 00:46:15.578
clearly should have done more. I am
not sure what I should, but there

1575
00:46:15.578 --> 00:46:16.120
not sure what I should, but there
was due

1576
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.162
not sure what I should, but there
was clue more that could have been

1577
00:46:17.162 --> 00:46:17.703
was due more that could have been
done, and I

1578
00:46:17.703 --> 00:46:19.453
was clue more that could have been
done, and I think that anybody

1579
00:46:19.453 --> 00:46:20.787
done, and I think that anybody
responsible in the leadership of the

1580
00:46:20.787 --> 00:46:21.120
responsible in the leadership of the
labour Party

1581
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:21.912
responsible in the leadership of the
Labour Party should have the same

1582
00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.328
labour Party should have the same
reaction.

1583
00:46:24.328 --> 00:46:25.953
Labour Party should have the same
reaction. When you say you are not

1584
00:46:25.953 --> 00:46:26.537
reaction. when you say you are not
sure how you

1585
00:46:26.537 --> 00:46:30.578
reaction. When you say you are not
sure how you could do more, do you

1586
00:46:30.578 --> 00:46:31.745
sure how you could do more, do you
mean that promoting Jeremy Corbyn as

1587
00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:32.203
mean that promoting jeremy Corbyn as
the next

1588
00:46:32.203 --> 00:46:33.370
mean that promoting Jeremy Corbyn as
the next leader of this country, you

1589
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.662
the next leader of this country, you
were one of those people? Let me

1590
00:46:36.662 --> 00:46:38.412
were one of those people? Let me
answer the first bit and then I will

1591
00:46:38.412 --> 00:46:41.245
answer the first bit and then I will
answer the next bit. What I was

1592
00:46:41.245 --> 00:46:42.120
answer the next bit. what I was
saying that I

1593
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.912
answer the next bit. What I was
saying that I think my feelings of

1594
00:46:42.912 --> 00:46:45.745
saying that I think my feelings of
contrition, and my feelings that we

1595
00:46:45.745 --> 00:46:46.953
contrition, and my feelings that we
had to adopt everything that the

1596
00:46:46.953 --> 00:46:48.120
had to adopt everything that the
EHRC was saying was absolutely the

1597
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.745
EHRC was saying was absolutely the
right reaction, and it was the

1598
00:46:52.745 --> 00:46:54.495
right reaction, and it was the
reaction of Keir Starmer, and I was

1599
00:46:54.495 --> 00:46:55.120
reaction of Keir Starmer, and I was
very disappointed that

1600
00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:55.453
reaction of Keir Starmer, and I was
very disappointed thatJeremy didn’t

1601
00:46:55.453 --> 00:46:55.912
very disappointed that jeremy didn’t
seem to

1602
00:46:55.912 --> 00:46:58.662
very disappointed thatJeremy didn’t
seem to have the same reaction. I am

1603
00:46:58.662 --> 00:47:00.662
seem to have the same reaction. I am
not going to make comments about

1604
00:47:00.662 --> 00:47:02.120
not going to make comments about
disciplinary processes because, in

1605
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.745
disciplinary processes because, in
the end, it is right the EHRC said

1606
00:47:03.745 --> 00:47:05.328
the end, it is right the EHRC said
it should be done at arms length and

1607
00:47:05.328 --> 00:47:05.703
it should be done at arms langth and
it would

1608
00:47:05.703 --> 00:47:06.912
it should be done at arms length and
it would be right for me to make

1609
00:47:06.912 --> 00:47:09.120
it would be right for me to make
direct comments in relation to that.

1610
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.953
direct comments in relation to that.
But that is how we have got to where

1611
00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:14.328
But that is how we have got to where
we are. Now, what I write to promote

1612
00:47:14.328 --> 00:47:15.203
we are. Now, what I write to promote
jeremy and to try

1613
00:47:15.203 --> 00:47:15.912
we are. Now, what I write to promote
Jeremy and to try to get him into

1614
00:47:15.912 --> 00:47:16.120
jeremy and to try to get him into
Number

1615
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.370
Jeremy and to try to get him into
Number Ten? Absolutely,

1616
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.537
Jeremy and to try to get him into
NumberTen? Absolutely, I

1617
00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:19.870
Jeremy and to try to get him into
Number Ten? Absolutely, Iwas

1618
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.120
Number Ten? Absolutely, Iwas
because, I tell you this, I

1619
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.870
Number Ten? Absolutely, Iwas
because, Itell you this, I have

1620
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:22.370
because, I tell you this, I have
known jeremy

1621
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:22.537
because, Itell you this, I have
known Jeremy for

1622
00:47:22.537 --> 00:47:22.870
because, Itell you this, I have
knownJeremy for a

1623
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:23.703
because, Itell you this, I have
known Jeremy for a long time,

1624
00:47:23.703 --> 00:47:23.953
because, Itell you this, I have
knownJeremy for a long time, more

1625
00:47:23.953 --> 00:47:25.120
known jeremy for a long time, more
than 15 years. He

1626
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.912
knownJeremy for a long time, more
than 15 years. He is a neighbouring

1627
00:47:25.912 --> 00:47:27.662
than 15 years. He is a neighbouring
constituency MP to me and I believe,

1628
00:47:27.662 --> 00:47:29.662
constituency MP to me and I believe,
if he had been Prime Minister, he

1629
00:47:29.662 --> 00:47:30.870
if he had been Prime Minister, he
would have been radical, he would

1630
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:31.870
would have been radical, he would
have been profoundly kind and

1631
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.495
have been profoundly kind and
profoundly principled. He had

1632
00:47:35.495 --> 00:47:37.287
profoundly principled. He had
shortcomings and one of the

1633
00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.620
shortcomings and one of the
shortcomings, in my view, and I have

1634
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.120
shortcomings, in my view, and I have
said this before, that he allowed

1635
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.037
said this before, that he allowed
his own personal feelings,

1636
00:47:43.037 --> 00:47:43.328
said this before, that he allowed
his own personalfeelings, whereby

1637
00:47:43.328 --> 00:47:44.203
his own personal feelings, whereby
he felt

1638
00:47:44.203 --> 00:47:44.995
his own personalfeelings, whereby
he felt he was personally under

1639
00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:45.995
he felt he was personally under
attack on the issue of

1640
00:47:45.995 --> 00:47:49.162
attack on the issue of
anti—Semitism, so he wasn’t able to

1641
00:47:49.162 --> 00:47:49.662
anti-Semitism, so he wasn’t able to
step back and

1642
00:47:49.662 --> 00:47:50.912
anti—Semitism, so he wasn’t able to
step back and take an objective view

1643
00:47:50.912 --> 00:47:52.995
step back and take an objective view
of it and make the proper decisions,

1644
00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:54.412
of it and make the proper decisions,
and that was a profound weakness and

1645
00:47:54.412 --> 00:47:56.953
and that was a profound weakness and
it’s something that he knows, that’s

1646
00:47:56.953 --> 00:48:01.870
it’s something that he knows, that’s
what I think, because I told him.

1647
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:05.828
You know him better than anybody
else in this room, so do you think

1648
00:48:05.828 --> 00:48:08.745
else in this room, so do you think
he will apologise for what the EHRC

1649
00:48:08.745 --> 00:48:10.787
he will apologise for what the EHRC
called the failures of leadership in

1650
00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:10.912
railed the failures of leadership in
addressing

1651
00:48:10.912 --> 00:48:12.120
called the failures of leadership in
addressing anti—Semitism? Well, I

1652
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:12.370
addressing anti-Semitism? Well, I
don’t

1653
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:15.912
addressing anti—Semitism? Well, I
don’t know. I don’t think it’s right

1654
00:48:15.912 --> 00:48:17.287
don’t know. I don’t think it’s right
for me to speculate. I certainly

1655
00:48:17.287 --> 00:48:19.162
for me to speculate. I certainly
hope he does, and I certainly hope

1656
00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:21.995
hope he does, and I certainly hope
he takes the opportunity to think

1657
00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:23.912
he takes the opportunity to think
through why we are where we are and

1658
00:48:23.912 --> 00:48:25.995
through why we are where we are and
what it is that I personally think

1659
00:48:25.995 --> 00:48:29.287
what it is that I personally think
you should do. But, you know, we

1660
00:48:29.287 --> 00:48:32.412
you should do. But, you know, we
need to move on. We need to own this

1661
00:48:32.412 --> 00:48:34.370
need to move on. We need to own this
problem, find a solution and we must

1662
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.703
problam, find a solution and we must
move on.

1663
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:35.745
problem, find a solution and we must
move on. The country needs an

1664
00:48:35.745 --> 00:48:37.787
move on. The country needs an
opposition that is ready to step

1665
00:48:37.787 --> 00:48:39.912
opposition that is ready to step
into government because, frankly, we

1666
00:48:39.912 --> 00:48:40.370
into government because, frankly, we
ran do

1667
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:45.287
into government because, frankly, we
can do without this lot. That is

1668
00:48:45.287 --> 00:48:45.495
ran do without this lot. That is
absolutely

1669
00:48:45.495 --> 00:48:46.828
can do without this lot. That is
absolutely shocking. How much

1670
00:48:46.828 --> 00:48:50.120
absolutely shocking. How much
evidence do you need? He spent

1671
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:56.078
evidence do you need? He spent
decades associating with 9/11 truth

1672
00:48:56.078 --> 00:48:58.370
decades associating with 9/11 truth
is and Holocaust deniers on the idea

1673
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.412
is and Holocaust deniers on the idea
that this was too hard to see and

1674
00:49:00.412 --> 00:49:02.662
that this was too hard to see and
that even with the evidence

1675
00:49:02.662 --> 00:49:04.453
that even with the evidence
prevented by the report, you are

1676
00:49:04.453 --> 00:49:06.537
prevented by the report, you are
still here saying you do not regret

1677
00:49:06.537 --> 00:49:08.328
still here saying you do not regret
trying to install him as Prime

1678
00:49:08.328 --> 00:49:11.995
trying to install him as Prime
Minister of this country. It is

1679
00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:13.120
Minister of this country. It is
genuinely shocking. Jeremy Corbyn

1680
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:13.495
genuinely shocking. jeremy Corbyn
has spent

1681
00:49:13.495 --> 00:49:16.745
genuinely shocking. Jeremy Corbyn
has spent his life fighting racism

1682
00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:17.745
has spent his life fighting racism
in this country. He demonstrably

1683
00:49:17.745 --> 00:49:21.995
in this country. He demonstrably
hasn’t. And that is what he has

1684
00:49:21.995 --> 00:49:25.453
hasn’t. And that is what he has
done. As I say, I have been not

1685
00:49:25.453 --> 00:49:27.495
done. As I say, I have been not
trying to score points, I have been,

1686
00:49:27.495 --> 00:49:29.912
trying to score points, I have been,
in my view, as honest and open as I

1687
00:49:29.912 --> 00:49:31.370
in my view, as honest and open as I
possibly ran be

1688
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.203
in my view, as honest and open as I
possibly can be on this very

1689
00:49:32.203 --> 00:49:33.912
possibly can be on this very
difficult issue, and I hope people

1690
00:49:33.912 --> 00:49:34.037
difficult issue, and I hope peopla
hear

1691
00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.828
difficult issue, and I hope people
hear what it is that I’m saying.

1692
00:49:35.828 --> 00:49:42.412
hear what it is that I’m saying.
Richard? I’m completely shocked and

1693
00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:45.078
Richard? I’m completely shocked and
when Keir Starmer came to power, I

1694
00:49:45.078 --> 00:49:45.412
when Keir Starmer fame to power, I
thought he

1695
00:49:45.412 --> 00:49:47.287
when Keir Starmer came to power, I
thought he would be dealing with

1696
00:49:47.287 --> 00:49:47.412
thought he would be dealing with
jeremy

1697
00:49:47.412 --> 00:49:50.370
thought he would be dealing with
Jeremy Corbyn better and he

1698
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:50.453
jeremy Corbyn better and he
encouraged

1699
00:49:50.453 --> 00:49:51.828
Jeremy Corbyn better and he
encouraged me very much when I saw

1700
00:49:51.828 --> 00:49:53.953
encouraged me very much when I saw
what he did at the beginning and he

1701
00:49:53.953 --> 00:49:54.412
what he did at the beginning and he
gave jeremy

1702
00:49:54.412 --> 00:49:54.662
what he did at the beginning and he
gavejeremy Corbyn

1703
00:49:54.662 --> 00:49:54.912
what he did at the beginning and he
gave Jeremy Corbyn the

1704
00:49:54.912 --> 00:49:55.078
what he did at the beginning and he
gaveJeremy Corbyn the opportunity

1705
00:49:55.078 --> 00:49:55.787
gave jeremy Corbyn the opportunity
to apologise

1706
00:49:55.787 --> 00:49:56.203
gavejeremy Corbyn the opportunity
to apologise and he

1707
00:49:56.203 --> 00:49:57.412
gaveJeremy Corbyn the opportunity
to apologise and he never did, and I

1708
00:49:57.412 --> 00:49:58.870
to apologise and he never did, and I
just cannot believe that this man

1709
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.078
just cannot believe that this man
could have rose to a position of

1710
00:50:01.078 --> 00:50:01.787
could have rose to a position of
almost being a

1711
00:50:01.787 --> 00:50:03.495
could have rose to a position of
almost being 3 Prime Minister of our

1712
00:50:03.495 --> 00:50:04.203
almost being a Prime Minister of our
country, and I’m

1713
00:50:04.203 --> 00:50:07.703
almost being 3 Prime Minister of our
country, and I’m really shocked in

1714
00:50:07.703 --> 00:50:09.412
country, and I’m really shocked in
the way of his attitude and

1715
00:50:09.412 --> 00:50:10.703
the way of his attitude and
behaviour and he can’t apologise for

1716
00:50:10.703 --> 00:50:13.203
behaviour and he can’t apologise for
the things he has done. It is

1717
00:50:13.203 --> 00:50:14.828
the things he has done. It is
shocking. My father survived the

1718
00:50:14.828 --> 00:50:17.703
shocking. My father survived the
Holocaust, he is 98 years old, and

1719
00:50:17.703 --> 00:50:20.370
Holocaust, he is 98 years old, and
what he went through and everything

1720
00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:21.662
what he went through and everything
that happened is unbelievable and I

1721
00:50:21.662 --> 00:50:25.578
that happened is unbelievable and I
am shocked that he is back in the

1722
00:50:25.578 --> 00:50:25.787
am shocked that he is back in the
party-

1723
00:50:25.787 --> 00:50:27.662
am shocked that he is back in the
party. He should be nowhere near any

1724
00:50:27.662 --> 00:50:30.120
party. He should be nowhere near any
position of any power. I am really,

1725
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.162
position of any power. I am really,
really upset about the way that has

1726
00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.912
really upset about the way that has
been dealt with and I think it

1727
00:50:33.912 --> 00:50:35.328
been dealt with and I think it
should be much stronger than what

1728
00:50:35.328 --> 00:50:35.828
should be much stronger than what
has happened. I

1729
00:50:35.828 --> 00:50:38.037
should be much stronger than what
has happened. Ijust wanted to say

1730
00:50:38.037 --> 00:50:42.328
has happened. Ijust wanted to say
that with anti—Semitism. And

1731
00:50:42.328 --> 00:50:42.412
that with anti-Semitism. And
everything

1732
00:50:42.412 --> 00:50:44.828
that with anti—Semitism. And
everything around it and Jeremy

1733
00:50:44.828 --> 00:50:46.703
everything around it and jeremy
Corbyn

1734
00:50:46.703 --> 00:50:48.370
everything around it and Jeremy
Corbyn being there throughout this,

1735
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.412
Corbyn being there throughout this,
there are loads of other prejudices

1736
00:50:50.412 --> 00:50:52.287
there are loads of other prejudices
going on and it is becoming

1737
00:50:52.287 --> 00:50:54.870
going on and it is becoming
systemic. I think going forward, we

1738
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.370
systemic. I think going forward, we
need to know how to deal with these

1739
00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.120
need to know how to deal with these
issues and leave the past where it

1740
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.870
issues and leave the past where it
is and make sure these things are

1741
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.370
is and make sure these things are
not done going forward, so what

1742
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.328
not done going forward, so what
steps are being taken to ensure

1743
00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.787
steps are being taken to ensure
incidents and actions such as this

1744
00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:09.203
incidents and actions such as this
are not going on going forward? We

1745
00:51:09.203 --> 00:51:11.245
are not going on going forward? We
will get round the rest of the panel

1746
00:51:11.245 --> 00:51:11.953
will get round the rest of the panel
if I may.

1747
00:51:11.953 --> 00:51:13.037
will get round the rest of the panel
ifI may. Fraser?

1748
00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:14.620
will get round the rest of the panel
if I may. Fraser? I have to say I

1749
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.328
if I may. Fraser? I have to say I
think Keir Starmer has been pretty

1750
00:51:16.328 --> 00:51:18.328
think Keir Starmer has been pretty
decisive over this. He has not

1751
00:51:18.328 --> 00:51:19.578
decisive over this. He has not
allowed Jeremy Corbyn comeback as a

1752
00:51:19.578 --> 00:51:19.787
allowed jeremy Corbyn comeback as a
labour

1753
00:51:19.787 --> 00:51:23.120
allowed Jeremy Corbyn comeback as a
Labour MP and he does not have the

1754
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:23.495
labour MP and he does not have the
whip restored

1755
00:51:23.495 --> 00:51:24.453
Labour MP and he does not have the
whip restored and Keir Starmer is

1756
00:51:24.453 --> 00:51:25.953
whip restored and Keir Starmer is
facing pressure from his party

1757
00:51:25.953 --> 00:51:27.203
facing pressure from his party
saying they will resign if

1758
00:51:27.203 --> 00:51:27.412
facing pressure from his party
saying they will resign ifJeremy

1759
00:51:27.412 --> 00:51:27.495
saying they will resign if jeremy
Corbyn

1760
00:51:27.495 --> 00:51:29.328
saying they will resign ifJeremy
Corbyn doesn’t get the whip and he’s

1761
00:51:29.328 --> 00:51:32.953
Corbyn doesn’t get the whip and he’s
not moving an inch, so here’s an

1762
00:51:32.953 --> 00:51:34.828
not moving an inch, so here’s an
instance where I am no natural

1763
00:51:34.828 --> 00:51:36.370
instance where I am no natural
labour supporter but I’ve been

1764
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:38.953
labour supporter but I’ve been
pretty impressed at the way Keir

1765
00:51:38.953 --> 00:51:40.453
pretty impressed at the way Keir
Starmer has followed through on what

1766
00:51:40.453 --> 00:51:42.912
Starmer has followed through on what
he has said. He really wants to

1767
00:51:42.912 --> 00:51:44.953
he has said. He really wants to
demonstrate, and needs to

1768
00:51:44.953 --> 00:51:46.328
demonstrate, and needs to
demonstrate, that the Labour Party

1769
00:51:46.328 --> 00:51:47.453
demonstrate, that the labour Party
is, in his

1770
00:51:47.453 --> 00:51:48.412
demonstrate, that the Labour Party
is, in his words, under new

1771
00:51:48.412 --> 00:51:50.078
is, in his words, under new
management and I’m not sure you can

1772
00:51:50.078 --> 00:51:50.870
management and I’m not sure you ran
fault him so

1773
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:51.995
management and I’m not sure you can
fault him so far in the leadership

1774
00:51:51.995 --> 00:51:54.412
fault him so far in the leadership
he has shown over this. If I were

1775
00:51:54.412 --> 00:51:54.870
he has shown over this. If I were
james Cleverty

1776
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:56.412
he has shown over this. If I were
James Cleverly I would be a bit

1777
00:51:56.412 --> 00:51:56.578
james Cleverty I would be a bit
nervous

1778
00:51:56.578 --> 00:51:58.162
James Cleverly I would be a bit
nervous because he is looking a bit

1779
00:51:58.162 --> 00:51:59.912
nervous because he is looking a bit
like the young Tony Blair taking on

1780
00:51:59.912 --> 00:52:01.703
like the young Tony Blair taking on
his militant wing and showing the

1781
00:52:01.703 --> 00:52:03.120
his militant wing and showing the
country that his party has changed

1782
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.995
country that his party has changed
and is ready for election. What has

1783
00:52:06.995 --> 00:52:07.412
and is ready for election. what has
happened in

1784
00:52:07.412 --> 00:52:10.453
and is ready for election. What has
happened in the Corbyn era was a

1785
00:52:10.453 --> 00:52:11.912
happened in the Corbyn era was a
calamity, but it seems like Keir

1786
00:52:11.912 --> 00:52:13.537
calamity, but it seems like Keir
Starmer realises that Andy is doing

1787
00:52:13.537 --> 00:52:14.912
Starmer realises that Andy is doing
as much as you could reasonably

1788
00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:20.245
as much as you could reasonably
expect him to do to move on. The

1789
00:52:20.245 --> 00:52:23.787
expect him to do to move on. The
EHRC published a report which, by

1790
00:52:23.787 --> 00:52:26.828
EHRC published a report which, by
all means, is a challenging one. And

1791
00:52:26.828 --> 00:52:27.037
all means, is a challanging one. And
what

1792
00:52:27.037 --> 00:52:29.828
all means, is a challenging one. And
what we have reduced it to since it

1793
00:52:29.828 --> 00:52:32.203
what we have reduced it to since it
has been published has become

1794
00:52:32.203 --> 00:52:36.787
has been published has become
something between the leader and the

1795
00:52:36.787 --> 00:52:38.537
something between the leader and the
ex leader. It has become

1796
00:52:38.537 --> 00:52:42.120
ex leader. It has become
exceptionally personalised, and I’m

1797
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.620
exceptionally personalised, and I’m
terribly disappointed about that. I

1798
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:49.537
terribly disappointed about that. I
feel personally that we all bear the

1799
00:52:49.537 --> 00:52:54.078
feel personally that we all bear the
shame of what this report is

1800
00:52:54.078 --> 00:52:55.412
shame of what this report is
emphasising. We all bear the shame

1801
00:52:55.412 --> 00:52:58.495
emphasising. We all bear the shame
of it. Discrimination of any kind,

1802
00:52:58.495 --> 00:53:03.537
of it. Discrimination of any kind,
whether it is anti—Semitic, in

1803
00:53:03.537 --> 00:53:03.703
whether it is anti-Semitic, in
relation

1804
00:53:03.703 --> 00:53:04.495
whether it is anti—Semitic, in
relation to black people, whether

1805
00:53:04.495 --> 00:53:06.037
relation to black peopla, whether
it’s in

1806
00:53:06.037 --> 00:53:07.245
relation to black people, whether
it’s in relation to gay people, is

1807
00:53:07.245 --> 00:53:12.037
it’s in relation to gay people, is
unacceptable in our society. And why

1808
00:53:12.037 --> 00:53:14.078
unacceptable in our society. And why
we are staying with this being

1809
00:53:14.078 --> 00:53:16.203
we are staying with this being
personalised, should he be in and

1810
00:53:16.203 --> 00:53:17.870
personalised, should he be in and
out of the party, is Keir Starmer

1811
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.495
out of the party, is Keir Starmer
the big guy doing the right thing,

1812
00:53:19.495 --> 00:53:21.953
the big guy doing the right thing,
we are missing the point. Please,

1813
00:53:21.953 --> 00:53:27.662
we are missing the point. Please,
let’s get back to what the

1814
00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:28.870
let’s get back to what the
recommendations are and implement

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.412
recommendations are and implement
the recommendations. I want my

1816
00:53:30.412 --> 00:53:32.245
the recommendations. I want my
children to grow up in a society

1817
00:53:32.245 --> 00:53:34.912
children to grow up in a society
where we do not label people,

1818
00:53:34.912 --> 00:53:39.120
where we do not label people,
discriminate against them, kneel on

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.662
giving what you have said of
repeating the question to Ian, but I

it, which was, in fairness, has

trust been restored in the Labour

1836

Party by Keir

1837
00:54:02.995 --> 00:54:05.870
trust been restored in the Labour
Party by Keir Starmer or has it been

1838
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.328
Party by Keir Starmer or has it been
undermined in the reaction to

1839
00:54:07.328 --> 00:54:07.578
Party by Keir Starmer or has it been
undermined in the reaction toJeremy

1840
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:08.453
undermined in the reaction to jeremy
Corbyn? It is a

1841
00:54:08.453 --> 00:54:10.662
undermined in the reaction toJeremy
Corbyn? It is a tragedy what has

Corbyn? It is a tragedy what has
taken place and I

said, actually. But you raise an
important issue, and I grieve,

00:54:22.328 --> 00:54:23.578
generally grieve for what has
happened in public discourse in the

1852
00:54:23.578 --> 00:54:25.412
happened in public discourse in the
course of the last few years. There

1853
00:54:25.412 --> 00:54:27.370
course of the last few years. There
is a rancour and bitterness that has

1854
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.412
is a rancour and bitterness that has
crept in and we are all individually

1855
00:54:30.412 --> 00:54:31.995
crept in and we are all individually
and collectively responsible for

1856
00:54:31.995 --> 00:54:32.578
and collactively responsible for
that.

1857
00:54:32.578 --> 00:54:33.870
and collectively responsible for
that. And to see the anti—Semitism,

1858
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.203
that. And to see the anti-Semitism,
and we

1859
00:54:35.203 --> 00:54:35.912
that. And to see the anti—Semitism,
and we have all met

1860
00:54:35.912 --> 00:54:36.078
that. And to see the anti—Semitism,
and we have all metJewish

1861
00:54:36.078 --> 00:54:37.162
and we have all metJewish
organisations, members of the

1862
00:54:37.162 --> 00:54:37.370
and we have all metJewish
organisations, members of theJewish

1863
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.578
organisations, members of the jewish
community

1864
00:54:37.578 --> 00:54:39.037
organisations, members of theJewish
community over the course of the

1865
00:54:39.037 --> 00:54:40.953
community over the course of the
last few years, and there is a real

1866
00:54:40.953 --> 00:54:41.703
last few years, and there is a real
fear, real

1867
00:54:41.703 --> 00:54:41.995
last few years, and there is a real
fear, realfear

1868
00:54:41.995 --> 00:54:44.662
last few years, and there is a real
fear, realfearthat

1869
00:54:44.662 --> 00:54:45.453
last few years, and there is a real
fear, real fear that they have, and

1870
00:54:45.453 --> 00:54:45.870
fear, realfear that they have, and
that is

1871
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:46.828
fear, real fear that they have, and
that is something we are all

1872
00:54:46.828 --> 00:54:48.412
that is something we are all
responsible for and we all have to

1873
00:54:48.412 --> 00:54:50.620
responsible for and we all have to
accept responsibility for and it is

1874
00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.287
accept responsibility for and it is
a crying shame what has happened to

1875
00:54:52.287 --> 00:54:56.787
a crying shame what has happened to
the Labour Party. I observed Jeremy

1876
00:54:56.787 --> 00:54:57.203
the labour Party. I observed jeremy
at close

1877
00:54:57.203 --> 00:54:58.412
the Labour Party. I observed Jeremy
at close quarters over the course of

1878
00:54:58.412 --> 00:55:00.370
at close quarters over the course of
the last few years and I don’t know

1879
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:02.120
the last few years and I don’t know
why he didn’t have the ability to

1880
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.870
why he didn’t have the ability to
deal with this as he should have

1881
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.120
deal with this as he should have
done but I will say as an individual

1882
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.370
done but I will say as an individual
and human being, he is not a bad

1883
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.287
and human being, he is nota bad
man. And I

1884
00:55:09.287 --> 00:55:10.745
and human being, he is not a bad
man. And I think it’s important to

1885
00:55:10.745 --> 00:55:13.203
man. And I think it’s important to
state that. But he has to accept his

1886
00:55:13.203 --> 00:55:15.120
state that. But he has to accept his
responsibilities of not having dealt

1887
00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.828
responsibilities of not having dealt
with this and to have the generosity

1888
00:55:16.828 --> 00:55:19.203
with this and to have the generosity
of spirit to recognise that he has

1889
00:55:19.203 --> 00:55:22.037
of spirit to recognise that he has
to make that full apology today. But

1890
00:55:22.037 --> 00:55:24.412
to make that full apology today. But
all of us, each and every one of us,

1891
00:55:24.412 --> 00:55:26.662
all of us, each and every one of us,
has got to make sure that those from

1892
00:55:26.662 --> 00:55:27.078
has got to make sure that those from
the jewish

1893
00:55:27.078 --> 00:55:27.287
has got to make sure that those from
theJewish community

1894
00:55:27.287 --> 00:55:27.620
has got to make sure that those from
the Jewish community and

1895
00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.162
has got to make sure that those from
theJewish community and the Muslim

1896
00:55:28.162 --> 00:55:28.370
the jewish community and the Muslim
community,

1897
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:31.037
theJewish community and the Muslim
community, and the wider sense of

1898
00:55:31.037 --> 00:55:31.412
community, and the wider sense of
community ran

1899
00:55:31.412 --> 00:55:33.203
community, and the wider sense of
community can live here in peace and

1900
00:55:33.203 --> 00:55:33.578
community ran live here in peace and
solidarity with

1901
00:55:33.578 --> 00:55:35.412
community can live here in peace and
solidarity with all of us and I will

1902
00:55:35.412 --> 00:55:37.537
solidarity with all of us and I will
tell you, there’s an awful lot of

1903
00:55:37.537 --> 00:55:39.912
tell you, there’s an awful lot of
work we have to do to make sure we

1904
00:55:39.912 --> 00:55:42.412
work we have to do to make sure we
drive out hate crime in all of its

1905
00:55:42.412 --> 00:55:42.537
drive out hate crime in all of its
“75

1906
00:55:42.537 --> 00:55:43.787
drive out hate crime in all of its
ways throughout all parts of these

1907
00:55:43.787 --> 00:55:45.162
ways throughout all parts of these
islands. We got about five minutes

1908
00:55:45.162 --> 00:55:48.745
islands. We got about five minutes
left and I’m going to squeeze in...

1909
00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:53.537
left and I’m going to squeeze in...
Really brieﬂy.

1910
00:55:53.537 --> 00:55:54.287
left and I’m going to squeeze in...
Really briefly. Just to answer,

1911
00:55:54.287 --> 00:55:54.412
Really brieﬂy. just to answer,
there

1912
00:55:54.412 --> 00:55:55.787
Really briefly. Just to answer,
there is some positivity in this

1913
00:55:55.787 --> 00:55:57.412
there is some positivity in this
which is there is an opportunity for

1914
00:55:57.412 --> 00:56:00.245
which is there is an opportunity for
the Labour Party to change its

1915
00:56:00.245 --> 00:56:00.912
the labour Party to change its
disciplinary

1916
00:56:00.912 --> 00:56:01.828
the Labour Party to change its
disciplinary process and not let

1917
00:56:01.828 --> 00:56:03.078
disciplinary process and not let
politicians be involved and for us

1918
00:56:03.078 --> 00:56:04.995
politicians be involved and for us
to set up something that could be an

1919
00:56:04.995 --> 00:56:07.328
to set up something that could be an
example of good practice, but

1920
00:56:07.328 --> 00:56:08.412
example of good practice, but
frankly, the other political parties

1921
00:56:08.412 --> 00:56:10.037
frankly, the other political parties
could learn from this and maybe all

1922
00:56:10.037 --> 00:56:13.037
could learn from this and maybe all
of us could develop and make sure

1923
00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:15.828
of us could develop and make sure
that when we say zero tolerance, we

1924
00:56:15.828 --> 00:56:17.745
that when we say zero tolerance, we
mean zero tolerance and we can sort

1925
00:56:17.745 --> 00:56:18.287
mean zero tolarance and we ran sort
it out

1926
00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:18.703
mean zero tolerance and we ran sort
it out property

1927
00:56:18.703 --> 00:56:19.245
mean zero tolerance and we can sort
it out properly amongst ourselves.

1928
00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:19.870
it out property amongst ourselves.
Let’s squeeze

1929
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:20.745
it out properly amongst ourselves.
Let’s squeeze in one last question

1930
00:56:20.745 --> 00:56:22.828
Let’s squeeze in one last question
as we have five minutes to go, from

1931
00:56:22.828 --> 00:56:25.078
as we have five minutes to go, from
Caroline.

1932
00:56:25.078 --> 00:56:27.703
Do you think it is morally
justifiable to produce a drama

1933
00:56:27.703 --> 00:56:30.162
which is partially based on truth
and real life events

1934
00:56:30.162 --> 00:56:32.453
when the subjects are unable
to defend themselves about any

1935
00:56:32.453 --> 00:56:35.120
misrepresentations?

1936
00:56:39.828 --> 00:56:42.245
What are you referring to? Are you

1937
00:56:42.245 --> 00:56:43.162
what are you referring to? Are you
referring to the

1938
00:56:43.162 --> 00:56:44.245
What are you referring to? Are you
referring to the The Crown about the

1939
00:56:44.245 --> 00:56:44.912
referring to the The Crown about the
Royal family? I

1940
00:56:44.912 --> 00:56:45.203
referring to the The Crown about the
Royalfamily? I am

1941
00:56:45.203 --> 00:56:47.162
referring to the The Crown about the
Royalfamily? lam indeed. You are.

1942
00:56:47.162 --> 00:56:49.370
Royal family? lam indeed. You are.
Yes, Fraser.

1943
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:50.370
Royalfamily? lam indeed. You are.
Yes, Fraser. Have you been watching

1944
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:51.703
Yes, Fraser. Have you been watching
it? Been going for several series

1945
00:56:51.703 --> 00:56:54.162
it? Been going for several series
now but what is your view on what

1946
00:56:54.162 --> 00:56:56.078
now but what is your view on what
Caroline asked? I am midway through

1947
00:56:56.078 --> 00:56:57.662
Caroline asked? I am midway through
the fourth series and you see what

1948
00:56:57.662 --> 00:56:59.620
the fourth series and you see what
has happened this time in that they

1949
00:56:59.620 --> 00:56:59.995
has happened this time in that they
are ﬂipping

1950
00:56:59.995 --> 00:57:00.995
has happened this time in that they
are flipping the characters as they

1951
00:57:00.995 --> 00:57:01.120
are ﬂipping the characters as they
started

1952
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.953
are flipping the characters as they
started off being sympathetic and

1953
00:57:01.953 --> 00:57:03.703
started off being sympathetic and
you like them all in the first three

1954
00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:06.453
you like them all in the first three
series and now they all seem mean,

1955
00:57:06.453 --> 00:57:07.870
series and now they all seem mean,
snobbish, hard—hearted, but

1956
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:08.203
series and now they all seem mean,
snobbish, hard—hearted, butl

1957
00:57:08.203 --> 00:57:09.953
series and now they all seem mean,
snobbish, hard—hearted, but I have

1958
00:57:09.953 --> 00:57:10.828
snobbish, hard-hearted, butl have
to say you are

1959
00:57:10.828 --> 00:57:11.453
snobbish, hard—hearted, but I have
to say you are just watching some

1960
00:57:11.453 --> 00:57:14.412
to say you are just watching some
telly because it is beautifully

1961
00:57:14.412 --> 00:57:14.578
telly because it is beautifuuy
shot,

1962
00:57:14.578 --> 00:57:15.412
telly because it is beautifully
shot, mesmerising, and you can’t

1963
00:57:15.412 --> 00:57:17.078
shot, mesmerising, and you can’t
wait for the next episode and I

1964
00:57:17.078 --> 00:57:18.828
wait for the next episode and I
don’t really see it as a

1965
00:57:18.828 --> 00:57:21.328
don’t really see it as a
documentary. I do feel a wee bit

1966
00:57:21.328 --> 00:57:25.745
documentary. I do feel a wee bit
sorry for the Queen being betrayed,

1967
00:57:25.745 --> 00:57:26.870
sorry for the Queen being betrayed,
right now, --

1968
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:28.162
sorry for the Queen being betrayed,
right now, —— portrayed right now as

1969
00:57:28.162 --> 00:57:28.620
right now, -- portrayed right now as
being more

1970
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.787
right now, —— portrayed right now as
being more hard—hearted than she is,

1971
00:57:29.787 --> 00:57:31.037
being more hard-hearted than she is,
but it is a story

1972
00:57:31.037 --> 00:57:32.328
being more hard—hearted than she is,
but it is a story that these guys

1973
00:57:32.328 --> 00:57:34.328
but it is a story that these guys
are telling. They are using some of

1974
00:57:34.328 --> 00:57:35.662
are telling. They are using some of
the most incredible raw material and

1975
00:57:35.662 --> 00:57:39.120
the most incredible raw material and
they are telling our country’s

1976
00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:39.495
they are telling our countrrs
story, in

1977
00:57:39.495 --> 00:57:41.162
they are telling our country’s
story, in many ways, and perhaps the

1978
00:57:41.162 --> 00:57:43.203
story, in many ways, and perhaps the
problem with The Crown is it is so

1979
00:57:43.203 --> 00:57:44.703
problem with The Crown is it is so
good and so engrossing that you

1980
00:57:44.703 --> 00:57:46.537
good and so engrossing that you
watch the first few series and it is

1981
00:57:46.537 --> 00:57:48.162
watch the first few series and it is
like you are watching history happen

1982
00:57:48.162 --> 00:57:49.953
like you are watching history happen
in front of you and that is how

1983
00:57:49.953 --> 00:57:51.870
in front of you and that is how
realistic they make it. So I can

1984
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:52.537
realistic they make it. So I ran
see, for that

1985
00:57:52.537 --> 00:57:53.578
realistic they make it. So I can
see, for that reason, when they

1986
00:57:53.578 --> 00:57:55.537
see, for that reason, when they
start to input mean things in the

1987
00:57:55.537 --> 00:57:58.203
start to input mean things in the
mouths of the royals, you almost

1988
00:57:58.203 --> 00:57:59.328
mouths of the royals, you almost
start to believe it actually

1989
00:57:59.328 --> 00:58:00.662
start to believe it actually
happened, but then again, you can

1990
00:58:00.662 --> 00:58:01.162
happened, but then again, you ran
switch it

1991
00:58:01.162 --> 00:58:02.953
happened, but then again, you can
switch it off and make a cup of tea

1992
00:58:02.953 --> 00:58:03.912
switch it off and make a cup of tea
and remember it’s

1993
00:58:03.912 --> 00:58:04.203
switch it off and make a cup of tea
and remember it’sjust

1994
00:58:04.203 --> 00:58:05.037
switch it off and make a cup of tea
and remember it’s just the telly.

1995
00:58:05.037 --> 00:58:06.703
and remember it’s just the telly.
That is the problem, that if you

1996
00:58:06.703 --> 00:58:07.078
That is the problam, that if you
want to

1997
00:58:07.078 --> 00:58:09.120
That is the problem, that if you
want to call it a problem, but it is

1998
00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:09.662
want to all it a problam, but it is
drama and

1999
00:58:09.662 --> 00:58:10.412
want to call it a problem, but it is
drama and there are fictitious

2000
00:58:10.412 --> 00:58:12.037
drama and there are fictitious
elements because it is a drama, and

2001
00:58:12.037 --> 00:58:12.453
elements because it is a drama, and
peopla may

2002
00:58:12.453 --> 00:58:16.328
elements because it is a drama, and
people may watch and think, I will

2008
00:58:21.953 --> 00:58:22.578
from the fact. with my hand on my
heart I ran

2009
00:58:22.578 --> 00:58:24.037
from the fact. With my hand on my
heart I can tell you I’ve never seen

2010
00:58:24.037 --> 00:58:24.953
heart I ran tell you I’ve never seen
an episode of it,

2011
00:58:24.953 --> 00:58:26.120
heart I can tell you I’ve never seen
an episode of it, I’ve got the real

2012
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.662
an episode of it, I’ve got the real
thing, and Her Majesty are simply

2013
00:58:27.662 --> 00:58:28.703
thing, and Her Majesty are simply
amazing. No intention of watching

2014
00:58:28.703 --> 00:58:34.412
amazing. No intention of watching
it. Ian? I have to agree that it is

2015
00:58:34.412 --> 00:58:36.370
it. Ian? I have to agree that it is
drama and if people enjoy watching

2016
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:37.203
drama and if peopla enjoy watching
it, so be it.

2017
00:58:37.203 --> 00:58:38.537
drama and if people enjoy watching
it, so be it. But it is about people

2018
00:58:38.537 --> 00:58:39.078
it, so be it. But it is about peopla
who are

2019
00:58:39.078 --> 00:58:40.662
it, so be it. But it is about people
who are around now and cannot really

2020
00:58:40.662 --> 00:58:40.870
who are around now and rannot really
answer

2021
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:42.662
who are around now and cannot really
answer back. At the end of the day

2022
00:58:42.662 --> 00:58:44.787
answer back. At the end of the day
it is drama and everybody should see

2023
00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:47.078
it is drama and everybody should see
it as that. Again, I have to say I

2024
00:58:47.078 --> 00:58:49.453
it as that. Again, I have to say I
find myself agreeing with Rose. We

2025
00:58:49.453 --> 00:58:51.953
find myself agreeing with Rose. We
know the Queen and who she is. I

2026
00:58:51.953 --> 00:58:53.745
know the Queen and who she is. I
haven’t seen it either. I am still

2027
00:58:53.745 --> 00:58:57.370
haven’t seen it either. I am still
catching up on the West Wing, and

2028
00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:57.995
catching up on the West wing, and
not got onto

2029
00:58:57.995 --> 00:58:59.037
catching up on the West Wing, and
not got onto the The Crown and

2030
00:58:59.037 --> 00:58:59.412
not got onto the The Crown and
peopla do

2031
00:58:59.412 --> 00:59:00.662
not got onto the The Crown and
people do have the ability to switch

2032
00:59:00.662 --> 00:59:01.412
peopla do have the ability to switch
it off on

2033
00:59:01.412 --> 00:59:02.037
people do have the ability to switch
it off on those making television

2034
00:59:02.037 --> 00:59:03.412
it off on those making television
programmes when people are still

2035
00:59:03.412 --> 00:59:03.745
programmes when peopla are still
with us

2036
00:59:03.745 --> 00:59:05.412
programmes when people are still
with us when they have to be

2037
00:59:05.412 --> 00:59:06.828
with us when they have to be
respectful, but it is television and

2038
00:59:06.828 --> 00:59:07.245
respectful, but it is telavision and
it is

2039
00:59:07.245 --> 00:59:09.537
respectful, but it is television and
it is drama and should be seen for

2040
00:59:09.537 --> 00:59:11.620
it is drama and should be seen for
what it is, exactly that. It is

2041
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.245
what it is, exactly that. It is
entertainment. Do you feel like

2042
00:59:13.245 --> 00:59:14.370
entertainment. Do you feel like
that, james?

2043
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.578
entertainment. Do you feel like
that, James? If it was you featuring

2044
00:59:15.578 --> 00:59:15.953
that, james? If it was you featuring
in a

2045
00:59:15.953 --> 00:59:20.245
that, James? If it was you featuring
in a drama? There was a drama made

2046
00:59:20.245 --> 00:59:21.995
in a drama? There was a drama made
about me, and if someone was foolish

2047
00:59:21.995 --> 00:59:23.662
about me, and if someone was foolish
enough to make one about me and

2048
00:59:23.662 --> 00:59:25.412
enough to make one about me and
expect anyone to watch it, that’s a

2049
00:59:25.412 --> 00:59:27.370
expect anyone to watch it, that’s a
different thing but I think Rose is

2050
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:29.120
different thing but I think Rose is
spot on and she’s in the wonderful

2051
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.412
spot on and she’s in the wonderful
position where she gets the real

2052
00:59:30.412 --> 00:59:34.495
position where she gets the real
thing, so why make do with the

2053
00:59:34.495 --> 00:59:37.287
thing, so why make do with the
synthetic when you have the full

2054
00:59:37.287 --> 00:59:39.828
synthetic when you have the full
Monty, as it were customer you are

2055
00:59:39.828 --> 00:59:41.495
Monty, as it were customer you are
in a drama, James, it’s the UK

2056
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:45.328
in a drama, James, it’s the UK
Government. Don’t give up the day

2057
00:59:45.328 --> 00:59:48.287
Government. Don’t give up the day
job, Ian. I have

2058
00:59:48.287 --> 00:59:48.578
Government. Don’t give up the day
job, Ian. I haveto

2059
00:59:48.578 --> 00:59:49.412
Government. Don’t give up the day
job, Ian. I have to admit that this

2060
00:59:49.412 --> 00:59:51.537
job, Ian. I have to admit that this
socialist has watched every single

2061
00:59:51.537 --> 00:59:54.078
socialist has watched every single
one of the The Crown. Is it morally

2062
00:59:54.078 --> 00:59:55.120
one of the The Crown. Is it morally
justifiabla to

2063
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.037
one of the The Crown. Is it morally
justifiable to produce the drama?

2064
00:59:56.037 --> 00:59:58.078
justifiable to produce the drama?
They can’t defence themselves. I

2065
00:59:58.078 --> 01:00:00.287
They can’t defence themselves. I
think the first three series were

2066
01:00:00.287 --> 01:00:01.703
think the first three series were
much more of a comfortable watch

2067
01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:04.537
much more of a comfortable watch
than the last one which was full of

2068
01:00:04.537 --> 01:00:06.412
than the last one which was full of
anguish and the most terrible things

2069
01:00:06.412 --> 01:00:07.953
anguish and the most terrible things
happen. We know, objectively

2070
01:00:07.953 --> 01:00:08.995
happen. We know, objectively
speaking, the most terrible things

2071
01:00:08.995 --> 01:00:12.162
speaking, the most terrible things
have happened recently in the middle

2072
01:00:12.162 --> 01:00:13.745
have happened recently in the middle
of Charles and Diana’s marriage and

2073
01:00:13.745 --> 01:00:16.245
of Charles and Diana’s marriage and
the anguish that the couple had, but

2074
01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:19.287
the anguish that the couple had, but
of course the problem is the poor

2075
01:00:19.287 --> 01:00:21.162
of course the problem is the poor
boys, William and Harry and this is

2076
01:00:21.162 --> 01:00:23.328
boys, William and Harry and this is
a drama about their parents, and

2077
01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:24.412
a drama about their parents, and
actually, we perhaps should be

2078
01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:31.578
actually, we perhaps should be
thinking about that. And maybe

2079
01:00:32.412 --> 01:00:33.495
thinking about that. And maybe not
the, not he,

2080
01:00:33.495 --> 01:00:34.662
thinking about that. And maybe not
the, not be, appreciate it as a

2081
01:00:34.662 --> 01:00:36.412
the, not be, appreciate it as a
drama, but these are real people who

2082
01:00:36.412 --> 01:00:37.953
drama, but these are real peopla who
are alive

2083
01:00:37.953 --> 01:00:39.287
drama, but these are real people who
are alive and have suffered as a

2084
01:00:39.287 --> 01:00:40.578
are alive and have suffered as a
result of the break—up of their

2085
01:00:40.578 --> 01:00:41.287
result of the break-up of their
parents

2086
01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:42.703
result of the break—up of their
parents marriage being done so

2087
01:00:42.703 --> 01:00:44.287
parents marriage being done so
publicly. But that’s not enough to

2088
01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:46.078
publicly. But that’s not enough to
stop you watching it? But I have

2089

stop you watching it? But I have
watched it. So there we are. Our

hour is up and it’s not something we

2091
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.370
hour is up and it’s not something we
often get to talk about, dramas

# He’s behind you now

# You cannot hear me... #

2128

New Icelandic drama...

2129
01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:34.828
As we near the halfway point,
the competition is hotting up.

2130
01:02:34.828 --> 01:02:37.703
And because Strictly can’t make it
to Blackpool this year,

2131
01:02:37.703 --> 01:02:42.037
our couples will be bringing
the Blackpool spirit to the studio.

2132
01:02:42.037 --> 01:02:44.203
Absolutely spectacular.

2133
01:03:06.412 --> 01:03:10.287
Chris, I know you are a big fan
of Oprah, so I know you will have

2134
01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:13.120
seen her tweet today about how
she did her interview with Obama

2135
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.037
with her in California
and him in Washington,

2136
01:03:15.037 --> 01:03:18.037
DC, but they used Hollywood green
screen technology to make it

2137
01:03:18.037 --> 01:03:21.370
look like they were in
the same living room.

2138
01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:24.412
In front of a fire —
looked a beautiful scene, didn’t it?

2139
01:03:24.412 --> 01:03:27.537
You know, we like to think we can
do a bit of television

2140
01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.495
wizardry on Newscast,
but nothing on that scale.

2141
01:03:30.495 --> 01:03:32.412
Well, where Oprah goes,
we like to follow,

2142
01:03:32.412 --> 01:03:34.370
because Chris Mason is also
in a Hollywood—style

2143
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:37.203
green screen room.

2144
01:03:37.203 --> 01:03:41.245
Then, by the power of TV magic,
we can put him in the Oval Office

2145
01:03:41.245 --> 01:03:44.203
with notjust Barack Obama
but Donald Trump, too.

2146
01:03:44.203 --> 01:03:45.453
Hello, bros.

2147
01:03:45.453 --> 01:03:48.078
Would you mind getting
a social distance?

2148
01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:49.495
Mind you, Oprah, look at this.

2149
01:03:49.495 --> 01:03:51.370
We’ve got them both.

2150
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:54.328
Yeah, that’s much more Newscast,
isn’t it, to have a casual chat

2151
01:03:54.328 --> 01:03:57.162
with a couple of people rather
thanjust a big sit—down interview

2152
01:03:57.162 --> 01:03:58.245
with one boring person.

2153
01:03:58.245 --> 01:03:59.245
Exactly.

2154
01:03:59.245 --> 01:04:02.162
And we can also go one better
thanJon Sopel from Americast,

2155
01:04:02.162 --> 01:04:04.995
who would not stop going
on about his cameo in The Crown.

2156
01:04:04.995 --> 01:04:07.787
We can put Chris Mason
in the real Crown.

2157
01:04:07.787 --> 01:04:09.245
Hello, Ma’am!

2158
01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:10.828
An exclusive interview.

2159
01:04:10.828 --> 01:04:12.412
I’ve even brought a microphone.

2160
01:04:12.412 --> 01:04:14.037
She’s a bit quiet, isn’t she?

2161
01:04:14.037 --> 01:04:16.620
So, Ma’am, let me tell
you what we’ve got on Newscast.

2162
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.787
We are going to talk Christmas,
seeing as you’ve got the tree up.

2163
01:04:19.787 --> 01:04:21.662
We’ll talk about your
Home Secretary, Priti Patel,

2164
01:04:21.662 --> 01:04:22.870
on this edition of Newscast.

2165
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.078
She doesn’t look very impressed.

2166
01:04:24.078 --> 01:04:26.162
Hopefully she will be by the end.

2167
01:04:26.412 --> 01:04:27.453
Newscast.

2168
01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:29.703
Newscast from the BBC.

2169
01:04:34.828 --> 01:04:35.870
Hello.

2170
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:37.078
It’s Adam in the studio.

2171
01:04:37.078 --> 01:04:39.245
And Laura in the same
studio, two metres apart.

2172
01:04:39.245 --> 01:04:40.287
Just checking.

2173
01:04:40.287 --> 01:04:41.912
And Fergus in New
Broadcasting House.

2174
01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:46.453
And Chris in the socially
distanced booth of news.

2175
01:04:46.453 --> 01:04:48.245
Hello, everyone.

2176
01:04:48.245 --> 01:04:50.870
I think it’s become clear
in the last few days that,

2177
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.995
because I am not going to be able
to have a massive, big,

2178
01:04:53.995 --> 01:04:56.870
normal Christmas, what I’m
going to do is smuggle a little bit

2179
01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.828
of Christmas in, starting now,
to sort of spread it out.

2180
01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:04.120
Because, Laura and Fergus,
it is still not clear what Christmas

2181
01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.578
is going to look like.

2182
01:05:05.578 --> 01:05:08.203
We are getting more and more
clues every day about how

2183
01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:10.120
the scientists see it,
and maybe the decisions

2184
01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.370
the politicians will
have to start making.

2185
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.412
That’s right.

2186
01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:15.578
Shall we do big picture?

2187
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.620
Yeah.

2188
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.787
So, the government —
notjust here but Edinburgh,
