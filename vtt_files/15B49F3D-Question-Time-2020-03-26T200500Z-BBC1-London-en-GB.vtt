157
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.195
accounts for a year or more and has
been left high and dry. The scheme

158
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:29.570
been left high and dry. The scheme
will apply to a 95% of those

159
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.820
will apply to a 95% of those
self—employed and those earning over

160
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.986
self-employed and those earning over
£50,000

161
00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.570
self—employed and those earning over
£50,000 will not be eligible to stop

162
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.528
£50,000 will not be eligibla to stop
we are asking

163
00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:35.570
£50,000 will not be eligible to stop
we are asking people to provide

164
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.528
we are asking people to provide
three years’ worth of earnings. We

165
00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:39.986
three years’ worth of earnings. We
have said, however, we will look at

166
00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:44.361
have said, however, we will look at
what ever you have got. It is easier

167
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:45.945
what ever you have got. It is easier
to operate the scheme if you come to

168
00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:48.945
to operate the scheme if you come to
us with three years’ earnings. That

169
00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:52.361
us with three years’ earnings. That
is the commitment we made today. But

170
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:54.778
is the commitment we made today. But
if you do not have that, we will do

171
00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:56.861
if you do not have that, we will do
whatever we can to support you. I

172
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:57.736
whatever we ran to support you. I
would urge

173
00:05:57.736 --> 00:05:58.778
whatever we can to support you. I
would urge people in that situation

174
00:05:58.778 --> 00:05:59.445
would urge peopla in that situation
to give us

175
00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:01.070
would urge people in that situation
to give us what they have got and we

176
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.945
to give us what they have got and we
will work through it with HMRC to

177
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.778
will work through it with HMRC to
see if there is a way to support

178
00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:07.945
see if there is a way to support
you. This is a difficult scheme to

179
00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:09.778
you. This is a difficult scheme to
implement. People who are

180
00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:11.028
implement. People who are
self—employed will appreciate that.

181
00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:11.570
self-employed will appreciate that.
It is

182
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.195
self—employed will appreciate that.
It is much harder

183
00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:13.653
self—employed will appreciate that.
It is much harderfrom an

184
00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:13.778
It is much harder from an
operational

185
00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:14.986
It is much harderfrom an
operational perspective, than to

186
00:06:14.986 --> 00:06:16.403
operational perspective, than to
create a scheme for employees where

187
00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:16.945
create a scheme for employees where
you ran easily

188
00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:18.861
create a scheme for employees where
you can easily see what they are

189
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:19.361
you ran easily see what they are
earning, and

190
00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:20.445
you can easily see what they are
earning, and we can see the link

191
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:21.570
earning, and we ran see the link
between

192
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.695
earning, and we can see the link
between them and their employer.

193
00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:24.820
between them and their employer.
Here we have to design a scheme that

194
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.028
Here we have to design a scheme that
is deliverable. It would be wrong to

195
00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:29.486
is deliverable. It would be wrong to
raise false hope and pretend this is

196
00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:31.028
raise false hope and pretend this is
simple. The Chancellor has designed

197
00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:32.945
simple. The Chancellor has designed
a scheme that can help get that

198
00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:33.403
a scheme that ran help get that
money to

199
00:06:33.403 --> 00:06:35.278
a scheme that can help get that
money to those people. If you do not

200
00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:35.528
money to those peopla. If you do not
have

201
00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.528
money to those people. If you do not
have those records, still give us

202
00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:40.528
have those records, still give us
what you have got. Even if you do

203
00:06:40.528 --> 00:06:43.028
what you have got. Even if you do
not have a year’s accounts, you can

204
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:43.736
not have a year’s accounts, you ran
still go to the

205
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:44.611
not have a year’s accounts, you can
still go to the government to see if

206
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:49.153
still go to the government to see if
you are eligible? Yes, we cannot

207
00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:51.153
you are eligible? Yes, we cannot
promise, but we will see what we can

208
00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:51.861
promise, but we will see what we ran
give them with

209
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.986
promise, but we will see what we can
give them with what they have got to

210
00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:58.403
give them with what they have got to
see if it can apply to them. Emily?

211
00:06:58.403 --> 00:06:59.320
see if it ran apply to them. Emily?
I am not

212
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.403
see if it can apply to them. Emily?
I am not pretending this is not

213
00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:03.070
I am not pretending this is not
difficult. It is important to

214
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.153
difficult. It is important to
acknowledge the assistance the

215
00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:05.278
acknowledge the assistance the
government has given and they have

216
00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:06.945
government has given and they have
done a great deal and it has been

217
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:09.570
done a great deal and it has been
very radical. However, self—employed

218
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.903
very radical. However, self-employed
people are in a

219
00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:13.570
very radical. However, self—employed
people are in a great variety of

220
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.778
peopla are in a great variety of
jobs and it is a

221
00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:15.778
people are in a great variety of
jobs and it is a difficult scheme to

222
00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:17.778
jobs and it is a difficult scheme to
get up and running. What the

223
00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:17.945
get up and mnning. what the
government

224
00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:19.570
get up and running. What the
government has been tempted to do,

225
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.028
government has been tempted to do,
and I understand why, is to do a

226
00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:23.820
and I understand why, is to do a
nice, neat headline, worked for

227
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.028
nice, neat headline, worked for
three years, you will get 80% up to

228
00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:28.153
three years, you will get 8096 up to
2500.

229
00:07:28.153 --> 00:07:29.778
three years, you will get 80% up to
2500. But self—employed people fit

230
00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:30.361
2500. But self-employed peopla fit
into many

231
00:07:30.361 --> 00:07:31.028
2500. But self—employed people fit
into many different categories.

232
00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:33.195
into many different categories.
There are a number of problems that

233
00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:35.778
There are a number of problems that
are immediately obvious. The first

234
00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:38.236
are immediately obvious. The first
is they will not get any money until

235
00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:39.570
is they will not get any money until
june, so there

236
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.653
is they will not get any money until
June, so there will be a lot of

237
00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:41.945
June, so there will be a lot of
self—employed people who will not

238
00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:42.236
self-employed peopla who will not
have

239
00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:46.028
self—employed people who will not
have had money since February. We

240
00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:47.945
have had money since February. We
have a tweet from Katie Rose

241
00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:48.320
have a tweet from Katie Rose
Bennett, 3

242
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.986
have a tweet from Katie Rose
Bennett, a singer songwriter. Is

243
00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:51.361
Bennett, a singer songwriter. Is
March the 26 and the beginning of

244
00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:52.278
March the 26 and the beginning of
june is a long

245
00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:54.986
March the 26 and the beginning of
June is a long time away for all the

246
00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:56.570
June is a long time away for all the
self—employed people I know. What do

247
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.278
self-employed peopla I know. what do
you expect us

248
00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.195
self—employed people I know. What do
you expect us to eat? Exactly, that

249
00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:03.445
you expect us to eat? Exactly, that
is part of the problem. Mark in

250
00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:04.320
is part of the problem. Mark in
particular, a self—employed plumber,

251
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.528
particular, a self-employed plumber,
he works

252
00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:07.111
particular, a self—employed plumber,
he works in construction, and there

253
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:07.778
he works in constmction, and there
is a question

254
00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:08.653
he works in construction, and there
is a question about whether or not

255
00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:11.236
is a question about whether or not
he is supposed to be working. Is he

256
00:08:11.236 --> 00:08:14.695
he is supposed to be working. Is he
an essential worker or we have seen

257
00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:15.861
an essential worker or we have seen
people up and down the country,

258
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:18.903
people up and down the country,
there is one in my constituency

259
00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:20.736
there is one in my constituency
where people are building luxury

260
00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:22.695
where peopla are building luxury
ﬂats.

261
00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:22.986
where people are building luxury
flats. We

262
00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:23.361
where peopla are building luxury
ﬂats. We get

263
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.028
where people are building luxury
flats. We get a number of different

264
00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:25.945
ﬂats. We get a number of different
problems

265
00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:27.570
flats. We get a number of different
problems colliding in this. Whilst

266
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:27.736
problams colliding in this. whilst
the

267
00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:28.570
problems colliding in this. Whilst
the government comes out with

268
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.778
the government comes out with
headlines, saying we will not leave

269
00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:32.778
headlines, saying we will not leave
anyone behind, the nitty—gritty is

270
00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:33.570
anyone behind, the nitty-gritty is
quite often

271
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.361
anyone behind, the nitty—gritty is
quite often that life is more

272
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.570
quite often that life is more
complicated and they need to keep

273
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.778
complicated and they need to keep
coming back with adjustments and I

274
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:40.945
coming back with adjustments and I
just hope that they listen to the

275
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.278
just hope that they listen to the
opposition when we do raise some of

276
00:08:42.278 --> 00:08:43.820
opposition when we do raise some of
these problems and they do work with

277
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.778
these problems and they do work with
us in order to be able to sort it

278
00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:48.195
us in order to be able to sort it
out. There are a variety of things

279
00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:52.028
out. There are a variety of things
that have not been sorted out. Mark

280
00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:54.778
that have not been sorted out. Mark
will now need to perhaps apply for

281
00:08:54.778 --> 00:08:56.153
will now need to perhaps apply for
Universal Credit. But if he applies

282
00:08:56.153 --> 00:08:58.361
Universal Credit. But if he applies
for it, he does not get any money

283
00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:00.528
for it, he does not get any money
for the first five weeks, that is

284
00:09:00.528 --> 00:09:03.486
for the first five weeks, that is
part of the system. Those who are

285
00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:05.070
part of the system. Those who are
applying, I had a constituent tweak

286
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.986
applying, I had a constituent tweak
me a photograph of where he was on

287
00:09:06.986 --> 00:09:10.111
me a photograph of where he was on
the waiting list when he was ringing

288
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:10.778
the waiting list when he was ringing
“P

289
00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:12.820
the waiting list when he was ringing
up and he had 99,000 people in front

290
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.736
up and he had 99,000 peopla in front
of him, and he

291
00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:14.736
up and he had 99,000 people in front
of him, and he was going to have to

292
00:09:14.736 --> 00:09:17.695
of him, and he was going to have to
wait for hours to speak to anybody

293
00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.945
wait for hours to speak to anybody
to even apply to go on to Universal

294
00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:23.778
to even apply to go on to Universal
Credit. This is the reality of

295
00:09:23.778 --> 00:09:25.695
Credit. This is the reality of
people’s lives. I am not pretending

296
00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:26.945
people’s lives. lam not pretending
it is not hard,

297
00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:27.945
people’s lives. I am not pretending
it is not hard, but I am saying that

298
00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:29.403
it is not hard, but I am saying that
more needs to be done and the

299
00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:32.653
more needs to be done and the
government needs to go further. When

300
00:09:32.653 --> 00:09:33.195
government needs to go further. when
you think about

301
00:09:33.195 --> 00:09:35.195
government needs to go further. When
you think about the people who work

302
00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:36.028
you think about the peopla who work
in your gym, a

303
00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:36.820
you think about the people who work
in your gym, 3 lot of the trainers

304
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.070
in your gym, a lot of the trainers
are

305
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.195
in your gym, 3 lot of the trainers
are self—employed, what has happened

306
00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:38.820
are self-employed, what has happened
with you in

307
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.403
are self—employed, what has happened
with you in terms of your staff?

308
00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:43.195
with you in terms of your staff?
This topic is very important to us

309
00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:45.611
This topic is very important to us
and I was pleased to see the steps

310
00:09:45.611 --> 00:09:47.111
and I was pleased to see the steps
the Chancellor made this evening in

311
00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:49.403
the Chancellor made this evening in
terms of putting together a package

312
00:09:49.403 --> 00:09:50.195
terms of putting together a package
for self—employed people. But

313
00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:50.403
terms of putting together a package
for self—employed people. Butl

314
00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:50.570
for self-employed peopla. Butl
would

315
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.861
for self—employed people. Butl
would echo some of the views Emily

316
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:56.111
would echo some of the views Emily
Reyes, that it is a complex

317
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:58.070
Reyes, that it is a complex
situation. The average tenure of our

318
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.028
situation. The average tenure of our
trainers is typically about eight or

319
00:10:00.028 --> 00:10:01.945
trainers is typically about eight or
nine months. Many of them will not

320
00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:05.111
nine months. Many of them will not
have had the trading history. Many

321
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:07.028
have had the trading history. Many
of them are recently qualified and

322
00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:08.778
of them are recently qualified and
new to the game of being

323
00:10:08.778 --> 00:10:10.570
new to the game of being
self—employed, so they might not be

324
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:10.695
self-employed, so they might not be
familiar

325
00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:12.986
self—employed, so they might not be
familiar with many of the features

326
00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:14.153
familiar with many of the features
required. Certainly they will have

327
00:10:14.153 --> 00:10:16.986
required. Certainly they will have
been watching this very carefully,

328
00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:19.361
been watching this very carefully,
we are talking about nearly 3000

329
00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:20.070
we are talking about hearty 3000
peopla in

330
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.028
we are talking about nearly 3000
people in our business, so a

331
00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:23.403
people in our business, so a
substantial number. They are

332
00:10:23.403 --> 00:10:23.611
substantial number. They are
typirallv

333
00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:24.195
substantial number. They are
typically young, very concerned

334
00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:27.778
typically young, very concerned
about their future. Our business

335
00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:27.986
typically young, very concerned
about theirfuture. Our business had

336
00:10:27.986 --> 00:10:29.111
about their future. Our business had
to dose

337
00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.028
about theirfuture. Our business had
to close down on Friday night after

338
00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:32.945
to close down on Friday night after
the Prime Minister asked us to. The

339
00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:35.195
the Prime Minister asked us to. The
whole business closed down within

340
00:10:35.195 --> 00:10:35.403
whola business closed down within
ten

341
00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:36.820
whole business closed down within
ten hours. A business that took us

342
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.278
ten hours. A business that took us
ten years to build closed down ten

343
00:10:40.278 --> 00:10:42.153
ten years to build closed down ten
hours. I have tremendous respect for

344
00:10:42.153 --> 00:10:44.945
hours. I have tremendous respect for
my colleagues all across our

345
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.736
my colleagues all across our
business. Other businesses are

346
00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:47.028
business. other businesses are
experiencing

347
00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:48.528
business. Other businesses are
experiencing same and we closed down

348
00:10:48.528 --> 00:10:51.778
experiencing same and we closed down
with goodwill because we knew it

349
00:10:51.778 --> 00:10:53.736
with goodwill because we knew it
would have to happen. We have had

350
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:54.195
would have to happen. We have had
peopla dose

351
00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.361
would have to happen. We have had
people close down their place of

352
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:55.611
peopla close down their place of
work

353
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:55.778
people close down their place of
work and

354
00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:55.986
peopla close down their place of
work and put

355
00:10:55.986 --> 00:10:56.403
people close down their place of
work and put themselves into

356
00:10:56.403 --> 00:10:56.611
work and put themselves into
1009an

357
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:59.403
work and put themselves into
jeopardy for the future and it is a

358
00:10:59.403 --> 00:11:01.195
jeopardy for the future and it is a
very challenging thing for them to

359
00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:01.361
very challanging thing for them to
have

360
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.486
very challenging thing for them to
have done. We will be supporting

361
00:11:03.486 --> 00:11:05.153
have done. We will be supporting
them and helping them with the

362
00:11:05.153 --> 00:11:06.570
them and helping them with the
interpretation of the package that

363
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.736
interpretation of the package that
the Chancellor has put together. I

364
00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.611
the Chancellor has put together. I
am glad to hear

365
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:12.653
the Chancellor has put together. I
am glad to hearfrom Robert that

366
00:11:12.653 --> 00:11:12.778
am glad to hear from Robert that
there

367
00:11:12.778 --> 00:11:14.611
am glad to hearfrom Robert that
there will be attention paid to

368
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:16.153
there will be attention paid to
people who might not have had the

369
00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:17.945
people who might not have had the
perfect trading history, to help

370
00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:20.028
perfect trading history, to help
them understand what might be done

371
00:11:20.028 --> 00:11:21.653
them understand what might be done
for them. We will be playing our

372
00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:25.570
for them. We will be playing our
part as much as we can, we are

373
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:25.736
part as much as we ran, we are
absolutely

them in every way that we can as

376
00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:29.570

377
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.403
them in every way that we can as
part of our overall ecosystem as a

378
00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:34.028
part of our overall ecosystem as a
business. Richard, it is so

379
00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:36.195
business. Richard, it is so
important that people feel they can

380
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:36.361
important that peopla feel they ran
afford

381
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:38.695
important that people feel they can
afford to be off work if at all

382
00:11:38.695 --> 00:11:39.945
afford to be offer ifatall
possibla in

383
00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:40.236
afford to be off work if at all
possible in order

384
00:11:40.236 --> 00:11:40.778
afford to be off work if at all
possible in orderfor the maximum

385
00:11:40.778 --> 00:11:40.986
possible in order for the maximum
number

386
00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:44.236
possible in orderfor the maximum
number of us to stay at home? One of

387
00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.486
number of us to stay at home? One of
the lessons of this epidemic is the

388
00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:48.736
the lessons of this epidemic is the
connectedness we all feel to one

389
00:11:48.736 --> 00:11:51.195
connectedness we all feel to one
another. My health depends upon your

390
00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:52.528
another. My health depends upon your
health, your health depends upon my

391
00:11:52.528 --> 00:11:56.778
health, your health depends upon my
health. We share that comment worth

392
00:11:56.778 --> 00:11:58.195
health. We share that comment worth
in our society. Maybe when we have

393
00:11:58.195 --> 00:11:59.403
in our society. Maybe when we have
got through this whole period that

394
00:11:59.403 --> 00:11:59.820
got through this whola period that
is one

395
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.320
got through this whole period that
is one of the lessons that will come

396
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.820
is one of the lassons that will come
out of this,

397
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.736
is one of the lessons that will come
out of this, that we understand the

398
00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:06.528
out of this, that we understand the
collective dose of society, and we

399
00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:07.320
collactive dose of society, and we
will all

400
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.028
collective dose of society, and we
will all have to invest more in our

401
00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:11.820
will all have to invest more in our
society, in social protection for

402
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.695
society, in social protection for
our society, in the NHS,

403
00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:14.945
society, in social protection for
oursociety, in the NHS, in

404
00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:15.153
society, in social protection for
our society, in the NHS, in an

405
00:12:15.153 --> 00:12:18.445
our society, in the NHS, in an
education system, to give us that

406
00:12:18.445 --> 00:12:20.028
education system, to give us that
security. Not the national security

407
00:12:20.028 --> 00:12:21.528
security. Not the national security
in the conventional way we think

408
00:12:21.528 --> 00:12:23.778
in the conventional way we think
about it, but the human Security

409
00:12:23.778 --> 00:12:25.236
about it, but the human Security
that we need to protect ourselves

410
00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:27.486
that we need to protect ourselves
from some of the shocks all around

411
00:12:27.486 --> 00:12:29.195
from some of the shocks all around
us. Maybe that is one of the

412
00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:32.070
us. Maybe that is one of the
benefits that we will see from this,

413
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.486
benefits that we will see from this,
that interdependence every single

414
00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.611
that interdependence every single
human being has in this country and

415
00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:36.820
human being has in this country and
across the planet.

00:13:16.736 --> 00:13:18.653
looks like 12 weeks. Had stayed on,
the company would have been able to

439
00:13:18.653 --> 00:13:21.695
the company would have been able to

talking here. As everyone is saying,

467
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.736
talking here. As everyone is saying,
Robert, no one is claiming this is

468
00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:14.236
Robert, no one is claiming this is
simpla, far

469
00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:15.361
Robert, no one is claiming this is
simple, farfrom it, but as Rishi

470
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:16.486
simpla, far from it, but as Rishi
Sunak said,

471
00:14:16.486 --> 00:14:17.778
simple, farfrom it, but as Rishi
Sunak said, people will have to wait

472
00:14:17.778 --> 00:14:18.153
Sunak said, peopla will have to wait
until at

473
00:14:18.153 --> 00:14:18.320
Sunak said, people will have to wait
until at least

474
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.986
Sunak said, people will have to wait
until at leastJune, they will not

475
00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:20.320
until at leastjune, they will not
have any

476
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.736
until at leastJune, they will not
have any money coming in before

477
00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.528
have any money coming in before
then. If they apply for Universal

478
00:14:24.528 --> 00:14:29.445
then. If they apply for Universal
Credit, we are talking about £73 a

479
00:14:29.445 --> 00:14:30.986
Credit, we are talking about £73 a
week after five weeks. Matt Hancock

480
00:14:30.986 --> 00:14:33.445
week after five weeks. Matt Hancock
said he could not live on that. Is

481
00:14:33.445 --> 00:14:35.570
said he could not live on that. Is
there not a simpler way? I am

482
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.570
there not a simpler way? I am
thinking perhaps in Ireland,

483
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.945
thinking perhaps in Ireland,
everyone who has lost their

484
00:14:40.945 --> 00:14:41.445
thinking perhaps in Ireland,
everyone who has lost theirjob, be

485
00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:44.028
everyone who has lost theirjob, be
they employed or self—employed, has

486
00:14:44.028 --> 00:14:44.903
they employed or self-employed, has
been given

487
00:14:44.903 --> 00:14:46.611
they employed or self—employed, has
been given 350 euros a week, just

488
00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:47.820
been given 350 euros a week, just
straightforward and simple. Would

489
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.153
straightforward and simple. Would
that not cut through this?

490
00:14:53.153 --> 00:14:54.445
For the self—employed we are taking

491
00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:56.945
For the self-employed we are taking
steps beyond

492
00:14:56.945 --> 00:14:58.070
For the self—employed we are taking
steps beyond what the Chancellor

493
00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.361
steps beyond what the Chancellor
announced today. I would like the

494
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:01.445
announced today. I would like the
scheme to be able to support people

495
00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:03.445
scheme to be able to support people
sooner but we need to make this a

496
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.320
sooner but we need to make this a
deliverable scheme that is actually

497
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.778
deliverable scheme that is actually
going to work and the experts at

498
00:15:07.778 --> 00:15:09.361
going to work and the experts at
HMRC think that is unfortunately the

499
00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:11.945
HMRC think that is unfortunately the
amount of time it takes to get the

500
00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.153
amount of time it takes to get the
scheme operational. We don’t want to

501
00:15:14.153 --> 00:15:16.445
scheme operational. We don’t want to
raise false hopes, we need to give

502
00:15:16.445 --> 00:15:17.695
raise false hopes, we need to give
people certainty about when they can

503
00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:18.070
people certainty about when they ran
expect money

504
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.236
people certainty about when they can
expect money in their bank accounts.

505
00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:22.153
expect money in their bank accounts.
You say the Chancellor will do other

506
00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:24.236
You say the Chancellor will do other
things so what are they? The other

507
00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:25.986
things so what are they? The other
steps we have ta ken

508
00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:26.820
things so what are they? The other
steps we have taken for example,

509
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.486
steps we have taken for example,
enabling people to access employment

510
00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:31.778
enabling people to access employment
support from day one. Removing the

511
00:15:31.778 --> 00:15:33.278
support from day one. Removing the
minimum income floor

512
00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:33.653
support from day one. Removing the
minimum income ﬂoorfrom Universal

513
00:15:33.653 --> 00:15:34.528
minimum income ﬂoor from Universal
Credit. We

514
00:15:34.528 --> 00:15:35.403
minimum income ﬂoorfrom Universal
Credit. We have put more money

515
00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:36.778
Credit. We have put more money
generally into the benefit system

516
00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:40.320
generally into the benefit system
for the benefit of everyone, around

517
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.986
for the benefit of everyone, around
£7 billion extra. We have made some

518
00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:43.820
£7 billion extra. We have made some
particular benefits that will be

519
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.070
particular benefits that will be
important to people, like Beverley

520
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.236
important to peopla, like Beverlay
you

521
00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.903
important to peopla, like Bevertay
you just heard

522
00:15:46.903 --> 00:15:47.695
important to people, like Beverley
you just heard from, more generous,

523
00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:49.653
you just heard from, more generous,
like housing benefit and the local

524
00:15:49.653 --> 00:15:49.903
like housing benefit and the [oral
housing

525
00:15:49.903 --> 00:15:51.486
like housing benefit and the local
housing allowance that will help you

526
00:15:51.486 --> 00:15:53.986
housing allowance that will help you
remain in your home and can in some

527
00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:54.820
remain in your home and ran in some
parts of the

528
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.945
remain in your home and can in some
parts of the country he a

529
00:15:56.945 --> 00:15:58.611
parts of the country he a
significant sum of money. For

530
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:00.361
significant sum of money. For
mortgage holders and renters we have

531
00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:03.195
mortgage holders and renters we have
also managed to agree firstly with

532
00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:06.278
also managed to agree firstly with
the mortgage companies, the lenders,

533
00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:07.611
the mortgage companies, the lenders,
a mortgage holiday of at least three

534
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.070
a mortgage holiday of at least three
months so you don’t need to be

535
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.486
months so you don’t need to be
worried about that, at least for the

536
00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:13.653
worried about that, at least for the
first few months, and we will

537
00:16:13.653 --> 00:16:15.820
first few months, and we will
obviously extend that by agreement

538
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.820
obviously extend that by agreement
if the coronavirus crisis continues

539
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.570
if the coronavirus crisis continues
in three months’ time. And for

540
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.153
in three months’ time. And for
renters, we have also agreed with

541
00:16:23.153 --> 00:16:25.861
renters, we have also agreed with
the Court service a complete

542
00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:27.570
the Court service a complete
moratorium on evictions so nobody,

543
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.320
moratorium on evictions so nobody,
quite rightly... For three months.

544
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.195
quite rightly... For three months.
Again, I have taken powers in the

545
00:16:33.195 --> 00:16:34.695
Again, I have taken powers in the
emergency legislation that has gone

546
00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.736
emergency legislation that has gone
through Parliament that gives me the

547
00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:37.070
through Partiament that gives me the
ability as

548
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:37.861
through Parliament that gives me the
ability as Secretary of State to

549
00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:39.778
ability as Secretary of State to
increase that to six months if

550
00:16:39.778 --> 00:16:41.486
increase that to six months if
needed. That gives people some

551
00:16:41.486 --> 00:16:43.195
needed. That gives people some
certainty at least that there is

552
00:16:43.195 --> 00:16:44.195
certainty at least that there is
absolutely no reason they should

553
00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:47.445
absolutely no reason they should
lose their home as a result. I know

554
00:16:47.445 --> 00:16:48.861
lose their home as a result. I know
this is very imperfect, and none of

555
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:50.153
this is very imperfect, and none of
us would want to make statements

556
00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:52.445
us would want to make statements
like that, but we are trying to use

557
00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:54.320
like that, but we are trying to use
all the levers available to us as

558
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.861
all the levers available to us as
government to give people the

559
00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:57.445
government to give people the
greatest degree of security possible

560
00:16:57.445 --> 00:17:00.820
greatest degree of security possible
in the circumstances. Can I pick up

561
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.945
in the circumstances. (“an I pick up
on a couple of

562
00:17:01.945 --> 00:17:03.736
in the circumstances. Can I pick up
on a couple of points from that? The

563
00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:05.820
on a couple of points from that? The
first thing is, those people renting

564
00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.445
first thing is, those people renting
accommodation, and let say they are

565
00:17:07.445 --> 00:17:10.111
accommodation, and let say they are
sharing a ﬂat and one of them

566
00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:10.278
accommodation, and let say they are
sharing a flat and one of them might

567
00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:11.903
sharing a ﬂat and one of them might
be self—employed or might be in

568
00:17:11.903 --> 00:17:12.070
be self-employed or might be in
insecure

569
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.778
be self—employed or might be in
insecure work. And a gang of kids

570
00:17:15.778 --> 00:17:18.236
insecure work. And a gang of kids
now renting a place can’t meet the

571
00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:19.903
now renting a place can’t meet the
rent. All right, they can’t get

572
00:17:19.903 --> 00:17:21.486
rent. All right, they can’t get
evicted for three months but the

573
00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:23.445
evicted for three months but the
truth is it usually takes two months

574
00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:25.361
truth is it usually takes two months
to evict people anyway, so actually

575
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:26.403
to evict peopla anyway, so actually
they only

576
00:17:26.403 --> 00:17:27.653
to evict people anyway, so actually
they only get one month and I don’t

577
00:17:27.653 --> 00:17:29.361
they only get one month and I don’t
think that is sufficient and I don’t

578
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.278
think that is sufficient and I don’t
think it gives people security at a

579
00:17:31.278 --> 00:17:31.528
think it gives peopla security at a
time

580
00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:33.528
think it gives people security at a
time like this. I do think if you

581
00:17:33.528 --> 00:17:35.695
time like this. I do think if you
have powers to do it then do it and

582
00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:37.903
have powers to do it then do it and
make sure no one is evicted for six

583
00:17:37.903 --> 00:17:39.528
make sure no one is evicted for six
months. Let’s do that now and I

584
00:17:39.528 --> 00:17:42.736
months. Let’s do that now and I
think it be sorted out. There’s a

585
00:17:42.736 --> 00:17:44.945
think it be sorted out. There’s a
couple of other points you raised.

586
00:17:44.945 --> 00:17:45.320
couple of other points you raised.
Brieﬂy

587
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.653
couple of other points you raised.
Briefly please because we have a lot

588
00:17:46.653 --> 00:17:48.445
Brieﬂy please because we have a lot
of questions.

589
00:17:48.445 --> 00:17:49.861
Briefly please because we have a lot
of questions. There are many other

590
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:50.153
of questions. There are many other
EWUPS-

591
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.611
of questions. There are many other
groups, like many on zero—hours

592
00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:53.195
groups, like many on zero-hours
contracts, or

593
00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:53.903
groups, like many on zero—hours
contracts, or carers providing

594
00:17:53.903 --> 00:17:56.778
contracts, or carers providing
social care. This is also in your

595
00:17:56.778 --> 00:17:57.611
social rare. This is also in your
brief. People

596
00:17:57.611 --> 00:17:58.861
social care. This is also in your
brief. People on zero—hour contracts

597
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.153
brief. People on zero-hour contracts
don’t get

598
00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:00.028
brief. People on zero—hour contracts
don’t get sickness benefit if they

599
00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:01.611
don’t get sickness benefit if they
are off sick but they are the ones

600
00:18:01.611 --> 00:18:04.528
are off sick but they are the ones
looking after the most sick, the

601
00:18:04.528 --> 00:18:05.403
looking after the most sick, the
most vulnerable, the elderly and

602
00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:05.778
most vulnerabla, the elderty and
going house

603
00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:07.111
most vulnerable, the elderly and
going house to house to look after

604
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:08.778
going house to house to look after
them. If they get sick themselves

605
00:18:08.778 --> 00:18:11.611
them. If they get sick themselves
they don’t get any benefit, that

606
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:13.945
they don’t get any benefit, that
must be wrong. Nothing is done for

607
00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:15.236
must be wrong. Nothing is done for
those on zero—hours contracts and

608
00:18:15.236 --> 00:18:15.445
those on zero-hours contracts and
the

609
00:18:15.445 --> 00:18:17.236
those on zero—hours contracts and
the government really must look at

610
00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:19.445
the government really must look at
that as well. Are you going to be

611
00:18:19.445 --> 00:18:21.695
that as well. Are you going to be
looking at that? We have taken

612
00:18:21.695 --> 00:18:23.986
looking at that? We have taken
steps, including the things I have

613
00:18:23.986 --> 00:18:27.153
steps, including the things I have
described to help self—employed

614
00:18:27.153 --> 00:18:29.945
described to help self-employed
peopla.

615
00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:33.445
described to help self—employed
people. And zero—hours contracts?

616
00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.236
peopla. And zero-hours contracts?
These things

617
00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:34.903
people. And zero—hours contracts?
These things apply to those

618
00:18:34.903 --> 00:18:38.861
These things apply to those
individuals. The benefit system is

619
00:18:38.861 --> 00:18:40.486
individuals. The benefit system is
the most effective way of getting

620
00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.778
the most effective way of getting
money to people quickly to ensure

621
00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:45.486
money to people quickly to ensure
those people can get... So I can be

dear... On the renters. There is a
complete

625
00:18:50.153 --> 00:18:51.486
clear... On the renters. There is a
complete moratorium on evictions

626
00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:52.861
complete moratorium on evictions
which has never happened before. It

627
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:55.861
which has never happened before. It
didn’t happen in 2008 under the last

628
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:56.070
didn’t happen in 2008 under the last
labour

629
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.153
didn’t happen in 2008 under the last
Labour government. This is an

630
00:18:57.153 --> 00:18:58.070
labour government. This is an
unusual step

631
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.153
Labour government. This is an
unusual step we have taken and we

632
00:18:59.153 --> 00:19:00.486
unusual step we have taken and we
have the powers to extend that to

633
00:19:00.486 --> 00:19:06.820
have the powers to extend that to
six months. To be clear on zero—hour

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.695
six months. To be clear on zero-hour
contracts and

00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:08.986

00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:18.778
will be more generous and they ran
access it

643
00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:19.486
will be more generous and they can
access it immediately because they

644
00:19:19.486 --> 00:19:20.278

Universal Credit even though they
are not actually available for work

652
00:19:29.695 --> 00:19:31.861
are not actually available for work
because they are sick? They can get

653
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.278
because they are sick? They ran get
access to

00:19:32.278 --> 00:19:32.861
because they are sick? They can get
access to money immediately, that’s

655
00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.986
access to money immediately, that’s
the most important point. We have

656
00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:38.153
the most important point. We have
another point from Adam Booth, 3 GP

657
00:19:38.153 --> 00:19:40.486
another point from Adam Booth, a GP
in Shrewsbury.

658
00:19:40.486 --> 00:19:42.528
another point from Adam Booth, 3 GP
in Shrewsbury. Good evening. I am a

659
00:19:42.528 --> 00:19:43.486
in Shrewsbury. Good evening. I am a
[oral GP

660
00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:44.278
in Shrewsbury. Good evening. I am a
local GP and unfortunately I have

661
00:19:44.278 --> 00:19:45.278
[oral GP and unfortunately I have
had to

662
00:19:45.278 --> 00:19:46.070
local GP and unfortunately I have
had to self—isolate for the past

663
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.278
had to self-isolate for the past
week

664
00:19:46.278 --> 00:19:47.986
had to self—isolate for the past
week and a half. I have not been

665
00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.445
week and a half. I have not been
able to get remote access to be able

666
00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:53.445
able to get remote access to be able
to work from home, there has been no

667
00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:55.028
to work from home, there has been no
testing for NHS staff and my

668
00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.778
testing for NHS staff and my
colleagues on the front line have

669
00:19:57.778 --> 00:20:01.611
colleagues on the front line have
had to go and buy their own scrubs

670
00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:03.861
had to go and buy their own scrubs
and eye equipment from DIY stores

671
00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:04.861
and eye equipment from DIY stores
because the personal protective

672
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:07.653
because the personal protective
equipment has not been adequate. I

673
00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:09.403
equipment has not been adequate. I
would have thought that these were

674
00:20:09.403 --> 00:20:11.320
would have thought that these were
problems that could be anticipated

675
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:11.403
problams that could be anticipated
and

676
00:20:11.403 --> 00:20:15.695
problems that could be anticipated
and dealt with in advance. I would

677
00:20:15.695 --> 00:20:18.195
and dealt with in advance. I would
like to know what specific problems

678
00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:18.403
like to know what specific problams
peopla

679
00:20:18.403 --> 00:20:20.278
like to know what specific problems
people expect the NHS to have in the

680
00:20:20.278 --> 00:20:23.320
people expect the NHS to have in the
next few weeks and months and what

681
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.070
next few weeks and months and what
they think ran

682
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.028
next few weeks and months and what
they think can be done in advance to

683
00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:25.361
they think ran be done in advance to
sort them

684
00:20:25.361 --> 00:20:28.611
they think can be done in advance to
sort them out. Richard, there are

685
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:30.861
sort them out. Richard, there are
two aspects to this. First, how have

686
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:32.861
two aspects to this. First, how have
we got to this point and was enough

687
00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:35.070
we got to this point and was enough
done to stop it, and is there

688
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.236
done to stop it, and is there
anything coming down the track we

689
00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.778
anything coming down the track we
need to prepare for now? First of

690
00:20:39.778 --> 00:20:45.195
need to prepare for now? First of
all, I receive 20 or 30 messages a

691
00:20:45.195 --> 00:20:47.278
all, I receive 20 or 30 messages a
day from front line NHS workers

692
00:20:47.278 --> 00:20:48.236
day from front line NHS workers
across the country telling stories

693
00:20:48.236 --> 00:20:48.861
across the country telling stories
"TY

694
00:20:48.861 --> 00:20:51.486
across the country telling stories
very similar to what Adam was just

695
00:20:51.486 --> 00:20:55.861
very similar to what Adam was just
telling us. Honestly, I’m sorry to

696
00:20:55.861 --> 00:20:56.445
telling us. Honestly, I’m sorry to
55V

697
00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:59.111
telling us. Honestly, I’m sorry to
say this, it is a national scandal.

698
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:01.403
say this, it is a national scandal.
We shouldn’t be in this position. We

699
00:21:01.403 --> 00:21:03.611
We shouldn’t be in this position. We
knew in the last week of January

700
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:04.236
knew in the last week of january
that

701
00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:05.945
knew in the last week of January
that this was coming. The message

702
00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:09.736
that this was coming. The message
from China was absolutely clear,

703
00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.695
from China was absolutely clear,
that a new virus with pandemic

704
00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:15.320
that a new virus with pandemic
potential was hitting cities, people

705
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.236
potential was hitting cities, people
were being admitted to hospital,

706
00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.861
were being admitted to hospital,
admitted to intensive care units and

707
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:21.903
admitted to intensive rare units and
dying, and the

708
00:21:21.903 --> 00:21:22.320
admitted to intensive care units and
dying, and the mortality was

709
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.861
dying, and the mortality was
growing. We knew that 11 weeks ago

710
00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:27.445
growing. We knew that 11 weeks ago
and then we wasted February when we

711
00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:29.945
and then we wasted February when we
could have acted. Time when we could

712
00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:32.778
could have acted. Time when we could
have amped up testing, time when we

713
00:21:32.778 --> 00:21:34.695
have amped up testing, time when we
could have got personal protective

714
00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:36.445
could have got personal protective
equipment ready and disseminated and

715
00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:39.611
equipment ready and disseminated and
we didn’t do it. I am hearing that

716
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:40.236
we didn’t do it. I am hearing that
not just a

717
00:21:40.236 --> 00:21:41.486
we didn’t do it. I am hearing that
notjust a personal protective

718
00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:41.611
not just a personal protective
equipment

719
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:42.861
notjust a personal protective
equipment is not available, it is

720
00:21:42.861 --> 00:21:45.278
equipment is not available, it is
the wrong kind of personal

721
00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:47.778
the wrong kind of personal
protective equipment. What we have

722
00:21:47.778 --> 00:21:48.820
protective equipment. what we have
is not

723
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.695
protective equipment. What we have
is not even WHO standard. We are

724
00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:52.903
is not even WHO standard. We are
putting our health workers, who we

725
00:21:52.903 --> 00:21:54.653
putting our health workers, who we
have just all applauded

726
00:21:54.653 --> 00:21:55.111
putting our health workers, who we
havejust all applauded here, in

727
00:21:55.111 --> 00:21:55.278
putting our health workers, who we
have just all applauded here, in the

728
00:21:55.278 --> 00:21:57.778
have just all applauded here, in the
front lines without the armour they

729
00:21:57.778 --> 00:21:59.486
front lines without the armour they
need to defend themselves. They are

730
00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:02.778
need to defend themselves. They are
wearing surgical masks which are not

731
00:22:02.778 --> 00:22:04.361
wearing surgical masks which are not
WHO standard, they wear thin plastic

732
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:06.153
WHO standard, they wear thin plastic
aprons which are not standard and

733
00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:07.903
aprons which are not standard and
they are wearing rubber gloves that

734
00:22:07.903 --> 00:22:09.486
they are wearing mbber gloves that
only cover

735
00:22:09.486 --> 00:22:10.195
they are wearing rubber gloves that
only cover their wrists, exposing

736
00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:14.486
only cover their wrists, exposing
their arms to danger and jeopardy.

737
00:22:14.486 --> 00:22:16.903
their arms to danger and jeopardy.
That is nothing short of a national

738
00:22:16.903 --> 00:22:20.736
That is nothing short of a national
scandal. How could we allow this to

739
00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:24.278
scandal. How could we allow this to
happen? The hypocrisy of clapping

740
00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:25.486
happen? The hypocrisy of clapping
NHS workers and yet the government

741
00:22:25.486 --> 00:22:26.861
NHS workers and yet the government
not supporting them to go into that

742
00:22:26.861 --> 00:22:32.236
not supporting them to go into that
front line is tragic, and it was

743
00:22:32.236 --> 00:22:34.778
front line is tragic, and it was
preventable, I am sorry to say but

744
00:22:34.778 --> 00:22:38.986
preventable, I am sorry to say but
it was preventable. We had the

745
00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:40.403
it was preventable. We had the
Secretary of State for Health on the

746
00:22:40.403 --> 00:22:42.028
Secretary of State for Health on the
programme last week and I questioned

747
00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:44.695
programme last week and I questioned
him pretty closely about supply of

748
00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:48.528
him pretty closely about supply of
equipment. Matt Hancock was saying

749
00:22:48.528 --> 00:22:52.861
equipment. Matt Hancock was saying
in innumerable numbers of lorries

750
00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:55.028
in innumerable numbers of lorries
would be out over the weekend, this

751
00:22:55.028 --> 00:22:58.320
would be out over the weekend, this
was last Thursday, and he said by

752
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.945
was last Thursday, and he said by
Sunday, all hospitals would have

753
00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:00.778
Sunday, all hospitals would have
sufficient personal protective

754
00:23:00.778 --> 00:23:02.820
sufficient personal protective
equipment and here we are one week

755
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.611
equipment and here we are one week
on and know they don’t. You have

756
00:23:04.611 --> 00:23:07.486
on and know they don’t. You have
heard what Richard had to say. This

757
00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:10.070
heard what Richard had to say. This
is a big challenge but we are

758
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.278
is a big challenge but we are
ramping up supply rapidly. I’m sorry

759
00:23:11.278 --> 00:23:13.111
ramping up supply rapidly. I’m sorry
to hear of the problem at Shrewsbury

760
00:23:13.111 --> 00:23:16.028
to hear of the problem at Shrewsbury
Hospital. You can’t be surprised by

761
00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:17.778
Hospital. You can’t be surprised by
what you have heard because we have

762
00:23:17.778 --> 00:23:20.695
what you have heard because we have
been hearing it since last week. I

763
00:23:20.695 --> 00:23:22.320
been hearing it since last week. I
am hearing it myself and I am a

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.320
am hearing it myself and I am a

00:23:34.195 --> 00:23:35.820
hospitals but to care homes,
pharmacies, GPs, those in homeless

779
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.695
pharmacies, GPs, those in homeless
shelters and other important

780
00:23:36.695 --> 00:23:39.486
shelters and other important
settings. We are now getting

781
00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:40.945
settings. We are now getting
significant quantities, tens of

782
00:23:40.945 --> 00:23:43.320
significant quantities, tens of
millions of treatment items from

783
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.320
millions of treatment items from
gloves and face mask and other items

784
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.986
gloves and face mask and other items
of PPE ﬂowing

785
00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:48.486
gloves and face mask and other items
of PPE flowing through. This has now

786
00:23:48.486 --> 00:23:49.195
of PPE ﬂowing through. This has now
become a

787
00:23:49.195 --> 00:23:50.570
of PPE flowing through. This has now
become a military operation for us.

788
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.820
become a military operation for us.
We have seen pictures of the Armed

789
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.986
We have seen pictures of the Armed
Forces delivering this to hospitals.

790
00:23:54.986 --> 00:23:58.153
Forces delivering this to hospitals.
Richard is shaking his head.

791
00:23:58.153 --> 00:23:58.320
Richard is shaking his head.
SuppUes

792
00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.153
Richard is shaking his head.
Supplies are flowing through to

793
00:23:59.153 --> 00:24:01.320
Supplies are ﬂowing through to
hospitals.

794
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.361
Supplies are flowing through to
hospitals. Robert, can you tell us

795
00:24:03.361 --> 00:24:03.778
hospitals. Robert, ran you tell us
tonight, there

796
00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:05.695
hospitals. Robert, can you tell us
tonight, there will be a number of

797
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.445
tonight, there will be a number of
GPs and those working in the health

798
00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:07.778
GPs and those working in the health
rare system

799
00:24:07.778 --> 00:24:08.820
GPs and those working in the health
care system watching at home, when

800
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.528
rare system watching at home, when
do you think

801
00:24:09.528 --> 00:24:10.653
care system watching at home, when
do you think people who need it in

802
00:24:10.653 --> 00:24:12.445
do you think people who need it in
the health system will have the

803
00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:15.778
the health system will have the
correct and sufficient personal

804
00:24:15.778 --> 00:24:16.820
correct and sufficient personal
protective equipment, when will that

805
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.153
protective equipment, when will that
be? I can’t give you an exact time.

806
00:24:20.153 --> 00:24:25.111
be? I can’t give you an exact time.
So you don’t know? What I do know is

807
00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:26.236
So you don’t know? what I do know is
in the last

808
00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:28.653
So you don’t know? What I do know is
in the last 48 hours, 25 million

809
00:24:28.653 --> 00:24:30.653
in the last 48 hours, 25 million
packs of gloves have been delivered

810
00:24:30.653 --> 00:24:35.403
packs of gloves have been delivered
and 15 million facemasks. Almost 2

811
00:24:35.403 --> 00:24:37.861
and 15 million facemasks. Almost 2
million items of eye protection.

812
00:24:37.861 --> 00:24:39.028
million items of eye protection.
These are large quantities. We

813
00:24:39.028 --> 00:24:40.445
These are large quantities. We
probably need much more than that

814
00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:43.695
probably need much more than that
but we are ramping it up. Robert,

815
00:24:43.695 --> 00:24:46.903
but we are ramping it up. Robert,
listen, I know what you think you

816
00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:48.570
listen, I know what you think you
are saying is true, I know that you

817
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.528
are saying is true, I know that you
believe it but it it simply not

818
00:24:50.528 --> 00:24:50.736
believe it but it it simply not
tme.

819
00:24:50.736 --> 00:24:52.445
believe it but it it simply not
true. These are the messages I have

820
00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:54.611
tme. These are the messages I have
had today. The

821
00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:55.528
true. These are the messages I have
had today. The lack of clear

822
00:24:55.528 --> 00:24:58.611
had today. The lack of clear
guidance on testing is causing huge

823
00:24:58.611 --> 00:24:59.861
guidance on testing is causing huge
anxiety. Totally inadequate PPE.

824
00:24:59.861 --> 00:25:03.361
anxiety. Totally inadequate PPE.
Being sent like lambs to the

825
00:25:03.361 --> 00:25:06.820
Being sent like lambs to the
slaughter. Inadequate PPE. No scrubs

826
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.403
slaughter. Inadequate PPE. No scrubs
and no testing equipment.

827
00:25:08.403 --> 00:25:09.486
and no testing equipment.
Sleepwalking into this totally

828
00:25:09.486 --> 00:25:10.653
Sleepwalking into this totally
unequipped and no prepared when we

829
00:25:10.653 --> 00:25:12.695
unequipped and no prepared when we
had the luxury of two months to

830
00:25:12.695 --> 00:25:14.861
had the luxury of two months to
prepare that other countries didn’t.

831
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:16.945
prepare that other countries didn’t.
That’s why it is a national scandal.

832
00:25:16.945 --> 00:25:18.820
That’s why it is a national scandal.
We need to get much more equipment

833
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.236
We need to get much more equipment
out there and it is happening.

834
00:25:22.236 --> 00:25:24.236
out there and it is happening.
Primarily now PPE is a logistical

835
00:25:24.236 --> 00:25:25.861
Primarily now PPE is a logistical
question. We have very large stocks

836
00:25:25.861 --> 00:25:27.861
question. We have very large stocks
and we need to get it to the front

837
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:29.903
and we need to get it to the front
line. On testing, we are increasing

838
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:31.361
line. On testing, we are increasing
the amount of testing available and

839
00:25:31.361 --> 00:25:33.778
the amount of testing available and
again we need to go further because

840
00:25:33.778 --> 00:25:35.403
again we need to go further because
this is all about testing. One day

841
00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:38.486
this is all about testing. One day
last week I think we reached 8000

842
00:25:38.486 --> 00:25:39.736
last week I think we reached 8000
tests. We are averaging somewhat

843
00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:43.695
tests. We are averaging somewhat
below that and we want to get up to

844
00:25:43.695 --> 00:25:45.945
below that and we want to get up to
10,000, and ultimately 25000 and

845
00:25:45.945 --> 00:25:48.778
10,000, and ultimately 25000 and
then 250,000. There is a huge effort

846
00:25:48.778 --> 00:25:50.736
then 250,000. There is a huge effort
to be done. 0n the antibody test,

847
00:25:50.736 --> 00:25:52.778
to be done. On the antibody test,
the test for people who have already

848
00:25:52.778 --> 00:25:53.820
the test for peopla who have already
had it,

849
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.320
the test for people who have already
had it, there we have already

850
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.486
had it, there we have already
ordered 3.5 million of those tests.

851
00:25:57.486 --> 00:26:00.820
ordered 3.5 million of those tests.
We are testing that test to ensure

852
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.236
We are testing that test to ensure
it is reliable. As the Chief Medical

853
00:26:03.236 --> 00:26:04.528
it is reliable. As the Chief Medical
Officer has said, that is very

854
00:26:04.528 --> 00:26:06.028
Officer has said, that is very
important, there is nothing worse

855
00:26:06.028 --> 00:26:07.361
important, there is nothing worse
than an unreliable test, but if we

856
00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:09.695
than an unreliable test, but if we
prove it is reliable then we have

857
00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:11.111
prove it is reliable then we have
millions of those flowing and within

858
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:11.486
millions of those ﬂowing and within
weeks they

859
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:14.611
millions of those flowing and within
weeks they should be in the system.

860
00:26:14.611 --> 00:26:16.361
weeks they should be in the system.
Sticking to the personal protective

861
00:26:16.361 --> 00:26:17.945
Sticking to the personal protective
equipment for the moment, because

862
00:26:17.945 --> 00:26:20.278
equipment for the moment, because
that is what Adam was asking about.

863
00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:23.278
that is what Adam was asking about.
Humphrey, what is your view? What I

864
00:26:23.278 --> 00:26:25.070
Humphrey, what is your view? what I
have to say to

865
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.278
Humphrey, what is your view? What I
have to say to Adam, again, a huge

866
00:26:26.278 --> 00:26:28.653
have to say to Adam, again, a huge
thank you for everything he and the

867
00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:31.320
thank you for everything he and the
hundreds of thousands of GPs who are

868
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.695
hundreds of thousands of GPs who are
in many situations in the front line

869
00:26:32.695 --> 00:26:35.695
in many situations in the front line
of what is happening here. I have

870
00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:37.861
of what is happening here. I have
good friends who are GPs who are

871
00:26:37.861 --> 00:26:39.820
good friends who are GPs who are
doing tests of patients and checking

872
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.695
doing tests of patients and checking
them in the car parks of surgeries

873
00:26:41.695 --> 00:26:41.861
them in the rar parks of surgeries
because

874
00:26:41.861 --> 00:26:44.278
them in the car parks of surgeries
because it is not safe to bring them

875
00:26:44.278 --> 00:26:47.403
because it is not safe to bring them
inside, and they are working double,

876
00:26:47.403 --> 00:26:47.778
inside, and they are working doubla,
tripla and

877
00:26:47.778 --> 00:26:48.236
inside, and they are working double,
triple and quadruple shift

878
00:26:48.236 --> 00:26:50.070
triple and quadruple shift
sometimes. A huge thank you to what

879
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.903
sometimes. A huge thank you to what
is going on in that regard. I have

880
00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:55.153
is going on in that regard. I have
to say I have a lot of sympathy with

881
00:26:55.153 --> 00:26:56.820
to say I have a lot of sympathy with
the views Richard expressed. It is

882
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.445
the views Richard expressed. It is
hard to understand why we got caught

883
00:27:00.445 --> 00:27:00.778
hard to understand why we got taught
as short

884
00:27:00.778 --> 00:27:03.903
hard to understand why we got caught
as short as we did in this crisis.

885
00:27:03.903 --> 00:27:04.070
as short as we did in this crisis.
Why

886
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.445
as short as we did in this crisis.
why we didn’t

887
00:27:04.445 --> 00:27:08.695
as short as we did in this crisis.
Why we didn’t have the foresight to

888
00:27:08.695 --> 00:27:09.861
Why we didn’t have the foresight to
understand more and take the steps

889
00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:13.861
understand more and take the steps
we could have taken with equipment,

890
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:15.528
we could have taken with equipment,
tests and many other aspects of what

891
00:27:15.528 --> 00:27:18.236
tests and many other aspects of what
we need to be ready for this. I’m

892
00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:19.653
we need to be ready for this. I’m
not talking about long—range

893
00:27:19.653 --> 00:27:19.986
not talking about long-range
planning

894
00:27:19.986 --> 00:27:21.736
not talking about long—range
planning over two or three years,

895
00:27:21.736 --> 00:27:23.361
planning over two or three years,
I’m saying when we saw it happen in

896
00:27:23.361 --> 00:27:25.861
I’m saying when we saw it happen in
China and then Italy so close to

897
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:27.778
China and then Italy so close to
home. I have good friends in Italy

898
00:27:27.778 --> 00:27:29.903
home. I have good friends in Italy
who hi have been speaking to on the

899
00:27:29.903 --> 00:27:31.611
who hi have been speaking to on the
phone since late January and early

900
00:27:31.611 --> 00:27:32.028
phone since late january and earty
February and

901
00:27:32.028 --> 00:27:33.195
phone since late January and early
February and it was very clear what

902
00:27:33.195 --> 00:27:35.070
February and it was very clear what
was happening. I think the

903
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.945
was happening. I think the
government has to take away these

904
00:27:36.945 --> 00:27:38.945
government has to take away these
lessons from that. Of course, that

905
00:27:38.945 --> 00:27:39.403
lassons from that. Of course, that
doesn’t help

906
00:27:39.403 --> 00:27:40.778
lessons from that. Of course, that
doesn’t help now, now it is about

907
00:27:40.778 --> 00:27:42.236
doesn’t help now, now it is about
getting stuff through the front

908
00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:43.695
getting stuff through the front
line. That is a logistics and

909
00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.945
line. That is a logistics and
business problem and I know a little

910
00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:46.528
business problem and I know a little
bit about those things will stop

911
00:27:46.528 --> 00:27:48.528
bit about those things will stop
it’s about making sure you have so

912
00:27:48.528 --> 00:27:49.986
it’s about making sure you have so
much focus on managing the supply

913
00:27:49.986 --> 00:27:50.653
much focus on managing the supply
and ﬂow

914
00:27:50.653 --> 00:27:52.236
much focus on managing the supply
and flow of product and I hope the

915
00:27:52.236 --> 00:27:52.695
and ﬂow of product and I hope the
government is

916
00:27:52.695 --> 00:27:54.528
and flow of product and I hope the
government is getting the best help

917
00:27:54.528 --> 00:27:54.861
government is getting the best help
it ran

918
00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:56.070
government is getting the best help
it can there because that absolutely

919
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.445
it ran there because that absolutely
is a

920
00:27:56.445 --> 00:27:58.986
it can there because that absolutely
is a solvable problem stop if there

921
00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:00.903
is a solvable problem stop if there
are 30 million pairs of gloves in

922
00:28:00.903 --> 00:28:01.861
are 30 million pairs of gloves in
the country then they absolutely

923
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:04.403
the country then they absolutely
should and could be with people in

924
00:28:04.403 --> 00:28:05.278
should and could be with peopla in
the front

925
00:28:05.278 --> 00:28:06.986
should and could be with people in
the front line so let’s get that

926
00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:09.195
the front line so let’s get that
done. A tweet from Christopher Luke,

927
00:28:09.195 --> 00:28:10.986
done. A tweet from Christopher Luke,
a psychiatric nurse working on an

928
00:28:10.986 --> 00:28:12.486
a psychiatric nurse working on an
acute mental health what will stop

929
00:28:12.486 --> 00:28:13.653
acute mental health what will stop
myself and many colleagues feel

930
00:28:13.653 --> 00:28:16.278
myself and many colleagues feel
patients and staff have been all but

931
00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:18.945
patients and staff have been all but

932
00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:21.945
forgotten about. We have very little
in the way of PPE, personal

00:28:21.945 --> 00:28:23.111
in the way of PPE, personal
protective equipment, and mental

Covid-19 and there has been no
coverage

00:28:29.028 --> 00:28:30.903
Covid—19 and there has been no
coverage about how mental health

940
00:28:30.903 --> 00:28:31.653
coverage about how mental health
hospitals are coping. What

941
00:28:31.653 --> 00:28:33.945
hospitals are coping. What
provisions are being made for staff

provisions are being made for staff
and patients in psychiatric

the level of risk we work with a

the level of risk we work with a
side from the risk of catching

946
00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:45.986
side from the risk of catching
Covid—19. Absolutely. We ask people

947
00:28:45.986 --> 00:28:47.986
Covid-19. Absolutely. We ask peopla
to do

948
00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:49.195
Covid—19. Absolutely. We ask people
to do everything to look after us at

949
00:28:49.195 --> 00:28:51.820
to do everything to look after us at
our most vulnerable. We applaud

950
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.611
our most vulnerable. We applaud
them, we love them, we love their

951
00:28:54.611 --> 00:28:54.778
them, we love them, we love their
self-sacrifice,

952
00:28:54.778 --> 00:28:55.903
them, we love them, we love their
self—sacrifice, but we don’t seem to

953
00:28:55.903 --> 00:28:57.236
self-sacrifice, but we don’t seem to
be able to

954
00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:57.986
self—sacrifice, but we don’t seem to
be able to provide the most basic

and they may also be spreading it,

979
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.945
and they may also be spreading it,
which is the last thing they want to

980
00:29:41.945 --> 00:29:43.986
which is the last thing they want to
be. People going into A&E, working

981
00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:44.528
be. People going into AaE, working
there,

982
00:29:44.528 --> 00:29:45.570
be. People going into A&E, working
there, cleaning in there, the last

983
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.070
there, cleaning in there, the last
thing they want to do is be part of

984
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.653
thing they want to do is be part of
the problem. They want to be part of

985
00:29:49.653 --> 00:29:51.278
the problem. They want to be part of
the solution and if we are not able

986
00:29:51.278 --> 00:29:53.778
the solution and if we are not able
to provide those basic things then

987
00:29:53.778 --> 00:29:54.278
to provide those basic things then
dearty we

988
00:29:54.278 --> 00:29:55.320
to provide those basic things then
clearly we have a problem. But I

989
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.820
dearty we have a problem. But I
actually think

990
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.861
clearly we have a problem. But I
actually think it is about testing.

991
00:29:57.861 --> 00:30:02.111
actually think it is about testing.
The head of the WHO said this is all

992
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:03.403
The head of the WHO said this is all
about test, test, test. The

993
00:30:03.403 --> 00:30:05.236
about test, test, test. The
government might have 3.5 million

994
00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.445
government might have 3.5 million
tests to find out if we have had it,

995
00:30:07.445 --> 00:30:10.986
tests to find out if we have had it,
we should have had those sorts of

996
00:30:10.986 --> 00:30:12.361
we should have had those sorts of
numbers, surely, for tests as to

997
00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:13.653
numbers, surely, for tests as to
whether or not people actually have

998
00:30:13.653 --> 00:30:14.611
whether or not peopla actually have
it at the

999
00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:15.778
whether or not people actually have
it at the moment so we can know

1000
00:30:15.778 --> 00:30:16.028
it at the moment so we ran know
whether or

1001
00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:18.028
it at the moment so we can know
whether or not they ought to be

1002
00:30:18.028 --> 00:30:20.611
whether or not they ought to be
working in A&E or whether they are

1003
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:22.570
working in “IE or whether they are
spreading it.

1004
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.403
working in A&E or whether they are
spreading it. How can we possibly

1005
00:30:23.403 --> 00:30:23.778
spreading it. How ran we possibly
work out

1006
00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:24.945
spreading it. How can we possibly
work out who is catching it and who

1007
00:30:24.945 --> 00:30:26.653
work out who is catching it and who
we might have given it to if we

1008
00:30:26.653 --> 00:30:29.195
we might have given it to if we
don’t know we have had it ourselves?

1009
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:31.695
don’t know we have had it ourselves?
So many people are not even asked to

1010
00:30:31.695 --> 00:30:32.111
So many people are not even asked to
all

1011
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:32.528
So many people are not even asked to
(211111 but

1012
00:30:32.528 --> 00:30:34.611
So many people are not even asked to
call 111 but to look up online the

1013
00:30:34.611 --> 00:30:34.820
(211111 but to look up online the
symptoms

1014
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.236
call 111 but to look up online the
symptoms and then self—isolate. As a

1015
00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:37.111
symptoms and then self-isolate. As a
country at the

1016
00:30:37.111 --> 00:30:38.445
symptoms and then self—isolate. As a
country at the moment we don’t seem

1017
00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:40.861
country at the moment we don’t seem
to have any idea really apart from

1018
00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:43.361
to have any idea really apart from
deaths as to how many people even

1019
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:45.528
deaths as to how many people even
have the disease, which does make it

1020
00:30:45.528 --> 00:30:47.445
have the disease, which does make it
really difficult to manage.

1021
00:30:52.361 --> 00:31:02.445
That is a good point. We saw the
research coming out from Oxford. As

1022
00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:04.861
research coming out from Oxford. As
a statistician earlier in my life I

1023
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:05.278
a statistician eartier in my life I
thought we

1024
00:31:05.278 --> 00:31:06.070
a statistician earlier in my life I
thought we could have at least

1025
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.611
thought we could have at least
worked out some tests in the country

1026
00:31:07.611 --> 00:31:09.653
worked out some tests in the country
to give us at least a guide to what

1027
00:31:09.653 --> 00:31:11.903
to give us at least a guide to what
the penetration rate of the virus is

1028
00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:12.986
the penetration rate of the virus is
and that would be enormously

1029
00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:18.195
and that would be enormously
helpful. When we knew this was

1030
00:31:18.195 --> 00:31:18.528
helpful. when we knew this was
coming late

1031
00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:20.695
helpful. When we knew this was
coming late January, early February,

1032
00:31:20.695 --> 00:31:21.195
coming late january, earty Febmary,
the

1033
00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:22.153
coming late January, early February,
the standard public health approach

1034
00:31:22.153 --> 00:31:25.028
the standard public health approach
to an epidemic issue test, test,

1035
00:31:25.028 --> 00:31:27.320
to an epidemic issue test, test,
test. Then in an infectious outbreak

1036
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.778
test. Then in an infectious outbreak
you isolate, you quarantine, you

1037
00:31:29.778 --> 00:31:32.153
you isolate, you quarantine, you
contact trays, you track down every

1038
00:31:32.153 --> 00:31:33.153
contact trays, you track down every
singla

1039
00:31:33.153 --> 00:31:33.653
contact trays, you track down every
singlc contact

1040
00:31:33.653 --> 00:31:34.528
contact trays, you track down every
single contact and test that person

1041
00:31:34.528 --> 00:31:34.861
singla contact and test that person
as well

1042
00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:36.278
single contact and test that person
as well to see if you can extinguish

1043
00:31:36.278 --> 00:31:37.278
as well to see if you ran extinguish
and stop the

1044
00:31:37.278 --> 00:31:37.903
as well to see if you can extinguish
and stop the lines of transmission.

1045
00:31:37.903 --> 00:31:40.320
and stop the lines of transmission.
That is the way you stop the

1046
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.153
That is the way you stop the
outbreak. We did not do that. We

1047
00:31:43.153 --> 00:31:43.986
outbreak. We did not do that. We
forgot the most fundamental

1048
00:31:43.986 --> 00:31:44.195
forgot the most fundamental
principlas

1049
00:31:44.195 --> 00:31:46.653
forgot the most fundamental
principles of outbreak control. We

1050
00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:51.778
principlas of outbreak control. We
did do

1051
00:31:52.903 --> 00:31:58.611
did do contact tracing. To begin
with. You are not doing that now. We

1052
00:31:58.611 --> 00:31:59.778
with. You are not doing that now. We
were acting upon expert medical

1053
00:31:59.778 --> 00:32:03.236
were acting upon expert medical
advice and I appreciate they can

1054
00:32:03.236 --> 00:32:03.361
advice and I appreciate they ran
have

1055
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:05.611
advice and I appreciate they can
have differences of opinion, the

1056
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:05.778
have differences of opinion, the
media

1057
00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:06.820
have differences of opinion, the
medics and the scientist. Nothing is

1058
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.153
media and the scientist. Nothing is
dear-cut

1059
00:32:07.153 --> 00:32:08.403
medics and the scientist. Nothing is
clear—cut in a situation like this,

1060
00:32:08.403 --> 00:32:10.236
dear-cut in a situation like this,
but we are

1061
00:32:10.236 --> 00:32:11.111
clear—cut in a situation like this,
but we are guided by them. The

1062
00:32:11.111 --> 00:32:14.111
but we are guided by them. The
contact tracing that was done for

1063
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:17.111
contact tracing that was done for
example from the people coming from

1064
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:19.028
example from the people coming from
China and other areas appeared to be

1065
00:32:19.028 --> 00:32:21.570
China and other areas appeared to be
successful and was held up well by

1066
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.736
successful and was held up well by
international standards. But that

1067
00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:27.570
international standards. But that
did not stop the epidemic, did it?

1068
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.195
did not stop the epidemic, did it?
In fact the strategy we ended up

1069
00:32:30.195 --> 00:32:32.445
In fact the strategy we ended up
following because we wanted to get

1070
00:32:32.445 --> 00:32:33.028
following because we wanted to get
601:

1071
00:32:33.028 --> 00:32:33.820
following because we wanted to get
60% of the population infected

1072
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.945
60% of the population infected
because we made the mistake in

1073
00:32:34.945 --> 00:32:37.153
because we made the mistake in
judgment that we thought it was a

1074
00:32:37.153 --> 00:32:41.028
judgment that we thought it was a
mild infection. The policy the

1075
00:32:41.028 --> 00:32:42.986
mild infection. The policy the
government had, advised by the Chief

1076
00:32:42.986 --> 00:32:45.236
government had, advised by the Chief
Medical Officer and our chief

1077
00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:47.111
Medical Officer and our chief
scientific adviser, is to save as

1078
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:49.111
scientific adviser, is to save as
many people’s lives as possible.

1079
00:32:49.111 --> 00:32:53.153
many people’s lives as possible.
That message changed ten days ago.

1080
00:32:53.153 --> 00:32:54.445
That message changed ten days ago.
In the earty

1081
00:32:54.445 --> 00:32:55.695
That message changed ten days ago.
In the early part of the epidemic it

1082
00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:56.403
In the earty part of the epidemic it
was not

1083
00:32:56.403 --> 00:32:57.986
In the early part of the epidemic it
was not the case that the message

1084
00:32:57.986 --> 00:32:58.778
was not the rase that the message
was protect

1085
00:32:58.778 --> 00:33:00.403
was not the case that the message
was protect the NHS and save lives.

1086
00:33:00.403 --> 00:33:02.945
was protect the NHS and save lives.
The message was, we are going to

1087
00:33:02.945 --> 00:33:05.153
The message was, we are going to
manage an epidemic in the

1088
00:33:05.153 --> 00:33:07.778
manage an epidemic in the
population, get to 60%, get to herd

1089
00:33:07.778 --> 00:33:08.861
population, get to 6096, get to herd
immunity. But

1090
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:09.445
population, get to 60%, get to herd
immunity. But there are many

1091
00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:11.153
immunity. But there are many
examples of people on the record,

1092
00:33:11.153 --> 00:33:14.111
examples of people on the record,
from the chief scientific adviser,

1093
00:33:14.111 --> 00:33:15.736
from the chief scientific adviser,
two statisticians and modellers as

1094
00:33:15.736 --> 00:33:19.611
two statisticians and modellers as
part of the early stage, advising

1095
00:33:19.611 --> 00:33:19.778
part of the earty stage, advising
the

1096
00:33:19.778 --> 00:33:21.445
part of the early stage, advising
the government and saying that was

1097
00:33:21.445 --> 00:33:23.028
the government and saying that was
the objective. Then you stopped it

1098
00:33:23.028 --> 00:33:24.736
the objective. Then you stopped it
when you realise the NHS could not

1099
00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:27.236
when you realise the NHS could not
cope with the intensity. The

1100
00:33:27.236 --> 00:33:28.986
cope with the intensity. The
government policy today is very

1101
00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:29.153
government policy today is very
dear

1102
00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:31.195
government policy today is very
clear that we all need to play a

1103
00:33:31.195 --> 00:33:33.153
clear that we all need to play a
part by staying at home, that is the

1104
00:33:33.153 --> 00:33:35.070
part by staying at home, that is the
best way to protect the NHS and that

1105
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.111
best way to protect the NHS and that
is the way within all of our power

1106
00:33:37.111 --> 00:33:38.445
is the way within all of our power
we ran help to

1107
00:33:38.445 --> 00:33:40.403
is the way within all of our power
we can help to save lives. It is six

1108
00:33:40.403 --> 00:33:40.861
we ran help to save lives. It is six
weeks too

1109
00:33:40.861 --> 00:33:42.361
we can help to save lives. It is six
weeks too late. I accept it is

1110
00:33:42.361 --> 00:33:43.611
weeks too late. I accept it is
government policy now, but don’t you

1111
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:46.070
government policy now, but don’t you
agree that it is ironic as a country

1112
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.820
agree that it is ironic as a country
we are the country that invented the

1113
00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.903
we are the country that invented the
test, but we seem to be the country

1114
00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:52.195
test, but we seem to be the country
without it and everybody else seems

1115
00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:54.736
without it and everybody else seems
to be able to test and yet Britain

1116
00:33:54.736 --> 00:33:56.570
to be able to test and yet Britain
is testing so little. I don’t think

1117
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.028
is testing so little. I don’t think
that is fair. There are countries

1118
00:33:58.028 --> 00:34:00.111
that is fair. There are countries
that have tested more than we have,

1119
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:02.695
that have tested more than we have,
but the testing that we have is

1120
00:34:02.695 --> 00:34:05.903
but the testing that we have is
broadly similar to other major

1121
00:34:05.903 --> 00:34:07.611
broadly similar to other major
countries. Germany has

1122
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:07.861
broadly similar to other major
countries. Germany hasjust

1123
00:34:07.861 --> 00:34:08.028
countries. Germany has just
increased

1124
00:34:08.028 --> 00:34:09.070
countries. Germany hasjust
increased the number of tests. We

1125
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.236
increased the number of tests. We
have heard a lot about the supply

1126
00:34:12.236 --> 00:34:13.195
have heard a lot about the supply
problam,

1127
00:34:13.195 --> 00:34:15.278
have heard a lot about the supply
problem, getting enough test, which

1128
00:34:15.278 --> 00:34:15.445
problam, getting enough test, which
sounds

1129
00:34:15.445 --> 00:34:18.070
problem, getting enough test, which
sounds plausible. Germany somehow

1130
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.486
sounds plausible. Germany somehow
seems to be circumventing that

1131
00:34:19.486 --> 00:34:19.903
seems to be circumventing that
sunplv

1132
00:34:19.903 --> 00:34:21.861
seems to be circumventing that
supply problem and has now increased

1133
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:26.153
supply problem and has now increased
its testing to 500,000 a week. The

1134
00:34:26.153 --> 00:34:28.486
its testing to 500,000 a week. The
UK has tested 90,000 overall. How is

1135
00:34:28.486 --> 00:34:30.361
UK has tested 90,000 overall. How is
Germany getting past the supply

1136
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:32.945
Germany getting past the supply
problem and we are not? What we are

1137
00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:34.486
problem and we are not? what we are
trying to do is to

1138
00:34:34.486 --> 00:34:34.820
problem and we are not? What we are
trying to do is to ramp up

1139
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.986
trying to do is to ramp up
production as quickly as we can.

1140
00:34:37.986 --> 00:34:38.611
production as quickly as we ran.
Everyone

1141
00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:40.278
production as quickly as we can.
Everyone understands the NHS, the

1142
00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.278
Everyone understands the NHS, the
Department of Health, the industry,

1143
00:34:41.278 --> 00:34:44.278
Department of Health, the industry,
is working as hard as possible, we

1144
00:34:44.278 --> 00:34:45.778
is working as hard as possible, we
are working around the clock to do

1145
00:34:45.778 --> 00:34:49.195
are working around the clock to do
this, nobody is going slow on this.

1146
00:34:49.195 --> 00:34:52.070
this, nobody is going slow on this.
No one is suggesting that. There is

1147
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.028
No one is suggesting that. There is
reason to believe the testing will

1148
00:34:55.028 --> 00:34:56.111
reason to believe the testing will
be able to step up quite

1149
00:34:56.111 --> 00:35:00.236
be able to step up quite
significantly in the next week or

1150
00:35:00.236 --> 00:35:02.611
significantly in the next week or
so, it is going in a positive

1151
00:35:02.611 --> 00:35:04.611
so, it is going in a positive
direction on that. Then there is the

1152
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:06.361
direction on that. Then there is the
potential of the antibody test and

1153
00:35:06.361 --> 00:35:08.778
potential of the antibody test and
there are millions of those that are

1154
00:35:08.778 --> 00:35:10.861
there are millions of those that are
available, if it can be proven to be

1155
00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:11.236
availabla, if it ran be proven to be
reliabla, and

1156
00:35:11.236 --> 00:35:13.111
available, if it can be proven to be
reliable, and that could be a game

1157
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:13.986
reliabla, and that could be a game
changer. Let’s

1158
00:35:13.986 --> 00:35:14.445
reliable, and that could be a game
changer. Let’s take another

1159
00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.153
changer. Let’s take another
question. There are so many

1160
00:35:16.153 --> 00:35:17.070
question. There are so many
different aspects of this whole

1161
00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.111
different aspects of this whole
thing that we need to talk about.

1162
00:35:19.111 --> 00:35:22.986
thing that we need to talk about.
Let’s hear from Joanne,

1163
00:35:22.986 --> 00:35:25.778
thing that we need to talk about.
Let’s hearfrom Joanne, who is from

1164
00:35:25.778 --> 00:35:25.861
Let’s hear from joanne, who is from
Shrewsbury,

1165
00:35:25.861 --> 00:35:27.070
Let’s hearfrom Joanne, who is from
Shrewsbury, who is an NHS

1166
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:31.153
Shrewsbury, who is an NHS
administrator. Has the lack of

1167
00:35:31.153 --> 00:35:32.611
administrator. Has the lack of
clarity and government guidance led

1168
00:35:32.611 --> 00:35:34.570
clarity and government guidance led
to a situation where companies and

1169
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.195
to a situation where companies and
peopla ran

1170
00:35:36.195 --> 00:35:38.195
to a situation where companies and
people can deliberately or

1171
00:35:38.195 --> 00:35:39.570
people can deliberately or
unintentionally misinterpret the

1172
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.611
unintentionally misinterpret the
mles.

1173
00:35:40.611 --> 00:35:42.611
unintentionally misinterpret the
rules. For example, construction

1174
00:35:42.611 --> 00:35:43.153
mles. For example, constmction
companies and

1175
00:35:43.153 --> 00:35:44.195
rules. For example, construction
companies and nonessential shops

1176
00:35:44.195 --> 00:35:45.195
companies and nonessential shops
stay open, leading to crowded

1177
00:35:45.195 --> 00:35:47.028
stay open, leading to crowded
transport and continuing with social

1178
00:35:47.028 --> 00:35:51.236
transport and continuing with social
gatherings. Humphrey, what is your

1179
00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:54.570
gatherings. Humphrey, what is your
view on this? It is a good question

1180
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.236
view on this? It is a good question
from joanne.

1181
00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:56.320
view on this? It is a good question
from Joanne. From my point of view,

1182
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.611
from joanne. From my point of view,
there was

1183
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:58.028
from Joanne. From my point of view,
there was no lack of clarity at all

1184
00:35:58.028 --> 00:35:59.778
there was no lack of clarity at all
in terms of what came through an

1185
00:35:59.778 --> 00:36:01.486
in terms of what came through an
acrylic to the government and the

1186
00:36:01.486 --> 00:36:03.736
acrylic to the government and the
Prime Minister. He was crystal clear

1187
00:36:03.736 --> 00:36:05.403
Prime Minister. He was crystal clear
when he wanted things to change in

1188
00:36:05.403 --> 00:36:07.653
when he wanted things to change in
the last week or so. There are

1189
00:36:07.653 --> 00:36:09.986
the last week or so. There are
questions about whether earlier in

1190
00:36:09.986 --> 00:36:10.403
questions about whether eartier in
the process

1191
00:36:10.403 --> 00:36:11.486
questions about whether earlier in
the process things were quite as

1192
00:36:11.486 --> 00:36:13.653
the process things were quite as
clear, but we were left in no doubt

1193
00:36:13.653 --> 00:36:15.028
clear, but we were left in no doubt
when Friday night came that we had

1194
00:36:15.028 --> 00:36:18.236
when Friday night came that we had
to cease operating and do it

1195
00:36:18.236 --> 00:36:19.778
to cease operating and do it
quickly. I don’t think there was any

1196
00:36:19.778 --> 00:36:22.528
quickly. I don’t think there was any
doubt for people on Monday night

1197
00:36:22.528 --> 00:36:22.778
doubt for peopla on Monday night
about

1198
00:36:22.778 --> 00:36:24.736
doubt for people on Monday night
about the seriousness of the message

1199
00:36:24.736 --> 00:36:26.486
about the seriousness of the message
that the Prime Minister was sending

1200
00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:30.153
that the Prime Minister was sending
to everybody in the country, and the

1201
00:36:30.153 --> 00:36:32.778
to everybody in the country, and the
expectations that he said, that we

1202
00:36:32.778 --> 00:36:34.611
expectations that he said, that we
really do stay—at—home and only

1203
00:36:34.611 --> 00:36:35.986
really do stay—at—home and only
essential work or essential travel

1204
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:38.778
essential work or essential travel
should be undertaken. For some time

1205
00:36:38.778 --> 00:36:41.070
should be undertaken. For some time
prior to our closure we had been

1206
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.861
prior to our closure we had been
working predominantly, in fact

1207
00:36:42.861 --> 00:36:46.778
working predominantly, in fact
overwhelmingly, from the point of

1208
00:36:46.778 --> 00:36:48.153
overwhelmingly, from the point of
view from our offices by

1209
00:36:48.153 --> 00:36:50.028
view from our offices by
home—working and we had trialled

1210
00:36:50.028 --> 00:36:50.445
home-working and we had trialled
that to

1211
00:36:50.445 --> 00:36:51.653
home—working and we had trialled
that to check that we were able to

1212
00:36:51.653 --> 00:36:54.570
that to check that we were able to
do that and all the technology work.

1213
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.736
do that and all the technology work.
We moved all our technology people

1214
00:36:56.736 --> 00:37:00.111
We moved all our technology people
out, on our website we reset all our

1215
00:37:00.111 --> 00:37:02.195
out, on our website we reset all our
CCTV operations, so we were well

1216
00:37:02.195 --> 00:37:04.153
CCTV operations, so we were well
prepared for it. I think it is very

1217
00:37:04.153 --> 00:37:05.820
prepared for it. I think it is very
important that the guidance is clear

1218
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.028
important that the guidance is clear
and I think it is important that

1219
00:37:08.028 --> 00:37:09.861
and I think it is important that
there is some enforcement behind it

1220
00:37:09.861 --> 00:37:12.070
there is some enforcement behind it
as well. It is very clear if you

1221
00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.361
as well. It is very clear if you
read the established literature that

1222
00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:15.611
read the established literature that
if we are going to suppress this

1223
00:37:15.611 --> 00:37:19.445
if we are going to suppress this
virus and really bear down on spread

1224
00:37:19.445 --> 00:37:20.945
virus and really bear down on spread
and get the vital number well below

1225
00:37:20.945 --> 00:37:24.695
and get the vital number well below
zero, we have to accept a period,

1226
00:37:24.695 --> 00:37:26.778
zero, we have to accept a period,
Richard will echo this, we have to

1227
00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:28.195
Richard will echo this, we have to
accept a period of really tight

1228
00:37:28.195 --> 00:37:29.111
accept a period of really tight
dose

1229
00:37:29.111 --> 00:37:31.111
accept a period of really tight
close down and locked out. There is

1230
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:32.695
close down and locked out. There is
a really national obligation to

1231
00:37:32.695 --> 00:37:34.820
a really national obligation to
observe that. It is disheartening

1232
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.861
observe that. It is disheartening
when you hear the evening after the

1233
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.403
when you hear the evening after the
Prime Minister did what he did that

1234
00:37:39.403 --> 00:37:41.320
Prime Minister did what he did that
people were having barbecues in

1235
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.820
people were having barbecues in
their gardens and having 30 or A0

1236
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:43.986
their gardens and having 30 or 40
peopla

peopla around for a laugh and
thinking it

1239
00:37:45.653 --> 00:37:47.445
people around for a laugh and
thinking it was fun. This is not

1240
00:37:47.445 --> 00:37:50.236
thinking it was fun. This is not
fun. I have got an 85—year—old

1241
00:37:50.236 --> 00:37:50.653
fun. I have got an 85-year-old
father, a

1242
00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:52.861
fun. I have got an 85—year—old
father, a wonderful guy, in a house

father, a wonderful guy, in a house

want another five years from him at

00:37:56.986 --> 00:38:03.903
want another five years from him at
least. He is thinking, only five?! I

1248
00:38:03.903 --> 00:38:06.111
least. He is thinking, only five?! I
think all of us have to remember

00:38:06.111 --> 00:38:08.361
think all of us have to remember
this is not about something

this is not about something
nebulous, we have all got

nebulous, we have all got

dissociated threat that we face,

1256
00:38:19.611 --> 00:38:22.070
dissociated threat that we face,
this is personal and there is a real

this is personal and there is a real
obligation for that. Keep the

watching. Why are construction
workers are still putting themselves

1273
00:38:47.778 --> 00:38:50.403
workers are still putting themselves
at risk on nonessential construction

1274
00:38:50.403 --> 00:38:51.236
at risk on nonessential constmction
sites? My

1275

at risk on nonessential construction
sites? My husband is working on an

1276
00:38:52.528 --> 00:38:55.070
sites? My husband is working on an
NHS to site, which I am sure at this

1277
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.528
NHS to site, which I am sure at this
moment in time is not essential. I

1278
00:38:57.528 --> 00:39:00.236
moment in time is not essential. I
have seen many posts that show

1279
00:39:00.236 --> 00:39:04.570
have seen many posts that show
construction sites rammed with

1280
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:05.403
constmction sites rammed with
peopla and

dispensers.

1283
00:39:07.153 --> 00:39:08.778
people and no sanitisers or soap

1284
00:39:08.778 --> 00:39:10.445
dispensers. why is the government
not shutting

1285
00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:11.153
dispensers. Why is the government
not shutting down all nonessential

1286
00:39:11.153 --> 00:39:13.236
not shutting down all nonessential
construction sites? At the bottom of

1287
00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:13.611
constmction sites? At the bottom of
my road

1288
00:39:13.611 --> 00:39:15.070
construction sites? At the bottom of
my road people are having a house

1289
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:15.695
my road peopla are having a house
built and I

1290
00:39:15.695 --> 00:39:16.528
my road people are having a house
built and I spoke to the building

1291
00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:18.778
built and I spoke to the building
foreman and he said it was

1292
00:39:18.778 --> 00:39:20.320
foreman and he said it was
impossible for them to remain

1293
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.445
impossible for them to remain
socially distant, but they had to

1294
00:39:21.445 --> 00:39:23.695
socially distant, but they had to
come to work. We have to shut it

1295
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:26.653
come to work. We have to shut it
down. I completely agree with what

1296
00:39:26.653 --> 00:39:28.028
down. I completely agree with what
Humphrey is saying and the spirit of

1297
00:39:28.028 --> 00:39:31.611
Humphrey is saying and the spirit of
the question. The story from China

1298
00:39:31.611 --> 00:39:33.028
the question. The story from China
is very instructive and this is what

1299
00:39:33.028 --> 00:39:36.736
is very instructive and this is what
we have to prepare the public for.

1300
00:39:36.736 --> 00:39:38.486
we have to prepare the public for.
Wuhan, a city of 11 million people

were shutdown onJanuary the 23rd.

The best

1306
00:39:42.236 --> 00:39:43.153
were shut down onJanuary the 23rd.
The best estimates now are that

1307
00:39:43.153 --> 00:39:44.445
The best estimates now are that
those restrictions are only going to

1308
00:39:44.445 --> 00:39:48.236
those restrictions are only going to
be able to be lifted in early April.

1309
00:39:48.236 --> 00:39:52.195
be able to be lifted in early April.
That is roughly 11—12 weeks of a

1310
00:39:52.195 --> 00:39:52.653
That is roughly 11-12 weeks of a
city being

That is roughly 11—12 weeks of a

1316
00:39:57.028 --> 00:39:58.861
way only China knows how to shut

1317
00:39:58.861 --> 00:39:59.236
way only China knows how to shut
down a city. We have shutdown, and

1318
00:39:59.236 --> 00:40:01.945
down a city. We have shut down, and
I agree the

1319
00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:02.695
down a city. We have shutdown, and
I agree the government has taken

1320
00:40:02.695 --> 00:40:06.236
I agree the government has taken
vital steps in this lockdown, but we

1321
00:40:06.236 --> 00:40:08.236
vital steps in this lockdown, but we
have to really, really shut it down.

1322
00:40:08.236 --> 00:40:11.653
have to really, really shut it down.
You have got to shut it down as

1323
00:40:11.653 --> 00:40:13.361
You have got to shut it down as
close to 100% as possible. Even

1324
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:13.778
dose to10096 as possible. Even
then, I

1325
00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:16.320
close to 100% as possible. Even
then, I know we are not China, even

1326
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.778
then, I know we are not China, even
then we have to prepare the public

1327
00:40:18.778 --> 00:40:20.153
then we have to prepare the public
for 11-12

1328
00:40:20.153 --> 00:40:21.445
then we have to prepare the public
for 11—12 weeks of this before we

1329
00:40:21.445 --> 00:40:22.403
for 11-12 weeks of this before we
ran start

1330
00:40:22.403 --> 00:40:23.736
for 11—12 weeks of this before we
can start even thinking about

1331
00:40:23.736 --> 00:40:23.820
ran start even thinking about
lifting

1332
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.278
can start even thinking about
lifting restrictions. If we don’t

1333
00:40:25.278 --> 00:40:27.820
lifting restrictions. If we don’t
shut it down, it will be longer than

1334
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.278
shut it down, it will be longer than
that. That is why it is so critical

1335
00:40:30.278 --> 00:40:35.111
that. That is why it is so critical
that the public understand the

1336
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:36.236
that the public understand the
seriousness of the responsibility

1337
00:40:36.236 --> 00:40:40.361
seriousness of the responsibility
that everyone us holds. Robert, when

1338
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:43.653
that everyone us holds. Robert, when
it comes to construction sites, for

1339
00:40:43.653 --> 00:40:44.736
it comes to constmction sites, for
example, with

1340
00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:45.570
it comes to construction sites, for
example, with people crammed onto

1341
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:45.778
example, with people crammed onto
pub“:

1342
00:40:45.778 --> 00:40:48.778
example, with people crammed onto
public transport, why are you not

1343
00:40:48.778 --> 00:40:49.820
public transport, why are you not
shutting nonessential construction

1344
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:49.903
shutting nonessential constmction
sites

1345
00:40:49.903 --> 00:40:52.611
shutting nonessential construction
sites down? You could just do it.

1346
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:54.778
sites down? You could just do it.
Let me come to that in a moment,

1347
00:40:54.778 --> 00:40:57.278
Let me come to that in a moment,
rather than singling out one

1348
00:40:57.278 --> 00:40:58.861
rather than singling out one
occupation. The advice we received

1349
00:40:58.861 --> 00:41:01.653
occupation. The advice we received
from the scientists and the medics,

1350
00:41:01.653 --> 00:41:01.820
from the scientists and the media,
and

1351
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.903
from the scientists and the medics,
and world—class experts advising us,

1352
00:41:02.903 --> 00:41:03.653
and world-class experts advising us,
is that

1353
00:41:03.653 --> 00:41:05.736
and world—class experts advising us,
is that now is the right time in the

1354
00:41:05.736 --> 00:41:08.153
is that now is the right time in the
passage of the virus to take much

1355
00:41:08.153 --> 00:41:10.778
passage of the virus to take much
more significant steps. That is what

1356
00:41:10.778 --> 00:41:11.695
more significant steps. That is what
the Prime Minister announced on

1357
00:41:11.695 --> 00:41:13.986
the Prime Minister announced on
Monday. In general, there has been a

1358
00:41:13.986 --> 00:41:16.445
Monday. In general, there has been a
great degree of compliance with

1359
00:41:16.445 --> 00:41:18.236
great degree of compliance with
that. Most people understand there

1360
00:41:18.236 --> 00:41:20.445
that. Most people understand there
is a moral obligation on all of us

1361
00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:22.320
is a moral obligation on all of us
to protect others, even if you are

1362
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.153
to protect others, even if you are
not concerned about your own health.

1363
00:41:26.153 --> 00:41:27.236
not concerned about your own health.
Retailers and business owners,

Retailers and business owners,
including owners of

1365
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.445
Retailers and business owners,
including owners ofJames, have had

1366
00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:30.695
including owners of james, have had
to bear a huge

1367
00:41:30.695 --> 00:41:31.653
including owners ofJames, have had
to bear a huge burden from that, and

1368
00:41:31.653 --> 00:41:32.695
to hear a huge burden from that, and
the people

1369
00:41:32.695 --> 00:41:33.778
to bear a huge burden from that, and
the people working in them, and the

1370
00:41:33.778 --> 00:41:35.695
the people working in them, and the
vast majority of people have

1371
00:41:35.695 --> 00:41:36.695
vast majority of peopla have
complied

1372
00:41:36.695 --> 00:41:38.986
vast majority of people have
complied across the country. We are

1373
00:41:38.986 --> 00:41:40.736
complied across the country. We are
grateful for those employers and

1374
00:41:40.736 --> 00:41:42.736
grateful for those employers and
employees for taking that burden on.

1375
00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:44.861
employees for taking that burden on.
The advice we receive, however, is

1376
00:41:44.861 --> 00:41:47.903
The advice we receive, however, is
if you are not in those nonessential

1377
00:41:47.903 --> 00:41:48.736
if you are not in those nonessential
retail jobs, you

1378
00:41:48.736 --> 00:41:49.653
if you are not in those nonessential
retailjobs, you can still go to

1379
00:41:49.653 --> 00:41:50.570
retail jobs, you ran still go to
work.

1380
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.153
retailjobs, you can still go to
work. You need to work from home if

1381
00:41:53.153 --> 00:41:56.445
work. You need to work from home if
it is at all possible. That is

1382
00:41:56.445 --> 00:41:57.403
it is at all possible. That is
really important. Everybody should

1383
00:41:57.403 --> 00:41:59.820
really important. Everybody should
find any way possible to do that, so

1384
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.528
find any way possibla to do that, so
you minimise

1385
00:42:00.528 --> 00:42:02.695
find any way possible to do that, so
you minimise the amount of social

1386
00:42:02.695 --> 00:42:04.445
you minimise the amount of social
contact you have, but if it is

1387
00:42:04.445 --> 00:42:06.903
contact you have, but if it is
impossible to work from home, then

1388
00:42:06.903 --> 00:42:09.236
impossible to work from home, then
the medical advice was you can still

1389
00:42:09.236 --> 00:42:09.486
the medical advice was you ran still
do

1390
00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:09.695
the mediral advice was you ran still
do that.

1391
00:42:09.695 --> 00:42:11.653
the medical advice was you can still
do that. You need to go directly to

1392
00:42:11.653 --> 00:42:13.486
do that. You need to go directly to
work, you need to be considerate

1393
00:42:13.486 --> 00:42:16.070
work, you need to be considerate
about public transport, and that

1394
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.653
about public transport, and that
might mean things like varying the

1395
00:42:17.653 --> 00:42:20.403
might mean things like varying the
times you go to work so everyone is

1396
00:42:20.403 --> 00:42:21.736
times you go to work so everyone is
not crowded on public transport and

1397
00:42:21.736 --> 00:42:25.236
not crowded on public transport and
the tube at the same time, that is a

1398
00:42:25.236 --> 00:42:26.820
the tube at the same time, that is a
concern at the moment. And when you

1399
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.611
concern at the moment. And when you
are in the workplace your employer

1400
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:31.320
are in the workplace your employer
needs to make sure you follow the

1401
00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:31.528
needs to make sure you follow the
Pub“:

1402
00:42:31.528 --> 00:42:32.903
needs to make sure you follow the
Public Health England guidelines. If

1403
00:42:32.903 --> 00:42:35.111
Public Health England guidelines. If
you can’t do that, it is difficult

1404
00:42:35.111 --> 00:42:37.195
you can’t do that, it is difficult
to see how those businesses can

1405
00:42:37.195 --> 00:42:39.195
to see how those businesses ran
remain open.

1406
00:42:39.195 --> 00:42:41.695
to see how those businesses can
remain open. But in the main, they

1407
00:42:41.695 --> 00:42:42.653
remain open. But in the main, they
ran do. To

1408
00:42:42.653 --> 00:42:44.778
remain open. But in the main, they
can do. To take the example of

1409
00:42:44.778 --> 00:42:45.570
can do. To take the example of
construction, Public Health England

1410
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:45.695
constmction, Public Health England
have

1411
00:42:45.695 --> 00:42:47.778
construction, Public Health England
have worked with the construction

1412
00:42:47.778 --> 00:42:47.861
have worked with the constmction
leadership

1413
00:42:47.861 --> 00:42:49.570
have worked with the construction
leadership Council, one of the

1414
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:50.778
leadership Council, one of the
industry bodies, to produce guidance

1415
00:42:50.778 --> 00:42:52.945
industry bodies, to produce guidance
to the types of setting, and it will

1416
00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:55.236
to the types of setting, and it will
not be all parts of the industry,

1417
00:42:55.236 --> 00:42:56.653
not be all parts of the industry,
but the types of setting where it

1418
00:42:56.653 --> 00:42:59.403
but the types of setting where it
would be safe to operate if you take

1419
00:42:59.403 --> 00:43:01.486
would be safe to operate if you take
certain measures that the experts

1420
00:43:01.486 --> 00:43:04.278
certain measures that the experts
have advised. I think that is a

1421
00:43:04.278 --> 00:43:05.611
have advised. I think that is a
sensible way forward. Are you

1422
00:43:05.611 --> 00:43:07.653
sensible way forward. Are you
satisfied that is happening? There

1423
00:43:07.653 --> 00:43:10.320
satisfied that is happening? There
are so many examples coming in. I

1424
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.820
are so many examples coming in. I
gave you one myself. I have seen

1425
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.028
gave you one myself. I have seen
some examples where it is concerning

1426
00:43:17.028 --> 00:43:19.028
some examples where it is concerning
and those employers now need to take

1427
00:43:19.028 --> 00:43:21.278
and those employers now need to take
action. There are also lots of

1428
00:43:21.278 --> 00:43:23.778
action. There are also lots of
examples where it is sensible. We

1429
00:43:23.778 --> 00:43:25.695
examples where it is sensible. We
all have to appreciate these are

1430
00:43:25.695 --> 00:43:28.111
all have to appreciate these are
difficult decisions and when you are

1431
00:43:28.111 --> 00:43:29.653
difficult decisions and when you are
considering looking down, as the

1432
00:43:29.653 --> 00:43:32.111
considering looking down, as the
term is, there is a balance to be

1433
00:43:32.111 --> 00:43:35.111
term is, there is a balance to be
struck. If you go too far, then it

1434
00:43:35.111 --> 00:43:36.403
struck. If you go too far, then it
is not sustainable and you cannot

1435
00:43:36.403 --> 00:43:38.028
is not sustainable and you rannot
keep society

1436
00:43:38.028 --> 00:43:40.236
is not sustainable and you cannot
keep society with you for 11 or 12

1437
00:43:40.236 --> 00:43:43.070
keep society with you for 11 or 12
weeks. You also need some parts of

1438
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.653
weeks. You also need some parts of
the economy, frankly, to be able to

1439
00:43:45.653 --> 00:43:47.445
the economy, frankly, to be able to
continue to operate, because we need

1440
00:43:47.445 --> 00:43:49.695
continue to operate, because we need
people to be in work as far as they

1441
00:43:49.695 --> 00:43:50.820
peopla to be in work as far as they
ran be, we

1442
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.195
people to be in work as far as they
can be, we need to produce things,

1443
00:43:52.195 --> 00:43:52.695
ran be, we need to produce things,
we do

1444
00:43:52.695 --> 00:43:55.153
can be, we need to produce things,
we do need to maintain the roads and

1445
00:43:55.153 --> 00:43:57.153
we do need to maintain the roads and
the railways. In the construction

1446
00:43:57.153 --> 00:43:57.653
the railways. In the constmction
industry we

1447
00:43:57.653 --> 00:43:58.736
the railways. In the construction
industry we certainly need buildings

1448
00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:01.570
industry we certainly need buildings
to be well so they are safe and

1449
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.986
to be well so they are safe and
hygienic. We need to ensure really

1450
00:44:03.986 --> 00:44:05.486
hygienic. We need to ensure really
important programmes continue, like

1451
00:44:05.486 --> 00:44:07.903
important programmes continue, like
the removal of dangerous cladding

1452
00:44:07.903 --> 00:44:09.445
the removal of dangerous cladding
from buildings, the programme that

1453
00:44:09.445 --> 00:44:11.611
from buildings, the programme that
we launched after the Grenfell fire.

1454
00:44:11.611 --> 00:44:12.028
we hunched after the Grenfell fire.
There are

1455
00:44:12.028 --> 00:44:13.278
we launched after the Grenfell fire.
There are a lot of settings where it

1456
00:44:13.278 --> 00:44:16.570
There are a lot of settings where it
is in the public interest that work

1457
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.028
is in the public interest that work
continues. We in government have to

1458
00:44:18.028 --> 00:44:20.528
continues. We in government have to
strike a sensible balance to keep as

1459
00:44:20.528 --> 00:44:23.028
strike a sensible balance to keep as
many people in work, and as much of

1460
00:44:23.028 --> 00:44:24.528
many peopla in work, and as much of
the economy

1461
00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:25.653
many people in work, and as much of
the economy functioning as possible,

1462
00:44:25.653 --> 00:44:27.236
the economy functioning as possible,
whilst protecting public health.

1463
00:44:27.236 --> 00:44:29.070
whilst protecting public health.
Every time we take those steps, I

1464
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:29.320
Every time we take those steps, I
ran

1465
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:29.570
Every time we take those steps, I
can assure

1466
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.111
Every time we take those steps, I
ran assure you

1467
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:31.945
Every time we take those steps, I
can assure you that we are doing it

1468
00:44:31.945 --> 00:44:32.278
ran assure you that we are doing it
carefully and

1469
00:44:32.278 --> 00:44:33.736
can assure you that we are doing it
carefully and on the best advice

1470
00:44:33.736 --> 00:44:37.528
carefully and on the best advice
from the medics and the scientists.

1471
00:44:37.528 --> 00:44:39.028
from the media and the scientists.
I hear you and I

1472
00:44:39.028 --> 00:44:39.320
from the medics and the scientists.
I hear you and I am

1473
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.611
from the medics and the scientists.
I hearyou and I am not

1474
00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:40.736
from the medics and the scientists.
I hear you and I am not pretending

1475
00:44:40.736 --> 00:44:42.736
I hear you and I am not pretending
that this is in any way an easy

1476
00:44:42.736 --> 00:44:44.945
that this is in any way an easy
thing because I get the sense from

1477
00:44:44.945 --> 00:44:47.111
thing because I get the sense from
the government that there is

1478
00:44:47.111 --> 00:44:48.986
the government that there is
attention between those who are very

1479
00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:52.361
attention between those who are very
keen on keeping the economy going,

1480
00:44:52.361 --> 00:44:54.528
keen on keeping the economy going,
and one completely understands that,

1481
00:44:54.528 --> 00:44:57.236
and one completely understands that,
and those that are primarily keen on

1482
00:44:57.236 --> 00:44:58.736
and those that are primarily keen on
protecting public health. I have to

1483
00:44:58.736 --> 00:44:58.903
protecting public health. I have to
55V

1484
00:44:58.903 --> 00:45:01.653
protecting public health. I have to
say that I think the protection of

1485
00:45:01.653 --> 00:45:02.111
say that I think the protection of
life tmmps

1486
00:45:02.111 --> 00:45:04.320
say that I think the protection of
life trumps everything and ought to

1487
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:04.570
life tmmps everything and ought to
tmmp

1488
00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.528
life trumps everything and ought to
trump everything. And so was, of

1489
00:45:06.528 --> 00:45:07.695
tmmp everything. And so was, of
course, ideally

1490
00:45:07.695 --> 00:45:09.611
trump everything. And so was, of
course, ideally we want to keep our

1491
00:45:09.611 --> 00:45:10.320
course, ideally we want to keep our
economy going, we

1492
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:10.486
course, ideally we want to keep our
economy going, wejust

1493
00:45:10.486 --> 00:45:11.736
course, ideally we want to keep our
economy going, we just have to not

1494
00:45:11.736 --> 00:45:14.945
economy going, we just have to not
compromise when it comes to people

1495
00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:15.611
compromise when it comes to peopla
going to work

1496
00:45:15.611 --> 00:45:16.403
compromise when it comes to people
going to work on public transport in

1497
00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:18.778
going to work on public transport in
order to build a block of flats,

1498
00:45:18.778 --> 00:45:19.195
order to build a block of ﬂats,
which they

1499
00:45:19.195 --> 00:45:21.611
order to build a block of flats,
which they simply can’t put the

1500
00:45:21.611 --> 00:45:23.403
which they simply can’t put the
windows in was being two metres

1501
00:45:23.403 --> 00:45:25.903
windows in was being two metres
apart. You just cannot do the work.

1502
00:45:25.903 --> 00:45:28.945
apart. You just cannot do the work.
I don’t understand that it is done

1503
00:45:28.945 --> 00:45:30.528
I don’t understand that it is done
so publicly. I don’t understand why

1504
00:45:30.528 --> 00:45:32.778
so publicly. I don’t understand why
they are still allowed to do it and

1505
00:45:32.778 --> 00:45:34.653
they are still allowed to do it and
why the government does not make it

1506
00:45:34.653 --> 00:45:36.486
why the government does not make it
clear that this is not on, they are

1507
00:45:36.486 --> 00:45:39.570
clear that this is not on, they are
not to work in that way, this is not

1508
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.028
not to work in that way, this is not
essential work.

1509
00:45:40.028 --> 00:45:40.195
not to work in that way, this is not
essentialwork. I

1510
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:41.861
not to work in that way, this is not
essential work. I hear what you say

1511
00:45:41.861 --> 00:45:43.861
essential work. I hear what you say
about there being sometimes when you

1512
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:46.028
about there being sometimes when you
need to have builders, of course you

1513
00:45:46.028 --> 00:45:47.945
need to have builders, of course you
do. You cannot have an elderly

1514
00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:48.611
do. You cannot have an elderty
person whose

1515
00:45:48.611 --> 00:45:49.320
do. You cannot have an elderly
person whose heater stops working.

1516
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.153
person whose heater stops working.
They need to have hot water. Those

1517
00:45:53.153 --> 00:45:55.695
They need to have hot water. Those
circumstances are one thing, but

1518
00:45:55.695 --> 00:45:56.445
circumstances are one thing, but
building and the construction

1519
00:45:56.445 --> 00:45:58.361
building and the construction
workers at the moment does not make

1520
00:45:58.361 --> 00:46:00.528
workers at the moment does not make
any sense. The problem is, I think

1521
00:46:00.528 --> 00:46:02.986
any sense. The problem is, I think
the vast majority of British people

1522
00:46:02.986 --> 00:46:03.361
the vast majority of British peopla
want to

1523
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:06.195
the vast majority of British people
want to do the right thing, faced

1524
00:46:06.195 --> 00:46:07.653
want to do the right thing, faced
with this terrible crisis. But what

1525
00:46:07.653 --> 00:46:09.778
with this terrible crisis. But what
they need is clear leadership and

1526
00:46:09.778 --> 00:46:11.986
they need is clear leadership and
they need as part of that

1527
00:46:11.986 --> 00:46:13.361
they need as part of that
leadership, first of all, this is

1528
00:46:13.361 --> 00:46:15.986
leadership, first of all, this is
what we expect you to do, but they

1529
00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:17.528
what we expect you to do, but they
also need as part of that

1530
00:46:17.528 --> 00:46:19.653
also need as part of that
leadership, and this is what we will

1531
00:46:19.653 --> 00:46:21.695
leadership, and this is what we will
do for you in return, so we will

1532
00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:23.361
do for you in return, so we will
make sure that you have an income,

1533
00:46:23.361 --> 00:46:26.028
make sure that you have an income,
no matter who you are. That there

1534
00:46:26.028 --> 00:46:28.361
no matter who you are. That there
will be food available for you, when

1535
00:46:28.361 --> 00:46:30.528
will be food available for you, when
you go to the shops there will be a

1536
00:46:30.528 --> 00:46:32.070
you go to the shops there will be a
proper supply of food and you will

1537
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:36.778
proper supply of food and you will
not lose your home. And obviously we

1538
00:46:36.778 --> 00:46:38.153
not lose your home. And obviously we
are doing everything we can to make

1539
00:46:38.153 --> 00:46:38.486
are doing everything we ran to make
sure the

1540
00:46:38.486 --> 00:46:40.778
are doing everything we can to make
sure the NHS can stand up to this

1541
00:46:40.778 --> 00:46:40.945
sure the NHS ran stand up to this
terrible

1542
00:46:40.945 --> 00:46:42.111
sure the NHS can stand up to this
terrible burden which has been

1543
00:46:42.111 --> 00:46:44.111
terrible burden which has been
thrown at it. If we had that

1544
00:46:44.111 --> 00:46:45.528
thrown at it. If we had that
partnership, then I think we can get

1545
00:46:45.528 --> 00:46:47.361
partnership, then I think we ran get
through this. In

1546
00:46:47.361 --> 00:46:48.403
partnership, then I think we can get
through this. In many ways the

1547
00:46:48.403 --> 00:46:50.153
through this. In many ways the
government is doing the right thing,

1548
00:46:50.153 --> 00:46:51.778
government is doing the right thing,
but there are some glaring things

1549
00:46:51.778 --> 00:46:53.611
but there are some glaring things
that you are missing and I think you

1550
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:58.236
that you are missing and I think you
should get on with that.

1551
00:46:58.236 --> 00:46:58.945
To a nswer

1552
00:46:58.945 --> 00:47:02.153
To answer that point, we are doing
the things you have set out. The

1553
00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:04.278
the things you have set out. The
package of measures we have now put

1554
00:47:04.278 --> 00:47:06.278
package of measures we have now put
out for the economy to support

1555
00:47:06.278 --> 00:47:07.861
out for the economy to support
individuals and families, there is

1556
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:11.153
individuals and families, there is
no precedent in our history.

1557
00:47:11.153 --> 00:47:12.528
no precedent in our history.
Absolutely, and I acknowledge that.

1558
00:47:12.528 --> 00:47:14.195
Absolutely, and I acknowledge that.
Compared to other countries who are

1559
00:47:14.195 --> 00:47:16.361
Compared to other countries who are
battling with the same problem, it

1560
00:47:16.361 --> 00:47:17.611
battling with the same problam, it
compares

1561
00:47:17.611 --> 00:47:19.236
battling with the same problem, it
compares favourably and is among the

1562
00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:20.945
compares favourably and is among the
most comprehensive package of

1563
00:47:20.945 --> 00:47:22.528
most comprehensive package of
support among developed countries in

1564
00:47:22.528 --> 00:47:24.653
support among developed countries in
the world. Looking at the

1565
00:47:24.653 --> 00:47:25.861
the world. Looking at the
initiatives, in my department in

1566
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:27.778
initiatives, in my department in
seven days we have put together a

1567
00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:31.195
seven days we have put together a
programme to try to deliver food

1568
00:47:31.195 --> 00:47:32.653
programme to try to deliver food
parcels to those of the 1.5 million

1569
00:47:32.653 --> 00:47:35.195
parcels to those of the 1.5 million
people who we are shielding, those

1570
00:47:35.195 --> 00:47:39.361
people who we are shielding, those
people who need to be at home for

1571
00:47:39.361 --> 00:47:40.861
people who need to be at home for
specific medical reasons, who can’t

1572
00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:43.361
specific medical reasons, who can’t
have face—to—face contact other than

1573
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:43.736
have face-to-face contact other than
with their

1574
00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:44.778
have face—to—face contact other than
with their partners or members of

1575
00:47:44.778 --> 00:47:46.778
with their partners or members of
their household, for the next 12

1576
00:47:46.778 --> 00:47:47.820
their household, for the next 12
weeks. For

1577
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:47.945
their household, for the next 12
weeks. Forthose

1578
00:47:47.945 --> 00:47:48.153
their household, for the next 12
weeks. For those people,

1579
00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:48.361
their household, for the next 12
weeks. Forthose people, I

1580
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:49.611
their household, for the next 12
weeks. For those people, I hope on

1581
00:47:49.611 --> 00:47:50.736
weeks. For those people, I hope on
Saturday the first food parcels of

1582
00:47:50.736 --> 00:47:52.278
Saturday the first food parcels of
land on their doorsteps. Huge

1583
00:47:52.278 --> 00:47:54.695
land on their doorsteps. Huge
efforts are happening. I’m not

1584
00:47:54.695 --> 00:47:56.445
efforts are happening. I’m not
saying this to seek praise for me, I

1585
00:47:56.445 --> 00:47:58.778
saying this to seek praise for me, I
am saying it for the thousands of

1586
00:47:58.778 --> 00:47:59.278
am saying it for the thousands of
peopla

1587
00:47:59.278 --> 00:47:59.945
am saying it for the thousands of
people across government, from town

1588
00:47:59.945 --> 00:48:00.445
peopla across government, from town
halls to

1589
00:48:00.445 --> 00:48:03.111
people across government, from town
halls to Whitehall. But that is such

1590
00:48:03.111 --> 00:48:05.153
halls to Whitehall. But that is such
a good example of where the problem

1591
00:48:05.153 --> 00:48:09.528
a good example of where the problem
is. It is wonderful, we have all

1592
00:48:09.528 --> 00:48:11.028
is. It is wonderful, we have all
these volunteers. 400,000 people

1593
00:48:11.028 --> 00:48:15.361
these volunteers. 400,000 people
coming forward to volunteer support.

1594
00:48:15.361 --> 00:48:17.695
coming forward to volunteer support.
500,000. It’s brilliant, probably

1595
00:48:17.695 --> 00:48:19.570
500,000. It’s brilliant, probably
700,000 by the end of the night.

1596
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.195
700,000 by the end of the night.
People want to do the right thing

1597
00:48:21.195 --> 00:48:23.778
People want to do the right thing
and support one another. It’s great

1598
00:48:23.778 --> 00:48:24.903
and support one another. It’s great
the government is organising food

1599
00:48:24.903 --> 00:48:27.278
the government is organising food
parcels and that is brilliant, but

1600
00:48:27.278 --> 00:48:29.153
parcels and that is brilliant, but
they will arrive without masks and

1601
00:48:29.153 --> 00:48:30.528
they will arrive without masks and
without gloves because that bit has

1602
00:48:30.528 --> 00:48:34.070
without gloves because that bit has
fallen down. You don’t need a mask

1603
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:37.028
fallen down. You don’t need a mask
to deliver a food parcel to

1604
00:48:37.028 --> 00:48:38.570
to deliver a food parcel to
someone’s door. But the carer going

1605
00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:38.986
someone’s door. But the rarer going
in will

1606
00:48:38.986 --> 00:48:43.028
someone’s door. But the carer going
in will need them. All I’m saying is

1607
00:48:43.028 --> 00:48:44.445
in will need them. All I’m saying is
that the government has done a great

1608
00:48:44.445 --> 00:48:46.070
that the government has done a great
deal but it needs to go further and

1609
00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:49.820
deal but it needs to go further and
these things need to be said. You

1610
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.236
these things need to be said. You
were talking about the balancing act

1611
00:48:51.236 --> 00:48:53.361
were talking about the balancing act
between the economy and public

1612
00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:57.195
between the economy and public
health. As you know and as the

1613
00:48:57.195 --> 00:48:58.570
health. As you know and as the
labour Party

1614
00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:59.611
health. As you know and as the
Labour Party has said many times,

1615
00:48:59.611 --> 00:49:00.111
labour Party has said many times,
austerity costs

1616
00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:04.820
Labour Party has said many times,
austerity costs lives. You are

1617
00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.736
austerity costs lives. You are
saying public health trumps that

1618
00:49:05.736 --> 00:49:06.528
saying public health tmmps that
every time

1619
00:49:06.528 --> 00:49:07.611
saying public health trumps that
every time but nonetheless, there is

1620
00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.653
every time but nonetheless, there is
a balance here somewhere and won the

1621
00:49:09.653 --> 00:49:10.278
a balance here somewhere and won the
labour Party has

1622
00:49:10.278 --> 00:49:11.028
a balance here somewhere and won the
Labour Party has talked about many

1623
00:49:11.028 --> 00:49:11.653
labour Party has talked about many
times in

1624
00:49:11.653 --> 00:49:12.778
Labour Party has talked about many
times in terms of the cost of

1625
00:49:12.778 --> 00:49:14.403
times in terms of the cost of
austerity. You must be worried about

1626
00:49:14.403 --> 00:49:16.778
austerity. You must be worried about
that. Getting construction workers

1627
00:49:16.778 --> 00:49:17.153
that. Getting constmction workers
of the

1628
00:49:17.153 --> 00:49:18.403
that. Getting construction workers
of the site or whoever it might be,

1629
00:49:18.403 --> 00:49:20.861
of the site or whoever it might be,
but the bill has to be paid by

1630
00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:22.403
but the bill has to be paid by
somebody. I agree and I

1631
00:49:22.403 --> 00:49:22.611
but the bill has to be paid by
somebody. I agree and Ifully

1632
00:49:22.611 --> 00:49:24.361
somebody. I agree and Ifully
understand this is a crisis, but

1633
00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:26.070
understand this is a crisis, but
when you have a crisis I am afraid

1634
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.403
when you have a crisis I am afraid
you have to do the right thing. If

1635
00:49:29.403 --> 00:49:30.695
you have to do the right thing. If
we are talking about austerity than

1636
00:49:30.695 --> 00:49:32.986
we are talking about austerity than
I think it would also be right to

1637
00:49:32.986 --> 00:49:33.403
I think it would also be right to
55V

1638
00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:35.236
I think it would also be right to
say that we would have been in a

1639
00:49:35.236 --> 00:49:37.986
say that we would have been in a
much better position if before this

1640
00:49:37.986 --> 00:49:39.736
much better position if before this
crisis the beds in the hospitals

1641
00:49:39.736 --> 00:49:45.778
crisis the beds in the hospitals
were not at 95% capacity, if we

1642
00:49:45.778 --> 00:49:45.945
were not at 9596 capacity, if we
didn’t

1643
00:49:45.945 --> 00:49:46.986
were not at 95% capacity, if we
didn’t have 100,000 vacancies in the

1644
00:49:46.986 --> 00:49:48.986
didn’t have 100,000 vacancies in the
National Health Service, and if we

1645
00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:51.445
National Health Service, and if we
had as a result of austerity stops

1646
00:49:51.445 --> 00:49:54.861
had as a result of austerity stops
the money we paid for nurses to get

1647
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:57.111
the money we paid for nurses to get
trained. The stripping out of public

1648
00:49:57.111 --> 00:50:00.153
trained. The stripping out of public
services in many ways are being

1649
00:50:00.153 --> 00:50:01.945
services in many ways are being
exposed by this crisis and it is

1650
00:50:01.945 --> 00:50:03.028
exposed by this crisis and it is
very unfortunate that the country

1651
00:50:03.028 --> 00:50:07.361
very unfortunate that the country
has gone through what it has. For

1652
00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:07.945
has gone through what it has. For
example, people proclaiming

1653
00:50:07.945 --> 00:50:09.778
example, people proclaiming
Universal Credit for the first time

1654
00:50:09.778 --> 00:50:11.361
Universal Credit for the first time
not realising what it is sent to the

1655
00:50:11.361 --> 00:50:12.611
not realising what it is sent to the
changes that have been made to

1656
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:14.153
changes that have been made to
benefits and how hard life really is

1657
00:50:14.153 --> 00:50:15.528
benefits and how hard life really is
for those who have been living on

1658
00:50:15.528 --> 00:50:19.653
for those who have been living on
benefits up to now. We want to get

1659
00:50:19.653 --> 00:50:23.445
benefits up to now. We want to get
one member of the public in... Our

1660
00:50:23.445 --> 00:50:24.611
one member of the public in... Our
policy is about saving lives. There

1661
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:27.403
policy is about saving lives. There
is no balancing act with the

1662
00:50:27.403 --> 00:50:29.195
is no balancing act with the
economy. We are focused on saving

1663
00:50:29.195 --> 00:50:30.986
economy. We are focused on saving
lives. But there is a direct

1664
00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:31.736
lives. But there is a direct
correlation between the public

1665
00:50:31.736 --> 00:50:33.778
correlation between the public
health outcome and some of these

1666
00:50:33.778 --> 00:50:35.028
health outcome and some of these
measures because if you want to

1667
00:50:35.028 --> 00:50:37.320
measures because if you want to
sustain a lockdown or very

1668
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.778
sustain a lockdown or very
restrictive measures on all our

1669
00:50:38.778 --> 00:50:41.820
restrictive measures on all our
lives for a long period of time,

1670
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.486
lives for a long period of time,
potentially 12 weeks, you have to

1671
00:50:43.486 --> 00:50:46.653
potentially 12 weeks, you have to
think very carefully about that. If

1672
00:50:46.653 --> 00:50:47.320
think very carefully about that. If
you completely close—down society,

1673
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.945
you completely dose-down society,
if you make it

1674
00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.445
you completely close—down society,
if you make it impossible for anyone

1675
00:50:50.445 --> 00:50:54.236
if you make it impossible for anyone
to work or make products or services

1676
00:50:54.236 --> 00:50:56.986
to work or make products or services
then you may find... I am not

1677
00:50:56.986 --> 00:50:57.611
then you may find... lam not
calling for that,

1678
00:50:57.611 --> 00:51:00.528
then you may find... I am not
calling for that, of course I’m not

1679
00:51:00.528 --> 00:51:00.903
falling for that, of course I’m not
calling for

1680
00:51:00.903 --> 00:51:01.486
calling for that, of course I’m not
calling for essential products and

1681
00:51:01.486 --> 00:51:04.653
calling for essential products and
services to stop. What I am saying

1682
00:51:04.653 --> 00:51:05.028
services to stop. what I am saying
is we

1683
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.320
services to stop. What I am saying
is we need clear leadership and if

1684
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:06.778
is we need dear leadership and if
there is

1685
00:51:06.778 --> 00:51:08.320
is we need clear leadership and if
there is clear leadership I believe

1686
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.695
there is clear leadership I believe
the British people will follow. I

1687
00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:10.986
the British peopla will follow. I
hope

1688
00:51:10.986 --> 00:51:12.611
the British people will follow. I
hope we have done that because our

1689
00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:13.945
hope we have done that because our
message to the British people

1690
00:51:13.945 --> 00:51:16.111
message to the British people
watching is very clear this evening.

1691
00:51:16.111 --> 00:51:18.570
watching is very clear this evening.
If you stay at home you will protect

1692
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.570
If you stay at home you will protect
the NHS and save lives. With respect

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:22.486
the NHS and save lives. with respect

00:51:22.486 --> 00:51:23.111
the NHS and save lives. With respect
to work, it is simply, work from

1695
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:23.986
to work, it is simply, work from
home if you ran

1696
00:51:23.986 --> 00:51:25.361
to work, it is simply, work from
home if you can and if that is

1697
00:51:25.361 --> 00:51:25.820
home if you ran and if that is
impossible,

1698
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.528
home if you can and if that is
impossible, go to work but only if

1699
00:51:27.528 --> 00:51:28.153
impossible, go to work but only if
you ran follow

1700
00:51:28.153 --> 00:51:29.445
impossible, go to work but only if
you can follow the guidelines from

you ran follow the guidelines from
Pub“:

1702
00:51:29.528 --> 00:51:30.903
you can follow the guidelines from
Public Health England and do so in a

1703
00:51:30.903 --> 00:51:34.611
Public Health England and do so in a
safe manner. On clear messaging,

1704
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:34.778
safe manner. On dear messaging,
Richard

1705
00:51:34.778 --> 00:51:36.111
safe manner. On clear messaging,
Richard was talking about a

1706
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:37.903
Richard was talking about a
lockdown, for want of a different

1707
00:51:37.903 --> 00:51:38.778
lockdown, for want of a different
phrase, of

1708
00:51:38.778 --> 00:51:39.070
lockdown, for want of a different
phrase, of“

1709
00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.070
lockdown, for want of a different
phrase, of 11 or 12 weeks. Is that

1710
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.195
phrase, of 11 or 12 weeks. Is that
what you’re saying tonight, that’s

1711
00:51:42.195 --> 00:51:44.445
what you’re saying tonight, that’s
how long it could be, in the

1712
00:51:44.445 --> 00:51:46.986
how long it could be, in the
government’s view? The measures we

1713
00:51:46.986 --> 00:51:48.361
government’s view? The measures we
have implemented, we said we will

1714
00:51:48.361 --> 00:51:50.153
have implemented, we said we will
review them at Easter and that is a

1715
00:51:50.153 --> 00:51:53.028
review them at Easter and that is a
sensible period of time to see how

1716
00:51:53.028 --> 00:51:54.486
sensible period of time to see how
they are working. Nobody is

1717
00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:56.778
they are working. Nobody is
pretending this will be over by

1718
00:51:56.778 --> 00:51:59.028
pretending this will be over by
Easter but we do think, and this is

1719
00:51:59.028 --> 00:52:00.820
Easter but we do think, and this is
backed up by medical opinion, if

1720
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.945
backed up by medical opinion, if
each and every one of us does what

1721
00:52:02.945 --> 00:52:05.153
each and every one of us does what
we are asked to do and we do the

1722
00:52:05.153 --> 00:52:06.820
we are asked to do and we do the
things we have described, staying at

1723
00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.611
things we have described, staying at
home whenever we can, if we either

1724
00:52:09.611 --> 00:52:10.486
home whenever we ran, if we either
don’t go to work,

1725
00:52:10.486 --> 00:52:12.236
home whenever we can, if we either
don’t go to work, or if we do so we

1726
00:52:12.236 --> 00:52:14.153
don’t go to work, or if we do so we
follow the guidance of Public Health

1727
00:52:14.153 --> 00:52:15.861
follow the guidance of Public Health
England, if we all do that then

1728
00:52:15.861 --> 00:52:17.153
England, if we all do that then
there is reason to believe that

1729
00:52:17.153 --> 00:52:19.361
there is reason to believe that
within that sort of period we could

1730
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:20.778
within that sort of period we could
see the beginnings of the turn of

1731
00:52:20.778 --> 00:52:24.361
see the beginnings of the turn of
the tide. But it is on all the fuss

1732
00:52:24.361 --> 00:52:26.695
the tide. But it is on all the fuss
to take those steps in our own

1733
00:52:26.695 --> 00:52:28.070
to take those steps in our own
lives, as well as all the amazing

1734
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:28.570
lives, as well as all the amazing
peopla in

1735
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:31.028
lives, as well as all the amazing
people in the NHS who will be

1736
00:52:31.028 --> 00:52:31.403
peopla in the NHS who will be
fighting to

1737
00:52:31.403 --> 00:52:32.445
people in the NHS who will be
fighting to save lives. I think we

1738
00:52:32.445 --> 00:52:34.653
fighting to save lives. I think we
need to prepare the public for this

1739
00:52:34.653 --> 00:52:37.361
need to prepare the public for this
period of 12 weeks. We really do. It

1740
00:52:37.361 --> 00:52:38.986
period of 12 weeks. We really do. It
is a really tough challenge but the

1741
00:52:38.986 --> 00:52:40.320
is a really tough challenge but the
reason why we should prepare them

1742
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.903
reason why we should prepare them
for that period is that if we don’t

1743
00:52:43.903 --> 00:52:47.111
for that period is that if we don’t
suppress it in that 12 weeks it will

1744
00:52:47.111 --> 00:52:49.153
suppress it in that 12 weeks it will
go on even longer. That’s why we

1745
00:52:49.153 --> 00:52:50.903
go on even longer. That’s why we
have to be tough new in order to get

1746
00:52:50.903 --> 00:52:53.570
have to be tough now in order to get
through this and

1747
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.153
have to be tough new in order to get
through this and have the

1748
00:52:54.153 --> 00:52:55.028
have to be tough now in order to get
through this and have the economy

1749
00:52:55.028 --> 00:52:55.361
through this and have the economy
return, I

1750
00:52:55.361 --> 00:52:56.236
through this and have the economy
return, Ifully agree, returned to

1751
00:52:56.236 --> 00:52:59.403
return, Ifully agree, returned to
some semblance of order. I think

1752
00:52:59.403 --> 00:53:01.986
some semblance of order. I think
that’s right. We have to level with

1753
00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:03.778
that’s right. We have to level with
people about how tough this will be

1754
00:53:03.778 --> 00:53:03.861
peopla about how tough this will be
for

1755
00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:06.070
people about how tough this will be
for some in society. That is why the

1756
00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:09.611
for some in society. That is why the
NHS has written for example to 1.5

1757
00:53:09.611 --> 00:53:10.695
NHS has written for example to 1.5
million people, and those letters

1758
00:53:10.695 --> 00:53:12.778
million people, and those letters
will have been dropping on doormats

1759
00:53:12.778 --> 00:53:15.236
will have been dropping on doormats
over the course of this week. That

1760
00:53:15.236 --> 00:53:17.111
over the course of this week. That
is saying to those people who have

1761
00:53:17.111 --> 00:53:17.361
is saying to those peopla who have
specific

1762
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:18.570
is saying to those people who have
specific clinical reasons that put

1763
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.236
specific clinical reasons that put
them at high risk from this virus,

1764
00:53:21.236 --> 00:53:23.445
them at high risk from this virus,
as soon as you receive this, you

1765
00:53:23.445 --> 00:53:25.695
as soon as you receive this, you
should now stay—at—home for the next

1766
00:53:25.695 --> 00:53:26.028
should now stay-at-home for the next
12 weeks

1767
00:53:26.028 --> 00:53:27.736
should now stay—at—home for the next
12 weeks and have no face to face

1768
00:53:27.736 --> 00:53:29.445
12 weeks and have no face to face
contact the van with the loved ones

1769
00:53:29.445 --> 00:53:32.778
contact the van with the loved ones
who are in your household already.

1770
00:53:32.778 --> 00:53:36.153
who are in your household already.
It is almost unimaginable. None of

1771
00:53:36.153 --> 00:53:37.695
It is almost unimaginable. None of
us take this decision lightly.

1772
00:53:37.695 --> 00:53:39.778
us take this decision lightly.
Having said that, if we can look

1773
00:53:39.778 --> 00:53:40.153
Having said that, if we ran look
after

1774
00:53:40.153 --> 00:53:42.570
Having said that, if we can look
after these people, we have used the

1775
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.903
after these people, we have used the
term shielding, if you can

1776
00:53:43.903 --> 00:53:45.445
term shielding, if you can
metaphorically put our arms around

1777
00:53:45.445 --> 00:53:45.778
metaphorically put our arms around
those peopla

1778
00:53:45.778 --> 00:53:47.778
metaphorically put our arms around
those people then that is the best

1779
00:53:47.778 --> 00:53:47.945
those people then that is the best
“Y

1780
00:53:47.945 --> 00:53:50.361
those people then that is the best
way of protecting the country. I

1781
00:53:50.361 --> 00:53:52.820
way of protecting the country. I
fully agree. Because they are the

1782
00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.320
fully agree. Because they are the
most at risk people. That is why the

1783
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.778
most at risk peopla. That is why the
work we

1784
00:53:54.778 --> 00:53:58.653
most at risk people. That is why the
work we are doing with getting food

1785
00:53:58.653 --> 00:53:59.986
work we are doing with getting food
parcels and delivering medicines, it

1786
00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:01.361
parcels and delivering medicines, it
will save thousands of lives if it

1787
00:54:01.361 --> 00:54:04.903
will save thousands of lives if it
works. We have had a tweet come in

1788
00:54:04.903 --> 00:54:07.820
works. We have had a tweet come in
in the last A0 seconds from Eleanor

1789
00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.195
in the last 40 seconds from Eleanor
Chapman who

1790
00:54:08.195 --> 00:54:10.653
in the last A0 seconds from Eleanor
Chapman who asks, how long does the

1791
00:54:10.653 --> 00:54:11.486
Chapman who asks, how long does the
government anticipate this pandemic

1792
00:54:11.486 --> 00:54:14.236
government anticipate this pandemic
will last and that is the $64,000

1793
00:54:14.236 --> 00:54:15.986
will last and that is the $64,000
question. How long will it last and

1794
00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:16.361
question. How long will it last and
how ran

1795
00:54:16.361 --> 00:54:18.986
question. How long will it last and
how can we keep going if it goes on?

1796
00:54:18.986 --> 00:54:19.778
how ran we keep going if it goes on?
What

1797
00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:19.903
how ran we keep going if it goes on?
what is

1798
00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:21.403
how can we keep going if it goes on?
What is the scientific best estimate

1799
00:54:21.403 --> 00:54:21.820
what is the scientific best estimate
for the

1800
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.195
What is the scientific best estimate
for the moment? We have about 20

1801
00:54:23.195 --> 00:54:25.070
for the moment? We have about 20
seconds but it is an important

1802
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:28.320
seconds but it is an important
question. Prepare yourself for 11 or

1803
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.528
question. Prepare yourself for 11 or
12 weeks in this country. Remember,

1804
00:54:30.528 --> 00:54:33.111
12 weeks in this country. Remember,
this outbreak will come back, most

1805
00:54:33.111 --> 00:54:35.570
this outbreak will come back, most
likely later in the year in a second

1806
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.403
likely later in the year in a second
wave and possibly a third wave. We

1807
00:54:37.403 --> 00:54:39.778
wave and possibly a third wave. We
don’t know enough about the virus

1808
00:54:39.778 --> 00:54:41.028
don’t know enough about the virus
yet to be 100%

1809
00:54:41.028 --> 00:54:42.236
don’t know enough about the virus
yet to be100% sure but we are

1810
00:54:42.236 --> 00:54:42.820
yet to be10096 sure but we are
seeing it go

1811
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.361
yet to be100% sure but we are
seeing it go across the world east

1812
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:46.986
seeing it go across the world east
to west, America, Latin America,

1813
00:54:46.986 --> 00:54:49.778
to west, America, Latin America,
Africa, there is a lot more to come.

1814
00:54:49.778 --> 00:54:52.028
Africa, there is a lot more to come.
On that very jolly

1815
00:54:52.028 --> 00:54:53.278
Africa, there is a lot more to come.

00:55:40.611 --> 00:55:44.820
questions from some of you. From all
of us at Question Time, and by.

1843
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:13.778
Remember when the news
was nothing but...

1844
00:56:13.778 --> 00:56:15.111
Brexit!

1845
00:56:15.111 --> 00:56:17.528
Brexit deal to deal with Brexit.
Oven—ready Brexit.

1846
00:56:17.528 --> 00:56:19.986
Back to face a new challenge...

1847
00:56:23.153 --> 00:56:25.570
I’m feeling nostalgic for
the Brexit question!

1848
00:56:28.236 --> 00:56:29.736
Peter Kay’s back. ..

1849
00:56:34.278 --> 00:56:38.028
..returning with some
of his finest and funniest moments

1850
00:56:38.028 --> 00:56:39.695
in the new series of Comedy Shuffle.

1851
00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:49.320
Twin brothers...

1852
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.445
Divided by a secret.

1853
00:56:51.445 --> 00:56:53.778
MUSIC: Always On My Own by Cat Power

1854
00:56:59.778 --> 00:57:01.861
IN NORWEGIAN:

1855
00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:11.778
Kristofer Hivju stars
in compelling Norwegian drama...

1856
00:57:16.486 --> 00:57:19.236
I lost someone who I loved
in this conflict, too.

1857
00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:21.070
And that makes us sisters, does it?

1858
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:24.403
Eyes on, sir. Any problems,
we need to move quickly.

1859
00:57:24.403 --> 00:57:27.236
Sir, Lane has company.
And they’re armed.

1860
00:57:27.236 --> 00:57:28.820
They’re being ambushed! Move! Move!

1861
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.070
Iflllllilill

1862
00:58:00.195 --> 00:58:02.236
This programme contains
some strong language.

1863
00:58:02.236 --> 00:58:05.070
I’vejust seen him, on my way here.
He wants something. What’s going on?

1864
00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:07.778
Meggie’s leaving my employment.
You’re the only one who sees me.

1865
00:58:07.778 --> 00:58:09.778
Mr Dorn,
you want the Prime Minister gone,

1866
00:58:09.778 --> 00:58:11.111
I want the Prime Minister gone.

1867
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:14.028
My brother pointed a gun at me
today. I’ve got a job for you.

1868
00:58:15.486 --> 00:58:16.986
What are you doing, McGregor?

1869
00:58:16.986 --> 00:58:19.486
Quitting, Sarge. Remember
when you said we should leave?

1870
00:58:19.486 --> 00:58:21.486
That wasn’t serious. Lekon knows.

1871
00:58:21.486 --> 00:58:24.695
Help! Help, somebody! Help, quick!

1872
00:58:24.695 --> 00:58:26.903
Where is she? Demwa’s. But what...
Does it matter?

1873
00:58:30.861 --> 00:58:34.486
This bombing was
an attack on civil society.

1874
00:58:34.486 --> 00:58:38.570
I promise you, those responsible
will be brought to justice.

1875
00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.820
Such an act is not only callous
and cowardly, it is

1876
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:45.820
an act of treason and will be met
with the full force of the state.

1877
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:50.986
It pained me greatly to learn
that the target of the attack does

1878
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:54.278
now appear to be my own family.

1879
00:58:56.195 --> 00:58:58.486
Cal, can we at least talk.
Please, mate?

1880
00:58:58.486 --> 00:59:00.320
Move!

1881
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.736
As Home Secretary, I will be
rallying to broaden the police’s

1882
00:59:03.736 --> 00:59:07.861
powers of detention,
of surveillance and searches.

1883
00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:11.070
These urgent measures will take
effect immediately.

1884
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.778
Everything all right, lads?

1885
00:59:17.778 --> 00:59:20.070
Yeah, we’re cool.

1886
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:21.820
Right, Cal?

1887
00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.320
Yeah.
