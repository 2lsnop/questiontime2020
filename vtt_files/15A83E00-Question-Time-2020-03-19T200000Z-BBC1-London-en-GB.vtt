75
00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:36.297
equipment for patients and
protective equipment for staff when

76
00:02:36.297 --> 00:02:38.755
protective equipment for staff when
the NHS becomes overwhelmed? Matt,

77
00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:41.672
the NHS becomes overwhelmed? Matt,
since we have you here, let’s start

78
00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:43.963
since we have you here, let’s start
with that, an issue about

79
00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.213
with that, an issue about
ventilators as well as protective

80
00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:46.588
ventilators as well as protective
equipment. There does not appear to

81
00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:49.213
equipment. There does not appear to
be enough but what is being done?

82
00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:51.380
be enough but what is being done?
This is incredibly important. The

83
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.130
This is incredibly important. The
front line staff of the NHS to an

84
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.880
front line staff of the NHS to an
amazing job all the time but in the

85
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.880
amazing job all the time but in the
coming weeks, they will be called on

86
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.588
coming weeks, they will be called on
for a heroic effort.

87
00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:03.505
coming weeks, they will be called on
for a heroic effort. I know that

88
00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:06.463
for a heroic effort. I know that
there are concerns on the front line

89
00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:07.922
there are concerns on the front line
around making sure that the

90
00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:10.963

sanitiser, and we have a growing

97
00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:22.672
sanitiser, and we have a growing
effort to get that equipment to the

98
00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:26.297
effort to get that equipment to the
front line. That is a huge

99
00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:27.713
front line. That is a huge
government effort that is going on

got it to them already. It is a

130
00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:23.713
got it to them already. It is a
massive effort from the NHS, that

131
00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.130
massive effort from the NHS, that
sunplv

132

about ventilators which are

136
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.338
about ventilators which are
particularly important because of

137
00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:34.547
particularty important because of
the

138
00:04:34.547 --> 00:04:35.588
particularly important because of
the nature of coronavirus and we

139
00:04:35.588 --> 00:04:37.338
the nature of coronavirus and we
learned from what happened in Italy

140
00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:40.588
learned from what happened in Italy
that they are critical. We have

141
00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:41.505
that they are critical. We have
increased the capacity for

142
00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:45.380
increased the capacity for
ventilators in the NHS already and

143
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.130
ventilators in the NHS already and

146
00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:50.380
cork out at the weekend for people
to make more of them because

147
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.588
to make more of them because
although we are buying them at the

148
00:04:52.588 --> 00:04:54.672
although we are buying them at the
moment, we will clearly need more.

149
00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:55.172
moment, we will dearty need more.
We have

150
00:04:55.172 --> 00:04:56.838
moment, we will clearly need more.
We have had an amazing response to

151
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.172
We have had an amazing response to
that, at 1400

152
00:04:58.172 --> 00:04:58.838
We have had an amazing response to
that, at M00 companies have come

153
00:04:58.838 --> 00:04:58.963
that, at 1400 companies have come
forward

154
00:04:58.963 --> 00:05:00.713
that, at M00 companies have come
forward and said they can turn that

155
00:05:00.713 --> 00:05:02.130
forward and said they ran turn that
manufacturing

156
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.797
forward and said they can turn that
manufacturing capability to make

157
00:05:02.797 --> 00:05:04.172
manufacturing capability to make
ventilators. The next thing we need

158
00:05:04.172 --> 00:05:06.713
ventilators. The next thing we need
to do is train people to use them

159
00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:08.380
to do is train people to use them
because a ventilator without a

160
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.797
because a ventilator without a
trained operator can be dangerous

161
00:05:11.797 --> 00:05:11.922
trained operator ran be dangerous
especially

162
00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:14.130
trained operator can be dangerous
especially the invasive ones for the

163
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.213
especially the invasive ones for the
more serious cases, so we are

164
00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:17.005
more serious rases, so we are
training NHS

165
00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:18.172
more serious cases, so we are
training NHS doctors who are

166
00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.672
training NHS doctors who are
currently doing other things,

167
00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:23.130
currently doing other things,
specialists in other things, for

168
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.505
specialists in other things, for
instance hip and knee operations,

169
00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:26.463
instance hip and knee operations,
training them to be able to put the

170
00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:29.005
training them to be able to put the
ventilators in a case the numbers

171
00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:29.547
ventilators in a rase the numbers
really get that

172
00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:32.588
ventilators in a case the numbers
really get that high. And can I ask,

173
00:05:32.588 --> 00:05:33.130
really get that high. And ran I ask,
because

174
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.672
really get that high. And can I ask,
because it is 25 new countries

175
00:05:34.672 --> 00:05:35.547
because it is 25 new countries
dubbing

176
00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:36.338
because it is 25 new countries
clubbing together to buy ventilators

177
00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:36.672
dubbing together to buy ventilators
in order

178
00:05:36.672 --> 00:05:38.838
clubbing together to buy ventilators
in order to bulk buy them, the UK at

179
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.380
in order to bulk buy them, the UK at
the moment is not part of that but

180
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.172
the moment is not part of that but
will we be? We are invited to be

181
00:05:43.172 --> 00:05:45.588
will we be? We are invited to be
part of that. We are invited but we

182
00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:47.880
part of that. We are invited but we
are not taking part at the moment.

183
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.963
are not taking part at the moment.
We engaged with that process today.

184
00:05:49.963 --> 00:05:55.047
We engaged with that process today.
We are not clear actually how much,

185
00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:56.672
We are not clear actually how much,
how many more ventilators we will

186
00:05:56.672 --> 00:05:57.838
how many more ventilators we will
get through that process so frankly

187
00:05:57.838 --> 00:05:59.505
get through that process so frankly
we are getting on with it and buying

188
00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:02.130
we are getting on with it and buying
them from around the world, from the

189
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.588
them from around the world, from the
UK producers and turning other

190
00:06:05.588 --> 00:06:08.588
UK producers and turning other
companies... Formula 1 have said

191
00:06:08.588 --> 00:06:10.713
companies... Formula 1 have said
they will get their factories that

192
00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:12.755
they will get their factories that
normally create cars and work with

193
00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:14.880
normally create cars and work with
their brilliant engineers to create

194
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.922
their brilliant engineers to create
ventilators. The truth is, Fiona,

195
00:06:18.922 --> 00:06:20.672
ventilators. The truth is, Fiona,
this will be a national effort and

196
00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.005
this will be a national effort and
we have to turn the whole resources

197
00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:25.922
we have to turn the whole resources
of the country to how to best stop

198
00:06:25.922 --> 00:06:29.713
of the country to how to best stop
the growth of the virus, and grow

199
00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:31.630
the growth of the virus, and grow
the NHS capacity to deal with it.

200
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.005
the NHS capacity to deal with it.
Tom, what is your response to what

201
00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:34.547
Tom, what is your response to what
jess said and

202
00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:36.463
Tom, what is your response to what
Jess said and what Matt has said?

203
00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:38.047
Tom, what is your response to what
Jess said and what Matt has said? I

204
00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:38.338
jess said and what Matt has said? I
think the

205
00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:38.838
Jess said and what Matt has said? I
think the important thing,

206
00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:39.838
think the important thing,
ventilators are very important and

207
00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:41.463
ventilators are very important and
there are plans to make more as we

208
00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:43.672
there are plans to make more as we
heard about. It may be that we have

209
00:06:43.672 --> 00:06:45.005
heard about. It may be that we have
to be a bit

210
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:45.630
heard about. It may be that we have
to be a bit innovative and creative

211
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.922
to be a bit innovative and creative
given the nature of this emergency

212
00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:48.713
given the nature of this emergency
which we are facing and I have

213
00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:50.713
which we are facing and I have
worked in parts of the world like

214
00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:52.547
worked in parts of the world like
Southeast Asia and Africa where

215
00:06:52.547 --> 00:06:54.172
Southeast Asia and Africa where
there are ventilators which are made

216
00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.713
there are ventilators which are made
of different spec and work in a

217
00:06:56.713 --> 00:07:00.713
of different spec and work in a
different way. It may be that we

218
00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:02.130
different way. It may be that we
will use ventilators of that sort so

219
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.130
will use ventilators of that sort so
we ran

220
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.172
will use ventilators of that sort so
we can use more quickly and evenly

221
00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:06.172
we ran use more quickly and evenly
ran a data --

222
00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:07.130
we can use more quickly and evenly
can a data —— in Canada they’re

223
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.463
ran a data -- in Canada therre
talking about

224
00:07:07.463 --> 00:07:08.588
can a data —— in Canada they’re
talking about ventilators instead of

225
00:07:08.588 --> 00:07:10.088
talking about ventilators instead of
one Subotic restoration for one

226
00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:11.172
one Subotic restoration for one
person, you can support several

227
00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:12.380
person, you ran support several
people come

228
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.380
person, you can support several
people come up to nine people, as

229
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.130
peopla come up to nine peopla, as
long as they

230
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.213
people come up to nine people, as
long as they have a similar need in

231
00:07:15.213 --> 00:07:16.505
long as they have a similar need in
terms of support point of view feel

232
00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:18.630
terms of support point of view feel
confident we will have enough?

233
00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:20.547
ﬂ

234
00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:21.922
I feel the numbers are going

235
00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:23.422
Ifeel the numbers are going up
dramatically but also the number of

236
00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:24.922
dramatically but also the number of
patients are going up.

237
00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:26.047
m:

238
00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:30.797
We are in uncertain territory and
eight race is on but I’m confident

239
00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:32.172
eight race is on but I’m confident
we are doing everything we can to

240
00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:32.463
we are doing everything we ran to
produce

241
00:07:32.463 --> 00:07:34.713
we are doing everything we can to
produce enough ventilators in time.

242
00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:37.172
produce enough ventilators in time.
In Liverpool where I work, I came

243
00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:38.422
In Liverpool where I work, I came
from the hospital this morning and

244
00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:42.213
from the hospital this morning and
at the moment we have two ventilated

245
00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:44.963
at the moment we have two ventilated
patients but capacity for about 20.

246
00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:47.422
patients but capacity for about 20.
Depending on where you are in the

247
00:07:47.422 --> 00:07:48.713
Depending on where you are in the
country, clearly in London the

248
00:07:48.713 --> 00:07:49.172
country, dearty in London the
strain is

249
00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:50.505
country, clearly in London the
strain is greater and that is where

250
00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:52.047
strain is greater and that is where
the need for new ventilators will be

251
00:07:52.047 --> 00:07:55.797
the need for new ventilators will be
first. Let me ask you a response, we

252
00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:57.213
first. Let me ask you a response, we
have heard so many doctors saying

253
00:07:57.213 --> 00:07:58.630
have heard so many doctors saying
they don’t feel they have enough

254
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.588
they don’t feel they have enough
equipment and they’re putting their

255
00:07:59.588 --> 00:07:59.797
equipment and therre putting their
own

256
00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:03.047
equipment and they’re putting their
own lives at risk,.

257
00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:04.713
equipment and they’re putting their
own lives at risk,. You have got to

258
00:08:04.713 --> 00:08:05.713
own lives at risk,. You have got to
feel for jess and

259
00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:06.130
own lives at risk,. You have got to
feel forJess and her colleagues

260
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:06.505
feel for jess and her colleagues
right now

261
00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:08.005
feel forJess and her colleagues
right now but I remember hearing it

262
00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:10.047
right now but I remember hearing it
in 2009 when I was dealing with

263
00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:13.338
in 2009 when I was dealing with
swine flu. Know when they

264
00:08:13.338 --> 00:08:13.880
in 2009 when I was dealing with
swine flu. Know when they rate ——

265
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.547
swine ﬂu. Know when they rate --
nowhere

266
00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:16.338
swine flu. Know when they rate ——
nowhere near as serious as this but

267
00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:17.505
nowhere near as serious as this but
nonetheless serious so I know how

268
00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:19.838
nonetheless serious so I know how
hard it is to be Matt right now.

269
00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:21.755
hard it is to be Matt right now.
It’s a difficult position and we all

270
00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:23.422
It’s a difficult position and we all
have an interest in him succeeding

271
00:08:23.422 --> 00:08:25.922
have an interest in him succeeding
so nothing I say will be point

272
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.338
so nothing I say will be point
scoring, I would give my perspective

273
00:08:27.338 --> 00:08:30.588
scoring, I would give my perspective
in terms of where we are. I was

274
00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:33.130
in terms of where we are. I was
hearing today that staff are reusing

275
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.297
hearing today that staff are reusing
protective masks in hospitals at the

276
00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:36.755
protective masks in hospitals at the
moment. I was glad to hear that

277
00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:38.755
moment. I was glad to hear that
lorries are on the road tonight but

278
00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:40.380
lorries are on the road tonight but
that is quite urgent and it should

279
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.713
that is quite urgent and it should
not be the case that any person in

280
00:08:43.713 --> 00:08:44.713
not be the use that any person in
jess’s petition

281
00:08:44.713 --> 00:08:45.588
not be the case that any person in
Jess’s petition should be using

282
00:08:45.588 --> 00:08:45.963
jess’s petition should be using
crucial

283
00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:46.963
Jess’s petition should be using
crucial equipment. Hopefully that

284
00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:49.130
crucial equipment. Hopefully that
will be put right in the NHS but

285
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.213
will be put right in the NHS but
there is a social care —— in her

286
00:08:51.213 --> 00:08:52.088
there is a social rare -- in her
position. Social

287
00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:53.130
there is a social care —— in her
position. Social care also need that

288
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.172
position. Social rare also need that
equipment

289
00:08:53.172 --> 00:08:54.880
position. Social care also need that
equipment and that is the next

290
00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.130
equipment and that is the next
priority. On capacity, I remember in

291
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.130
priority. On capacity, I remember in
2009 agonising about it, how we

292
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.338
2009 agonising about it, how we
could get more equipment income if

293
00:09:03.338 --> 00:09:05.172
could get more equipment income if
we could open more intensive care

294
00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:05.547
we could open more intensive rare
beds and

295
00:09:05.547 --> 00:09:07.838
we could open more intensive care
beds and went to the same thing. I

296
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:10.630
beds and went to the same thing. I
hear what the Secretary of State is

297
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.005
hear what the Secretary of State is
saying about Formula 1 and

298
00:09:12.005 --> 00:09:13.130
saying about Formula 1 and
manufacturing capability. I would

299
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.880
manufacturing capability. I would
say to go a bit more route one, to

300
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.463
say to go a bit more route one, to
the private health care industry

301
00:09:18.463 --> 00:09:18.755
the private health rare industry
pundit

302
00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:19.880
the private health care industry
pundit there are beds and facilities

303
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.797
pundit there are beds and facilities
in private medicine in your

304
00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:23.422
in private medicine in your
emergency bill, I would say to take

305
00:09:23.422 --> 00:09:25.338
emergency bill, I would say to take
power to take over that capacity.

306
00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:27.005
power to take over that capacity.
That surely has to be the first

307
00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.630
That surely has to be the first
thing you would do if there was a

308
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.172
thing you would do if there was a
crucial shortage. We should not be

309
00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:33.005
crucial shortage. We should not be
thinking about rationing. We should

310
00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:36.005
thinking about rationing. We should
be using every power at our disposal

311
00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:37.713
be using every power at our disposal
to get health capacity available to

312
00:09:37.713 --> 00:09:39.422
to get health capacity available to
the public as well as thinking about

313
00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:40.338
the public as well as thinking about
the man puncturing solutions that

314
00:09:40.338 --> 00:09:42.588
the man puncturing solutions that
might be out there. Frances, what is

315
00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:43.588
might be out there. Frances, what is
your view on that?

316
00:09:43.588 --> 00:09:45.838
might be out there. Frances, what is
your view on that? First of all,

317
00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:47.422
your view on that? First of all,
it’s important to pay tribute to

318
00:09:47.422 --> 00:09:48.588
it’s important to pay tribute to
peopla like

319
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:48.755
it’s important to pay tribute to
people like Jess

320
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.380
it’s important to pay tribute to
people likeJess who are dedicated

321
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.463
people likeJess who are dedicated
professionals and doing an

322
00:09:51.463 --> 00:09:51.630
professionals and doing an
incredible

323
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.130
professionals and doing an
incrediblejob in

324
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.255
professionals and doing an
incredible job in difficult

325
00:09:52.255 --> 00:09:54.338
incredible job in difficult
circumstances.

326
00:09:54.338 --> 00:09:56.338
incredible job in difficult
circumstances. As the TUC and

327
00:09:56.338 --> 00:10:00.422
circumstances. As the TUC and
unions, we represent staff in the

328
00:10:00.422 --> 00:10:05.005
unions, we represent staff in the
health service. Of course we are not

329
00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:06.130
health service. Of course we are not
just talking about doctors and

330
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.255
just talking about doctors and
nurses. It is really important to

331
00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:10.630
nurses. It is really important to
remember we are talking about

332
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.338
remember we are talking about
cleaners and porters and all the

333
00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:16.338
cleaners and porters and all the
other support staff because without

334
00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:17.713
other support staff because without
them, our hospitals cannot function.

335
00:10:17.713 --> 00:10:18.797
them, our hospitals rannot function.
What

336
00:10:18.797 --> 00:10:18.963
them, our hospitals rannot function.
what we

337
00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:20.005
them, our hospitals cannot function.
What we are hearing is exactly as

338
00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:21.713
what we are hearing is exactly as
jess is saying,

339
00:10:21.713 --> 00:10:24.880
What we are hearing is exactly as
Jess is saying, people need masks,

340
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.922
jess is saying, peopla need masks,
soap,

341
00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:26.713
Jess is saying, people need masks,
soap, equipment to fight this

342
00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:29.880
soap, equipment to fight this
pandemic. They are telling you they

343
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.047
pandemic. They are telling you they
don’t have enough soap? We have had

344
00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:36.297
don’t have enough soap? We have had
that. You have to remember that this

345
00:10:36.297 --> 00:10:38.172
that. You have to remember that this
is a team. People see themselves as

346
00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.088
is a team. People see themselves as
a team in the NHS and they know that

347
00:10:40.088 --> 00:10:41.672
a team in the NHS and they know that
they depend on each other in order

348
00:10:41.672 --> 00:10:44.088
they depend on each other in order
to do the job they have to do. There

349
00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:45.547
to do the job they have to do. There
are real worries and they need to

350
00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:51.172
are real worries and they need to
get that sorted fast. And I am also

351
00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:52.838
get that sorted fast. And I am also
really interested in the ventilators

352
00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:55.338
really interested in the ventilators
point. It is fantastic if we have

353
00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:57.713
point. It is fantastic if we have
manufacturing companies prepared to

354
00:10:57.713 --> 00:11:00.547
manufacturing companies prepared to
switch production. Our unions

355
00:11:00.547 --> 00:11:01.130
switch production. Our unions
representing manufacturing workers

356
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.505
representing manufacturing workers
want to do that

357
00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:03.797
representing manufacturing workers
want to do thatjob but let’s be

358
00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:04.255
want to do that job but let’s be
straight with

359
00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:05.630
want to do thatjob but let’s be
straight with people. It is often

360
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.005
straight with peopla. It is often
not as

361
00:11:06.005 --> 00:11:08.672
straight with people. It is often
not as simple as it sometimes is

362
00:11:08.672 --> 00:11:10.338
not as simple as it sometimes is
portrayed put it switching

363
00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:11.172
portrayed put it switching
manufacturing, getting parts,

364
00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:14.130
manufacturing, getting parts,
sometimes from China not always

365
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.588
sometimes from China not always
easy. Let’s tell people the truth.

366
00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:16.963
easy. Let’s tell peopla the truth.
We are

367
00:11:16.963 --> 00:11:18.255
easy. Let’s tell people the truth.
We are grown—ups and we can take it.

368
00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:19.338
We are grown-ups and we ran take it.
We want to

369
00:11:19.338 --> 00:11:21.588
We are grown—ups and we can take it.
We want to know how long this will

370
00:11:21.588 --> 00:11:24.172
We want to know how long this will
take and, in the meantime, how do we

371
00:11:24.172 --> 00:11:25.755
take and, in the meantime, how do we
get that international cooperation

372
00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:27.213
get that international cooperation
so we get the ventilators to where

373
00:11:27.213 --> 00:11:33.172
so we get the ventilators to where
they need to be most? And that takes

374
00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:33.963
they need to be most? And that takes
cooperation not point scoring

375
00:11:33.963 --> 00:11:34.963
cooperation not point scoring
between nations but helping each

376
00:11:34.963 --> 00:11:37.922
between nations but helping each
other and I could not agree more

377
00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:39.713
other and I could not agree more
with Andy. If we are going to pull

378
00:11:39.713 --> 00:11:42.838
with Andy. If we are going to pull
together as a nation, those private

379
00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:44.380
together as a nation, those private
health care companies need to pull

380
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:44.838
health rare companies need to pull
their weight.

381
00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:46.505
health care companies need to pull
their weight. We have had a message

382
00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:48.130
their weight. We have had a message
already from Rhiannon

383
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.380
their weight. We have had a message
already from RhiannonJackson. When

384
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.755
already from Rhiannon jackson. when
ran we expect

385
00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:52.338
already from Rhiannonjackson. When
can we expect to see protective

386
00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:52.547
ran we expect to see protective
equipment

387
00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:53.380
can we expect to see protective
equipment being delivered to social

388
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.047
equipment being delivered to social
rare

389
00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.172
equipment being delivered to social
care providers? Without it, the

390
00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:57.547
care providers? Without it, the
disabled and elderly will not get

391
00:11:57.547 --> 00:11:57.713
disablad and elderty will not get
the

392
00:11:57.713 --> 00:11:59.380
disabled and elderly will not get
the care they rely on in the

393
00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.463
the rare they rely on in the
community

394
00:11:59.463 --> 00:12:01.005
the care they rely on in the
community or residential setting is

395
00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:02.755
community or residential setting is
our workforce gets ill or worse,

396
00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:03.755
our workforce gets ill or worse,
transfers the virus thus putting

397
00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:05.922
transfers the virus thus putting
more pressure on the NHS. You have

398
00:12:05.922 --> 00:12:07.797
more pressure on the NHS. You have
talked about when you hope NHS work

399
00:12:07.797 --> 00:12:09.672
talked about when you hope NHS work
will have it but what about social

400
00:12:09.672 --> 00:12:11.047
will have it but what about social
rare?

401
00:12:11.047 --> 00:12:14.630
will have it but what about social
care? That is happening as we speak.

402
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.047
rare? That is happening as we speak.
Every one of the

403
00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:16.505
care? That is happening as we speak.
Every one of the 25,000 different

404
00:12:16.505 --> 00:12:20.130
Every one of the 25,000 different
places where people are either in

405
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.130
places where people are either in
social rare,

406
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.797
places where people are either in
social care, in a care home, or

407
00:12:22.797 --> 00:12:23.713
social rare, in a rare home, or
providers, those

408
00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:25.630
social care, in a care home, or
providers, those who go out to

409
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.130
providers, those who go out to
people’s homes, every single one of

410
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.505
people’s homes, every single one of
those providers will get a package

411
00:12:31.505 --> 00:12:33.547
those providers will get a package
of personal protective equipment.

412
00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:36.713
of personal protective equipment.
And then we will make sure that more

413
00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:38.130
And then we will make sure that more
keeps coming according to the scale

414
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.130
keeps coming according to the scale
of the operation. It’s a very

415
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.630
of the operation. It’s a very
complicated logistical effort,

416
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.005
complicated logistical effort,
especially with the social care

417
00:12:45.005 --> 00:12:45.255
especially with the social rare
providers

418
00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:48.172
especially with the social care
providers because there are so many.

419
00:12:48.172 --> 00:12:50.380
providers because there are so many.
Some are very small care homes, up

420
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.963
Some are very small rare homes, up
to the biggest

421
00:12:50.963 --> 00:12:53.547
Some are very small care homes, up
to the biggest with a lot of homes.

422
00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:54.338
to the biggest with a lot of homes.
And they rare

423
00:12:54.338 --> 00:12:55.755
to the biggest with a lot of homes.
And they care for lots of people in

424
00:12:55.755 --> 00:12:56.130
And they rare for lots of peopla in
their own

425
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.338
And they care for lots of people in
their own home. Social care is

426
00:12:58.338 --> 00:12:58.755
their own home. Social rare is
absolutely

427
00:12:58.755 --> 00:12:59.380
their own home. Social care is
absolutely getting the protective

428
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.547
absolutely getting the protective
equipment. When you anticipate they

429
00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:02.130
equipment. when you anticipate they
will get that

430
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.963
equipment. When you anticipate they
will get that and when will it be

431
00:13:03.963 --> 00:13:05.630
will get that and when will it be
resolved? It is being resolved right

432
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.422
resolved? It is being resolved right
now and I would have thought that by

433
00:13:07.422 --> 00:13:09.338
now and I would have thought that by
the end of next week every social

434
00:13:09.338 --> 00:13:11.672
the end of next week every social
rare provider

435
00:13:11.672 --> 00:13:13.713
the end of next week every social
care provider will have that, that

436
00:13:13.713 --> 00:13:15.130
rare provider will have that, that
is the goal but

437
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.172
care provider will have that, that
is the goal but there was a broader

438
00:13:16.172 --> 00:13:19.130
is the goal but there was a broader
point. Often we talk about the NHS

439
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.880
point. Often we talk about the NHS
and especially in political debate

440
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.672
and especially in political debate
is about the NHS. Really, the NHS

441
00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:26.963
is about the NHS. Really, the NHS
and social care together is

442
00:13:26.963 --> 00:13:27.963
and social rare together is
critical,

443
00:13:27.963 --> 00:13:28.797
and social care together is
critical, especially because of this

444
00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:30.172
critical, especially because of this
virus is more dangerous for older

445
00:13:30.172 --> 00:13:30.922
virus is more dangerous for older
peopla and we

446
00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:32.297
virus is more dangerous for older
people and we have got to look at

447
00:13:32.297 --> 00:13:32.672
peopla and we have got to look at
the

448
00:13:32.672 --> 00:13:34.047
people and we have got to look at
the whole team. I know you want to

449
00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.130
the whola team. I know you want to
come in but

450
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.130
the whole team. I know you want to
come in but Angela, you run many

451
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.588
come in but Angela, you run many
businesses and we will come onto

452
00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:42.880
businesses and we will come onto
business but what you think hearing

453
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.547
business but what you think hearing
this? You are someone who has

454
00:13:44.547 --> 00:13:47.963
this? You are someone who has
concerns about getting the infection

455
00:13:47.963 --> 00:13:49.297
concerns about getting the infection
yourself or your workers?

456
00:13:49.297 --> 00:13:50.422
concerns about getting the infection
yourself or your workers? Just

457
00:13:50.422 --> 00:13:50.922
yourself or your workers? just
talking to

458
00:13:50.922 --> 00:13:53.005
yourself or your workers? Just
talking to people today before I

459
00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:53.130
talking to peopla today before I
fame

460
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:53.380
talking to peopla today before I
name on,

461
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.172
talking to people today before I
came on, obviously this is not my

462
00:13:55.172 --> 00:13:57.922
came on, obviously this is not my
norm but I think what Frances said,

463
00:13:57.922 --> 00:13:58.130
norm but I think what Frances said,
facts

464
00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.297
norm but I think what Frances said,
facts and accurate facts is what the

465
00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.213
facts and accurate facts is what the
government needs to give us on every

466
00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:01.588
government needs to give us on every
level. If

467
00:14:01.588 --> 00:14:01.797
government needs to give us on every
level. IfI

468
00:14:01.797 --> 00:14:02.922
government needs to give us on every
level. If I was running a care home,

469
00:14:02.922 --> 00:14:03.588
lavel. If I was mnning a rare home,
I would like

470
00:14:03.588 --> 00:14:04.463
level. If I was running a care home,
I would like to know from the

471
00:14:04.463 --> 00:14:06.713
I would like to know from the
government when is it arriving a.

472
00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:09.380
government when is it arriving a.
Saying overnight next week, if I’m

473
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.213
Saying overnight next week, if I’m
absolutely honest, isn’t good

To bring it to a personal thing,

478
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.338
To bring it to a personal thing,
when we are in a crisis like we are,

479
00:14:18.338 --> 00:14:20.672
when we are in a crisis like we are,
we all think about ourselves because

480
00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:23.463
we all think about ourselves because
we are naturally slightly selfish.

481
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.588
we are naturally slightly selfish.

many people are. When is that care

490
00:14:38.588 --> 00:14:38.797
it needs to protect the elderty? I
think

491
00:14:38.797 --> 00:14:40.755
it needs to protect the elderly? I
think probably they are the most

492
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:41.963
think probably they are the most
vulnerable people in society at the

493
00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:45.755
vulnerable people in society at the
moment. We need the facts to know

494
00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:51.130
moment. We need the facts to know
when all this is happening. And I’m

495
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.922
when all this is happening. And I’m
saying it in a laissez faire

496
00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:55.005
saying it in a laissez faire
attitude but the more information

497
00:14:55.005 --> 00:14:57.755
attitude but the more information
and accurate information the public

498
00:14:57.755 --> 00:15:00.255
and accurate information the public
gets, we are so nervous now, it will

499
00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:01.963
gets, we are so nervous now, it will
calm people down. I think what is

500
00:15:01.963 --> 00:15:02.755
calm peopla down. I think what is
totally true,

501
00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:04.755
calm people down. I think what is
totally true, we are trying to be as

502
00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:05.630
totally true, we are trying to be as
transparent as possible, including

503
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.463
transparent as possible, including
about the risks. As well as about

504
00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:10.755
about the risks. As well as about
what we’re doing about. Let me put

505
00:15:10.755 --> 00:15:13.630
what we’re doing about. Let me put
another question in. I will try to

506
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.547
another question in. I will try to
get as many questions as I can in

get as many questions as I ran in

so what is your view on this

ﬂ

529
00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:54.005
I think it is critical to test NHS
workers. It is critical to test

530
00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:56.505
workers. It is critical to test
everyone if we can and the number of

531
00:15:56.505 --> 00:15:57.088
everyone if we ran and the number of
tests

532
00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:58.505
everyone if we can and the number of
tests available are going up, so it

533
00:15:58.505 --> 00:16:00.797
tests available are going up, so it
is these two curves. At the moment,

534
00:16:00.797 --> 00:16:03.005
is these two curves. At the moment,
the number of cases is greater than

535
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:04.255
the number of rases is greater than
our ability to

536
00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.130
the number of cases is greater than
our ability to test but the testing

537
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.130
our ability to test but the testing
ability is ramping up and we want

538
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.797
ability is ramping up and we want
the testing ability to overtake the

539
00:16:09.797 --> 00:16:11.713
the testing ability to overtake the
number of cases. Given that we

540
00:16:11.713 --> 00:16:13.338
number of cases. Given that we
cannot test everyone at the moment,

541
00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:14.130
rannot test everyone at the moment,
the priority has

542
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.505
cannot test everyone at the moment,
the priority has to be first of all

543
00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:17.755
the priority has to be first of all
the patients, and that is happening

544
00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:19.463
the patients, and that is happening
now, and the second priority I think

545
00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:21.547
now, and the second priority I think
has to be health care workers

546
00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:21.797
has to be health rare workers
because,

547
00:16:21.797 --> 00:16:23.547
has to be health care workers
because, at the moment, if somebody,

548
00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:24.672
because, at the moment, if somebody,
you know, if

549
00:16:24.672 --> 00:16:25.463
because, at the moment, if somebody,
you know, ifI have

550
00:16:25.463 --> 00:16:26.463
because, at the moment, if somebody,
you know, if I have a cough, then I

551
00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:26.838
you know, ifI have a cough, then I
had to

552
00:16:26.838 --> 00:16:28.380
you know, if I have a cough, then I
had to isolate myself at home for

553
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.922
had to isolate myself at home for
seven days and then I will be going

554
00:16:30.922 --> 00:16:32.963
seven days and then I will be going
back to work and we won’t know

555
00:16:32.963 --> 00:16:34.422
back to work and we won’t know
whether I had coronavirus or not. I

556
00:16:34.422 --> 00:16:36.255
whether I had coronavirus or not. I
might then have another cop a week

557
00:16:36.255 --> 00:16:37.880
might then have another cop a week
later and I would have to go for

558
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.380
later and I would have to go for
seven days. Do you think we should

559
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.130
seven days. Do you think we should
have started testing sooner? I think

560
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.380
have started testing sooner? I think
we started testing incredibly

561
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.755
we started testing incredibly
quickly. The minute the Chinese

562
00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:49.172
quickly. The minute the Chinese
released the information about the

563
00:16:49.172 --> 00:16:52.255
released the information about the
genetic information of this virus,

genetic information of this virus,
Public Health England created a test

566
00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:55.172
Public Health England created a test
as soon as they possibly could and

567
00:16:55.172 --> 00:16:57.463
as soon as they possibly could and
then the issue is about scaling back

568
00:16:57.463 --> 00:17:02.922
then the issue is about scaling back
test up. You know, when we had five,

569
00:17:02.922 --> 00:17:03.463
test up. You know, when we had five,
ten cases in

570
00:17:03.463 --> 00:17:04.713
test up. You know, when we had five,
ten cases inJanuary, then I think

571
00:17:04.713 --> 00:17:05.463
ten cases in january, then I think
if somebody

572
00:17:05.463 --> 00:17:07.047
ten cases inJanuary, then I think
if somebody had said you need to

573
00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:08.672
if somebody had said you need to
make hundreds of thousands of tests,

574
00:17:08.672 --> 00:17:12.255
make hundreds of thousands of tests,
that would have seemed on sensible,

575
00:17:12.255 --> 00:17:13.672
that would have seemed on sensible,
because you just don’t know at the

576
00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:19.130
because you just don’t know at the
start of an outbreak. I know you are

577
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.963
start of an outbreak. I know you are
a specialist in infectious diseases,

578
00:17:23.963 --> 00:17:28.422
a specialist in infectious diseases,
but I am not an expert... It seems

579
00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:31.672
but I am not an expert... It seems
to me that planning for a pandemic

580
00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:32.672
to me that planning for a pandemic
is something our authority should

581
00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:34.047
is something our authority should
have been doing and expect to do

582
00:17:34.047 --> 00:17:35.672
have been doing and expect to do
because it is the scale of the issue

583
00:17:35.672 --> 00:17:38.922
because it is the scale of the issue
and, let’s be honest about this,

584
00:17:38.922 --> 00:17:40.255
and, let’s be honest about this,
health staff and indeed staff in

585
00:17:40.255 --> 00:17:41.922
health staff and indeed staff in
social care are putting their health

586
00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:43.130
social rare are putting their health
on the

587
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.005
social care are putting their health
on the line for us, and it seems to

588
00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:46.963
on the line for us, and it seems to
me that the least they deserve is to

589
00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:48.838
me that the least they deserve is to
get tests and, also, because that’s

590
00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:51.338
get tests and, also, because that’s
the best way we can deliver the

591
00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:51.755
the best way we ran deliver the
service, so

592
00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:52.880
the best way we can deliver the
service, so that we can get people

593
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.380
service, so that we ran get people
back to

594
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.297
service, so that we can get people
back to work quickly. I would agree

595
00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:58.297
back to work quickly. I would agree
with that. As we’ve heard, we now

596
00:17:58.297 --> 00:17:59.505
with that. As we’ve heard, we now
have a Department of Health and

597
00:17:59.505 --> 00:17:59.922
have a Department of Health and
social rare,

598
00:17:59.922 --> 00:18:02.172
have a Department of Health and
social care, this is one team of

599
00:18:02.172 --> 00:18:02.422
social rare, this is one team of
workers

600
00:18:02.422 --> 00:18:04.297
social care, this is one team of
workers and testing, I think, of key

601
00:18:04.297 --> 00:18:07.047
workers and testing, I think, of key
workers goes across the board. I

602
00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:08.755
workers goes across the board. I
couldn’t agree more. I chaired the

603
00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:12.255
couldn’t agree more. I chaired the
first meeting yesterday of the way

604
00:18:12.255 --> 00:18:13.588
first meeting yesterday of the way
to Manchester Covid—19 committee and

605
00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:14.672
to Manchester Covid-19 committee and
I put the all out

606
00:18:14.672 --> 00:18:15.255
to Manchester Covid—19 committee and
I put the call out before I went

607
00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:15.713
I put the all out before I went
about

608
00:18:15.713 --> 00:18:17.422
I put the call out before I went
about what are the issues you think

609
00:18:17.422 --> 00:18:18.672
about what are the issues you think
are not getting the special

610
00:18:18.672 --> 00:18:20.588
are not getting the special
attention that need to be put up the

611
00:18:20.588 --> 00:18:22.755
attention that need to be put up the
priority list and testing of NHS and

612
00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:24.713
priority list and testing of NHS and
social care staff was the issue that

613
00:18:24.713 --> 00:18:24.797
social rare staff was the issue that
fame

614
00:18:24.797 --> 00:18:26.672
social care staff was the issue that
came back. NHS staff clearly don’t

615
00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:27.463
came back. NHS staff dearty don’t
think it is

616
00:18:27.463 --> 00:18:28.672
came back. NHS staff clearly don’t
think it is happening fast enough,

617
00:18:28.672 --> 00:18:30.047
think it is happening fast enough,
they are tweeting, they are putting

618
00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:33.130
they are tweeting, they are putting
things in the paper. This is an area

619
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.963
things in the paper. This is an area
we focused on a lot in 2009. And I

620
00:18:35.963 --> 00:18:37.922
we focused on a lot in 2009. And I
know it was part of the pandemic

621
00:18:37.922 --> 00:18:39.672
know it was part of the pandemic
plan, but when there was this

622
00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:41.963
plan, but when there was this
feeling of we are going for a more

623
00:18:41.963 --> 00:18:43.880
feeling of we are going for a more
herd immunity approach, may I was

624
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.838
herd immunity approach, may I was
taken off the ball up testing a

625
00:18:45.838 --> 00:18:49.880
taken off the ball up testing a
little more, I don’t know. Matt may

626
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.172
little more, I don’t know. Matt may
say something different. What I

627
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.255
say something different. what I
heard

00:18:52.255 --> 00:18:53.297
say something different. What I
heard today from a very senior

629
00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:54.255
heard today from a very senior
manager in the National Health

630
00:18:54.255 --> 00:18:56.213
manager in the National Health
Service is there is a lot of

631
00:18:56.213 --> 00:18:57.588
Service is there is a lot of
scepticism in the system about

632
00:18:57.588 --> 00:18:59.422
scepticism in the system about
25,000 tests per day and I would

633
00:18:59.422 --> 00:19:00.130
25,000 tests per day and I would
like to hear

634
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.255
25,000 tests per day and I would
like to hearfrom

635
00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:00.922
25,000 tests per day and I would
like to hear from the Secretary of

636
00:19:00.922 --> 00:19:02.130
like to hear from the Secretary of
State about when that would be

637
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.505
State about when that would be
delivered, because people are saying

638
00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:05.672
delivered, because people are saying
they cannot see how that can be

639
00:19:05.672 --> 00:19:07.672
they cannot see how that can be
delivered anytime soon, because it

640
00:19:07.672 --> 00:19:09.672
delivered anytime soon, because it
requires standing down the screening

641
00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:11.130
requires standing down the screening
capacity and freeing up lab capacity

642
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.713
capacity and freeing up lab capacity
in other parts of the NHS and people

643
00:19:12.713 --> 00:19:13.172
in other parts of the NHS and peopla
are stmggling

644
00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:14.297
in other parts of the NHS and people
are struggling to see when it comes

645
00:19:14.297 --> 00:19:15.713
are stmggling to see when it comes
through. That is

646
00:19:15.713 --> 00:19:17.172
are struggling to see when it comes
through. That is a key issue. Like

647
00:19:17.172 --> 00:19:18.713
through. That is a key issue. Like
the masks, people want to know

648
00:19:18.713 --> 00:19:19.088
the masks, peopla want to know
exactly when

649
00:19:19.088 --> 00:19:20.130
the masks, people want to know
exactly when they will this

650
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.213
exactly when they will this
reassurance.

651
00:19:21.213 --> 00:19:23.672
reassurance.
So when will we see the 25,000

652
00:19:23.672 --> 00:19:27.505
So when will we see the 25,000
tests? I have been buying test

653
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:28.880
tests? I have been buying test
today, that is what I have been

654
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.713
today, that is what I have been
spending most of my day on. Tom is

655
00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:32.463
spending most of my day on. Tom is
absolutely right, Public Health

656
00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:35.088
absolutely right, Public Health
England came out with the first test

657
00:19:35.088 --> 00:19:37.630
England came out with the first test
on this within days of the viral

658
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.880
on this within days of the viral
code being made public and then we

659
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.213
code being made public and then we
have been increasing test capacity

660
00:19:42.213 --> 00:19:44.672
have been increasing test capacity
all the time since then. We have hit

661
00:19:44.672 --> 00:19:46.713
all the time since then. We have hit
a 10000 and we hit that target

662
00:19:46.713 --> 00:19:50.588
a 10000 and we hit that target
sooner than we anticipated and the

663
00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:55.088
sooner than we anticipated and the
problem is that, as the virus, as

664
00:19:55.088 --> 00:19:58.880
problem is that, as the virus, as
the number of people increases on an

665
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.172
the number of people increases on an
exponential curve, the number of

666
00:20:00.172 --> 00:20:02.088
exponential curve, the number of
tests is going up in a linear

667
00:20:02.088 --> 00:20:04.338
tests is going up in a linear
direction and we have got good news,

668
00:20:04.338 --> 00:20:06.755
direction and we have got good news,
though, which is that, from today,

669
00:20:06.755 --> 00:20:10.172
though, which is that, from today,
we have been able to buy a new type

670
00:20:10.172 --> 00:20:12.963
we have been able to buy a new type
of test which is, instead of finding

671
00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:15.505
of test which is, instead of finding
out, having to take the swab, send

672
00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:17.380
out, having to take the swab, send
it to a lab and get it back, which

673
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.005
it to a lab and get it back, which
is taking quite a lot of time and

674
00:20:19.005 --> 00:20:21.505
is taking quite a lot of time and
anyone who has had a test knows it

675
00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:24.255
anyone who has had a test knows it
takes a couple of days at best, the

676
00:20:24.255 --> 00:20:27.463
takes a couple of days at best, the
new type of test allows you to, it

677
00:20:27.463 --> 00:20:28.880
new type of test allows you to, it
is more like a pregnancy test, you

678
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.213
is more like a pregnancy test, you
ran take it

679
00:20:31.213 --> 00:20:32.130
is more like a pregnancy test, you
can take it immediately, it is blood

680
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.880
ran take it immediately, it is blood
prick. This is to

681
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.505
can take it immediately, it is blood
prick. This is to check if you have

682
00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:38.130
prick. This is to check if you have
had coronavirus? If you have had it

683
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.297
had coronavirus? If you have had it
and are immune and have the

684
00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:42.088
and are immune and have the
antibodies. Does that definitely

685
00:20:42.088 --> 00:20:44.130
antibodies. Does that definitely
work and is it definitely going to

686
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.130
work and is it definitely going to
into production? Will we see that?

687
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.088
into production? will we see that?
That is in

688
00:20:48.088 --> 00:20:48.880
into production? Will we see that?
That is in production and we have

689
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.630
That is in production and we have
been buying that today for the first

690
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.088
been buying that today for the first
time. It only got approved in the

691
00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:54.922
time. It only got approved in the
last few days. That is clearly a

692
00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:56.380
last few days. That is clearly a
brilliant step forward and to be

693
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.005
brilliant step forward and to be
welcomed but it is a different type

694
00:20:58.005 --> 00:21:01.088
welcomed but it is a different type
of test. What Andy is asking you is

695
00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:01.422
of test. what Andy is asking you is
the 25,000

696
00:21:01.422 --> 00:21:03.630
of test. What Andy is asking you is
the 25,000 tests per day, when is

697
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.130
the 25,000 tests per day, when is
that going to happen? That is going

698
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.588
that going to happen? That is going
to happen in the next couple of

699
00:21:07.588 --> 00:21:09.755
to happen in the next couple of
weeks. We are going as fast as we

700
00:21:09.755 --> 00:21:10.797
weeks. We are going as fast as we
ran but

701
00:21:10.797 --> 00:21:13.130
weeks. We are going as fast as we
can but we are also, on the test for

702
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.713
ran but we are also, on the test for
whether you

703
00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:14.297
can but we are also, on the test for
whether you have the coronavirus,

704
00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:14.672
whether you have the coronavims,
which is

705
00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:16.755
whether you have the coronavirus,
which is different from the test of

706
00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:18.338
which is different from the test of
whether you have had coronavirus,

707
00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:18.713
whether you have had coronavims,
the test

708
00:21:18.713 --> 00:21:22.130
whether you have had coronavirus,
the test of whether you have it now,

709
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.297
the test of whether you have it now,
we are also working with some of the

710
00:21:24.297 --> 00:21:25.963
we are also working with some of the
leading companies in the field

711
00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:27.088
leading companies in the field
radically to increase the number of

712
00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:31.463
radically to increase the number of
those tests. Because I totally agree

713
00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:33.922
those tests. Because I totally agree
with the world of their health ——

with the world of their health --

the head of the World Health
Organisation, the way that we can

Organisation, the way that we can
understand what is happening, who

718
00:21:41.922 --> 00:21:43.588
understand what is happening, who
has got coronavirus and who has had

719
00:21:43.588 --> 00:21:45.630
has got coronavirus and who has had
it and both treat people better but

720
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.172
it and both treat people better but
also slow the spread is the

721
00:21:49.172 --> 00:21:50.255
also slow the spread is the
combination of understanding who has

722
00:21:50.255 --> 00:21:55.380
combination of understanding who has
got it through the testing, who has

723
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.380
got it through the testing, who has
got it and ran

724
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.672
got it through the testing, who has
got it and can go back to work and

725
00:21:57.672 --> 00:21:58.672
got it and ran go back to work and
it is only the

726
00:21:58.672 --> 00:21:59.005
got it and can go back to work and
it is only the combination of

727
00:21:59.005 --> 00:22:01.255
it is only the combination of
technology and testing where we can

728
00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:02.797
technology and testing where we ran
get a grip on

729
00:22:02.797 --> 00:22:04.505
technology and testing where we can
get a grip on this curve and,

730
00:22:04.505 --> 00:22:06.255
get a grip on this curve and,
hopefully, in time, reduce some of

731
00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:07.130
hopefully, in time, reduce some of
the incredibly Draconian measures

732
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.255
the incredibly Draconian measures
that we’ve had to take this week.

733

that we’ve had to take this week.
0K,

734
00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:12.005
that we’ve had to take this week.
OK, I’m going to take a slightly

735
00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:13.505
OK, I’m going to take a slightly
different tack on a subject for a

736
00:22:13.505 --> 00:22:15.380
different tack on a subject for a
moment, I want to hear

737
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.255
different tack on a subject for a
moment, I want to hearfrom another

nine people, I am concerned about
the future of the business. There

747
00:22:28.338 --> 00:22:30.463
the future of the business. There
are many services such as ours where

are many services such as ours where
workers --

last night, it is four restaurants I

782
00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:22.880
last night, it is four restaurants I
have, 140 people approximately that

783
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.255
have, 140 peopla approximately that
we have

784
00:23:23.255 --> 00:23:25.088
have, 140 people approximately that
we have asked to go on to unpaid

785
00:23:25.088 --> 00:23:28.713
we have asked to go on to unpaid
leave. Some may want redundancy. I

786
00:23:28.713 --> 00:23:31.422
leave. Some may want redundancy. I
have done it for a few reasons. One,

787
00:23:31.422 --> 00:23:32.963
have done it for a few reasons. One,
as I said before, it is the

788
00:23:32.963 --> 00:23:34.630
as I said before, it is the
information coming from the

789
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.213
information coming from the
Government. So many flying rumours

790
00:23:36.213 --> 00:23:36.380
Government. So many ﬂying mmours
around

791
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.380
Government. 50 many flying rumours
around that London is on lockdown,

792
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.172
around that London is on lockdown,
is it not? I employ European staff,

793
00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:44.422
is it not? I employ European staff,
so I wanted the opportunity for them

794
00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:46.005
so I wanted the opportunity for them
to go home. When the Prime Minister

795
00:23:46.005 --> 00:23:47.255
to go home. when the Prime Minister
stood up on the

796
00:23:47.255 --> 00:23:47.547
to go home. When the Prime Minister
stood up on the Tuesday press

797
00:23:47.547 --> 00:23:51.088
stood up on the Tuesday press
briefing and said don’t go to clubs,

798
00:23:51.088 --> 00:23:54.088
briefing and said don’t go to clubs,
bars, restaurants, that decimated

799
00:23:54.088 --> 00:23:56.130
bars, restaurants, that decimated
our business. 70, 80% of the

800
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.255
our business. 70, 8096 of the
bookings

801
00:23:56.255 --> 00:23:57.505
our business. 70, 80% of the
bookings were knocked off. And what

802
00:23:57.505 --> 00:23:59.130
bookings were knocked off. And what
are your employees saying to you and

803
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.130
are your employees saying to you and
what have you said to them in terms

804
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.088
what have you said to them in terms
of future employment? We are in

805
00:24:04.088 --> 00:24:04.422
offuture employment? We are in
daily contact,

806
00:24:04.422 --> 00:24:05.463
of future employment? We are in
daily contact, e—mailing over what

807
00:24:05.463 --> 00:24:06.213
daily contact, e-mailing over what
is happening.

808
00:24:06.213 --> 00:24:07.172
daily contact, e—mailing over what
is happening. We are waiting, we

809
00:24:07.172 --> 00:24:09.297
is happening. We are waiting, we
need initiatives from the

810
00:24:09.297 --> 00:24:10.297
need initiatives from the
Government. Fantastic that the

811
00:24:10.297 --> 00:24:11.963
Government. Fantastic that the
Chancellor gave us these billions

812
00:24:11.963 --> 00:24:13.630
Chancellor gave us these billions
and billions of pounds. What we need

813
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.005
and billions of pounds. what we need
now, if you like,

814
00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:15.713
and billions of pounds. What we need
now, if you like, the laws or

815
00:24:15.713 --> 00:24:18.422
now, if you like, the laws or
however the Government does it to

816
00:24:18.422 --> 00:24:18.588
however the Government does it to
55V

817
00:24:18.588 --> 00:24:20.463
however the Government does it to
say landlords give us a free three

818
00:24:20.463 --> 00:24:22.422
say landlords give us a free three
month rent period. Yes, I’m going to

819
00:24:22.422 --> 00:24:24.755
month rent period. Yes, I’m going to
pay every single person in the

820
00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:26.922
pay every single person in the
hospitality sector £1000 a week or a

821
00:24:26.922 --> 00:24:28.088
hospitality sector £1000 a week or a
month to sustain, cover their rent

822
00:24:28.088 --> 00:24:31.338
month to sustain, cover their rent
period. These people are on low

823
00:24:31.338 --> 00:24:33.005
period. These people are on low
incomes. It was bad enough when we

824
00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.255
incomes. It was bad enough when we
were treated as an industry where we

825
00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:37.588
were treated as an industry where we
were called unskilled Labour and

826
00:24:37.588 --> 00:24:39.213
were called unskilled Labour and
unskilled workers. These people have

827
00:24:39.213 --> 00:24:41.463
unskilled workers. These people have
to pay their rent, they have

828
00:24:41.463 --> 00:24:43.297
to pay their rent, they have
families to support, bills to pay.

829
00:24:43.297 --> 00:24:45.255
families to support, bills to pay.
And our industry, we are the third

830
00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:47.963
And our industry, we are the third
biggest employer in the country and

831
00:24:47.963 --> 00:24:50.130
biggest employer in the country and
the knock—on effect, this gentleman

832
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:50.630
the knock-on effect, this gentleman
included, we

833
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.213
the knock—on effect, this gentleman
included, we buy blinds for

834
00:24:51.213 --> 00:24:53.255
included, we buy blinds for
restaurants. It is not

835
00:24:53.255 --> 00:24:53.713
included, we buy blinds for
restaurants. It is notjust the

836
00:24:53.713 --> 00:24:53.880
restaurants. It is not just the
home.

837
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.630
restaurants. It is notjust the
home. And what about the loan is the

838
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.963
home. And what about the loan is the
Government have suggested, is that

839
00:24:56.963 --> 00:25:00.713
Government have suggested, is that
any use? I think it will be but,

840
00:25:00.713 --> 00:25:02.297
any use? I think it will be but,
again, it is how we access them. We

841
00:25:02.297 --> 00:25:04.088
again, it is how we access them. We
need to know the banks will actually

842
00:25:04.088 --> 00:25:04.338
need to know the banks will actually
back-up

843
00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:06.255
need to know the banks will actually
back—up these loans, we have two

844
00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:06.422
back-up these loans, we have two
different

845
00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:07.588
back—up these loans, we have two
different banks and they don’t seem

846
00:25:07.588 --> 00:25:07.838
different banks and they don’t seem
dear

847
00:25:07.838 --> 00:25:11.130
different banks and they don’t seem
clear how they are going to work so,

848
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.672
clear how they are going to work so,
again, information. And, two, it is

849
00:25:13.672 --> 00:25:15.672
again, information. And, two, it is
that double edged sword. We have

850
00:25:15.672 --> 00:25:17.213
that double edged sword. We have
closed restaurants because we felt

851
00:25:17.213 --> 00:25:18.172
dosed restaurants berause we felt
it was

852
00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:19.297
closed restaurants because we felt
it was best for staff, customers,

853
00:25:19.297 --> 00:25:20.672
it was best for staff, customers,
health and safety but there is no

854
00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:21.963
health and safety but there is no
income coming through and we will

855
00:25:21.963 --> 00:25:24.130
income coming through and we will
struggle when we open up. So when we

856
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.922
struggle when we open up. So when we
open up, there will be a cash flow

857
00:25:25.922 --> 00:25:26.422
open up, there will be a rash ﬂow
issue and

858
00:25:26.422 --> 00:25:27.255
open up, there will be a cash flow
issue and we won’t have customers

859
00:25:27.255 --> 00:25:31.963
issue and we won’t have customers
like that so do I get into a loan of

860
00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:32.588
like that so do I get into a loan of
half a million,

861
00:25:32.588 --> 00:25:33.047
like that so do I get into a loan of
halfa million, £1 million?

862
00:25:33.047 --> 00:25:33.172
like that so do I get into a loan of
half a million, £1 million? These

863
00:25:33.172 --> 00:25:33.672
halfa million, £1 million? These
are the

864
00:25:33.672 --> 00:25:34.630
half a million, £1 million? These
are the questions we need to know.

865
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.838
are the questions we need to know.
Or if I take the loan, do I have two

866
00:25:36.838 --> 00:25:37.505
Orifltaketheloan, dolhavetwo

870
00:25:38.088 --> 00:25:39.797
Or if I take the loan, do I have two
years to pay it back? Then I can

871
00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:40.213
years to pay it back? Then I ran
seriously say,

872
00:25:40.213 --> 00:25:41.088
years to pay it back? Then I can
seriously say, fantastic, I can pay

873
00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:41.713
seriously say, fantastic, I ran pay
my staff for

874
00:25:41.713 --> 00:25:43.255
seriously say, fantastic, I can pay
my staff for three months because I

875
00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:45.213
my staff for three months because I
know I have that period. Lots of

876
00:25:45.213 --> 00:25:46.588
know I have that period. Lots of
questions to answer and we need the

877
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:48.172
questions to answer and we need the
information and the feeling is it

878
00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:51.172
information and the feeling is it
will be coming out, but at 5pm, I am

879
00:25:51.172 --> 00:25:53.172
will be coming out, but at 5pm, I am
glued to that TV, what is the

880
00:25:53.172 --> 00:25:55.880
glued to that TV, what is the
Chancellor going to give us? You and

881
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880
Chancellor going to give us? You and
lots of peoplo.

882
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.547
Chancellor going to give us? You and
lots of people. Frances, this is

883
00:25:57.547 --> 00:25:58.213
lots of peopla. Frances, this is
something

884
00:25:58.213 --> 00:25:59.588
lots of people. Frances, this is
something you are hearing a lot,

885
00:25:59.588 --> 00:26:04.297
something you are hearing a lot,
too. Yes, small businesses, even in

886
00:26:04.297 --> 00:26:04.755
too. Yes, small businesses, even in
my [oral

887
00:26:04.755 --> 00:26:05.130
too. Yes, small businesses, even in
my local community, I

888
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.463
too. Yes, small businesses, even in
my local community, Ijust get

889
00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:06.130
too. Yes, small businesses, even in
my local community, I just get that

890
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.005
my [oral community, Ijust get that
sense of a

891
00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:07.838
my local community, I just get that
sense of a real need for certainty

892
00:26:07.838 --> 00:26:11.422
sense of a real need for certainty
and detail, because many of those

893
00:26:11.422 --> 00:26:11.588
sense of a real need for certainty
and detail, because many of those

894
00:26:11.588 --> 00:26:12.380
sense of a real need for certainty
and detail, because many of those

895
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.047
sense of a real need for certainty
and detail, because many of those

896
00:26:14.047 --> 00:26:15.130
and detail, because many of those
announcements are welcome, cash flow

897
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.963
announcements are welcome, rash ﬂow
is a real problem

898
00:26:15.963 --> 00:26:16.838
announcements are welcome, cash flow
is a real problem but if you are

899
00:26:16.838 --> 00:26:18.213
is a real problem but if you are
living on the edge, then you’ve got

900
00:26:18.213 --> 00:26:20.755
living on the edge, then you’ve got
to take decisions so you need to be

901
00:26:20.755 --> 00:26:23.088
to take decisions so you need to be
able to access it quickly and, of

902
00:26:23.088 --> 00:26:25.588
able to access it quickly and, of
course, the staff, what happens to

903
00:26:25.588 --> 00:26:28.755
course, the staff, what happens to
them? Are they straight on to

904
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:30.130
them? Are they straight on to
benefits, is that it? Because a lot

905
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:30.672
benefits, is that it? Because a lot
of peopla are

906
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.672
benefits, is that it? Because a lot
of people are going to struggle. And

907
00:26:32.672 --> 00:26:34.047
of peopla are going to stmggle. And
not just a

908
00:26:34.047 --> 00:26:35.380
of people are going to struggle. And
notjust a small business owners,

909
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:35.588
not just a small business owners,
millions

910
00:26:35.588 --> 00:26:36.505
notjust a small business owners,
millions of self—employed people,

911
00:26:36.505 --> 00:26:36.797
millions of self-employed peopla,
some

912
00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:39.172
millions of self—employed people,
some of them, in our view, not

913
00:26:39.172 --> 00:26:42.213
some of them, in our view, not
genuinely self—employed, some of

914
00:26:42.213 --> 00:26:42.713
genuinely self-employed, some of
them put

915
00:26:42.713 --> 00:26:44.130
genuinely self—employed, some of
them put onto bogus self—employment

916
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:44.380
them put onto bogus self-employment
contracts

917
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.630
them put onto bogus self—employment
contracts precisely to avoid paying

918
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.547
contracts precisely to avoid paying
their basic rights like sick pay.

919
00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:50.963
their basic rights like sick pay.
But the idea that they can survive

920
00:26:50.963 --> 00:26:53.005
But the idea that they ran survive
for a

921
00:26:53.005 --> 00:26:54.838
But the idea that they can survive
for a sustained period on benefits

922
00:26:54.838 --> 00:26:56.380
for a sustained period on benefits
is a real problem. But, you know,

923
00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.505
is a real problem. But, you know,
this is an argument we are making

924
00:26:58.505 --> 00:27:01.422
this is an argument we are making
more broadly in terms of workers.

925
00:27:01.422 --> 00:27:04.130
more broadly in terms of workers.
How do we make sure that we don’t

926
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.505
How do we make sure that we don’t
just bail

927
00:27:04.505 --> 00:27:04.755
How do we make sure that we don’t
just bailout

928
00:27:04.755 --> 00:27:07.463
How do we make sure that we don’t
just bail out the boardrooms? We got

929
00:27:07.463 --> 00:27:08.255
just bailout the boardrooms? We got
to bail

930
00:27:08.255 --> 00:27:08.380
just bailout the boardrooms? We got
to bailout

931
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.213
just bail out the boardrooms? We got
to bail out workers, they got food

932
00:27:09.213 --> 00:27:12.797
to bail out workers, they got food
to put on the table, children to

933
00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:16.338
to put on the table, children to
raise, and statutory sick pay, £91; a

934
00:27:16.338 --> 00:27:18.088
raise, and statutory sick pay, £94 a
week, it is not

935
00:27:18.088 --> 00:27:18.672
raise, and statutory sick pay, £91; a
week, it is not enough. Matt, I

936
00:27:18.672 --> 00:27:20.255
week, it is not enough. Matt, I
think you would be the first on to

937
00:27:20.255 --> 00:27:20.422
think you would be the first on to
55V

938
00:27:20.422 --> 00:27:21.672
think you would be the first on to
say that you couldn’t live on that.

939
00:27:21.672 --> 00:27:25.922
say that you couldn’t live on that.
I don’t think any of us could. Could

940
00:27:25.922 --> 00:27:30.213
I don’t think any of us could. Could
you? No. But you expect others to?

941
00:27:30.213 --> 00:27:30.672
you? No. But you expect others to?
No, I

942
00:27:30.672 --> 00:27:30.963
you? No. But you expect others to?
No, Ithink

943
00:27:30.963 --> 00:27:34.005
you? No. But you expect others to?
No, I think we have got to support

944
00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:35.047
No, I think we have got to support
everybody and support both

945
00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:35.130
everybody and support both
businesses

946
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:35.380
everybody and support both
businesses

947
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.047
everybody and support both
businesses to help support their

948
00:27:37.047 --> 00:27:39.380
businesses to help support their
staff, we want businesses to support

949
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.588
staff, we want businesses to support
their staff because the best

950
00:27:40.588 --> 00:27:41.213
staff, we want businesses to support
their staff because the best thing

951
00:27:41.213 --> 00:27:43.422
their staff because the best thing
is if people stay in employment. You

952
00:27:43.422 --> 00:27:44.713
is if peoplo stay in employment. You
know, this is a

953
00:27:44.713 --> 00:27:46.213
is if people stay in employment. You
know, this is a once in a century

954
00:27:46.213 --> 00:27:50.255
know, this is a once in a century
event... But we know that. We know

955
00:27:50.255 --> 00:27:52.130
event... But we know that. We know
all that, but we had the Prime

956
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.797
all that, but we had the Prime
Minister saying today, businesses,

957
00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:56.088
Minister saying today, businesses,
keep your employees on, support

958
00:27:56.088 --> 00:27:57.463
keep your employees on, support
them, because we are going to

959
00:27:57.463 --> 00:27:58.672
them, because we are going to
support you but you’ve got Angela

960
00:27:58.672 --> 00:28:01.005
support you but you’ve got Angela
here saying I don’t know what is

961
00:28:01.005 --> 00:28:03.213
here saying I don’t know what is
going to happen. I was coming on to

962
00:28:03.213 --> 00:28:04.880
going to happen. I was coming on to
that. This is a once in a century

963
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.797
that. This is a once in a century
event and it means that the whole

964
00:28:06.797 --> 00:28:09.463
event and it means that the whole
resources of the country have got to

965
00:28:09.463 --> 00:28:11.505
resources of the country have got to
be turned on how best we get through

966
00:28:11.505 --> 00:28:13.672
be turned on how best we get through
this as a country. You know, it is

967
00:28:13.672 --> 00:28:15.172
this as a country. You know, it is
because we are all humans that we

968
00:28:15.172 --> 00:28:17.797
because we are all humans that we
are all susceptible to the virus, so

969
00:28:17.797 --> 00:28:19.797
are all susceptible to the virus, so
we need to all come together to

970
00:28:19.797 --> 00:28:22.172
we need to all come together to
support each other through it and

971
00:28:22.172 --> 00:28:24.880
support each other through it and
that, of course, the only

972
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880
that, of course, the only
organisation, the only organisation

973
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.130
organisation, the only organisation
that is big enough to do that in a

974
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.213
that is big enough to do that in a
calamity of this scale is the

975
00:28:30.213 --> 00:28:31.297
calamity of this scale is the
Government, so absolutely we are

976
00:28:31.297 --> 00:28:33.338
Government, so absolutely we are
going to come to the aid of

977
00:28:33.338 --> 00:28:35.255
going to come to the aid of
businesses as fast as we possibly

978
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:35.797
businesses as fast as we possibly
ran, so that

979
00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:36.463
businesses as fast as we possibly
can, so that businesses can keep

980
00:28:36.463 --> 00:28:38.005
ran, so that businesses ran keep
their

981
00:28:38.005 --> 00:28:40.130
can, so that businesses can keep
their staff on, so that you are

982
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.255
their staff on, so that you are
there... Angela has already let hers

983
00:28:41.255 --> 00:28:44.963
there... Angela has already let hers
go. No, she has actually kept them

984
00:28:44.963 --> 00:28:49.255
go. No, she has actually kept them
on, although unpaid for now, so we

985
00:28:49.255 --> 00:28:51.172
on, although unpaid for now, so we
need to come to Angela’s aid,

986
00:28:51.172 --> 00:28:52.922
need to come to Angela’s aid,
because, when this is over, I want

987
00:28:52.922 --> 00:28:55.963
because, when this is over, I want
Angela able to open her restaurants

988
00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:58.797
Angela able to open her restaurants
again. And we have got to look after

989
00:28:58.797 --> 00:28:59.172
again. And we have got to look after
peopla, we’ve

990
00:28:59.172 --> 00:29:00.547
again. And we have got to look after
people, we’ve got to look after

991
00:29:00.547 --> 00:29:01.797
people, we’ve got to look after
businesses, as well as fight the

992
00:29:01.797 --> 00:29:03.463
businesses, as well as fight the
disease and we got to use the whole

993
00:29:03.463 --> 00:29:05.963
disease and we got to use the whole
resources of the state to do this. I

994
00:29:05.963 --> 00:29:07.172
resources of the state to do this. I
have sympathy with what Matty saying

995
00:29:07.172 --> 00:29:08.880
have sympathy with what Matty saying
because if I look back at our

996
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.380
because if I look back at our
experience, we had an economic crash

997
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.630
experience, we had an economic crash
in 2008 and then a health crisis in

998
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.547
in 2008 and then a health crisis in
2009, and now this Government has

999
00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:16.963
2009, and now this Government has
got them together, so I absolutely

1000
00:29:16.963 --> 00:29:18.880
got them together, so I absolutely
do have a lot of sympathy with what

1001
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.588
do have a lot of sympathy with what
being said. However, here is the

1002
00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:24.672
being said. However, here is the
criticism, or the challenge. The

1003
00:29:24.672 --> 00:29:25.922
criticism, or the challenge. The
Government has taken a lot of

1004
00:29:25.922 --> 00:29:28.630
Government has taken a lot of
measures this week that have sounded

1005
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.047
measures this week that have sounded
good but never, not quite given all

1006
00:29:30.047 --> 00:29:31.755
good but never, not quite given all
the answers that people like Angela

1007
00:29:31.755 --> 00:29:32.213
the answers that peopla like Angela
are looking

1008
00:29:32.213 --> 00:29:34.380
the answers that people like Angela
are looking for. But the problem is

1009
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.005
are looking for. But the problem is
the Government has done the least

1010
00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:37.672
the Government has done the least
for the people who need help the

1011
00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:40.755
for the people who need help the
most, and I am talking about people

1012
00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:42.963
most, and I am talking about peopla
in low paid,

1013
00:29:42.963 --> 00:29:44.463
most, and I am talking about people
in low paid, insecure employment,

1014
00:29:44.463 --> 00:29:44.880
in low paid, insecure employment,
peopla who

1015
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.922
in low paid, insecure employment,
people who are self—employed, people

1016
00:29:45.922 --> 00:29:46.255
peopla who are self-employed, peopla
who are

1017
00:29:46.255 --> 00:29:49.380
people who are self—employed, people
who are on benefits already or out

1018
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.880
who are on benefits already or out
of work and the problem, the reason

1019
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.047
of work and the problem, the reason
it is a problem for the Government,

1020
00:29:53.047 --> 00:29:54.547
it is a problem for the Government,
is that those people can’t follow

1021
00:29:54.547 --> 00:29:55.380
is that those peopla ran’t follow
the

1022
00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.255
is that those people can’t follow
the Government’s advice to

1023
00:29:57.255 --> 00:29:58.797
the Government’s advice to
self—isolate, they have to go into

1024
00:29:58.797 --> 00:29:59.255
self-isolate, they have to go into
work and

1025
00:29:59.255 --> 00:30:00.505
self—isolate, they have to go into
work and some of them work in social

1026
00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:01.380
work and some of them work in social
rare. And

1027
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.880
work and some of them work in social
care. And that is not a good thing.

1028
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.422
rare. And that is not a good thing.
So they should

1029
00:30:03.422 --> 00:30:04.380
care. And that is not a good thing.
So they should have been the first

1030
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.630
So they should have been the first
EWUP-

1031
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.672
So they should have been the first
group, I would say, to be helped,

1032
00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:07.922
group, I would say, to be helped,
not the last and the Government

1033
00:30:07.922 --> 00:30:09.880
not the last and the Government
really needs to address this. It is

1034
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.255
really needs to address this. It is
rash

1035
00:30:10.255 --> 00:30:12.255
really needs to address this. It is
cash flow for businesses, let be ——

1036
00:30:12.255 --> 00:30:12.838
rash ﬂow for businesses, let be --
maybe really

1037
00:30:12.838 --> 00:30:15.838
cash flow for businesses, let be ——
maybe really clear about that. The

1038
00:30:15.838 --> 00:30:17.088
maybe really clear about that. The
Chamber of Commerce for Greater

1039
00:30:17.088 --> 00:30:18.713
Chamber of Commerce for Greater
Manchester wanted me to make that

1040
00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:20.047
Manchester wanted me to make that
point, the businesses need money,

1041
00:30:20.047 --> 00:30:21.547
point, the businesses need money,
they needed today but it will have

1042
00:30:21.547 --> 00:30:23.088
they needed today but it will have
to be tomorrow but it should come

1043
00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:25.380
to be tomorrow but it should come
with the condition that the money is

1044
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.672
with the condition that the money is
used to pay staff and keep them on.

1045
00:30:27.672 --> 00:30:29.713
used to pay staff and keep them on.
Gordon Brown was making this point

1046
00:30:29.713 --> 00:30:31.880
Gordon Brown was making this point
incredibly powerfully on the radio

1047
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.088
incredibly powerfuuy on the radio
today,

1048
00:30:32.088 --> 00:30:34.672
incredibly powerfully on the radio
today, because if we keep a like

1049
00:30:34.672 --> 00:30:35.005
today, because if we keep a like
Angela’s a

1050
00:30:35.005 --> 00:30:35.255
today, because if we keep a like
Angela’s afloat

1051
00:30:35.255 --> 00:30:36.047
today, because if we keep a like
Angela’s a float and we keep staff

1052
00:30:36.047 --> 00:30:37.213
Angela’s a ﬂoat and we keep staff
in position,

1053
00:30:37.213 --> 00:30:38.505
Angela’s a float and we keep staff
in position, this is the crucial

1054
00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:40.130
in position, this is the crucial
point, it will help people know to

1055
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.213
point, it will help peopla know to
do the right

1056
00:30:41.213 --> 00:30:43.297
point, it will help people know to
do the right thing and follow the

1057
00:30:43.297 --> 00:30:44.838
do the right thing and follow the
Government’s advice. But, crucially,

1058
00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:46.422
Government’s advice. But, crucially,
it will make the recovery easier

1059
00:30:46.422 --> 00:30:48.255
it will make the recovery easier
after all this is over because we

1060
00:30:48.255 --> 00:30:49.630
after all this is over because we
will have businesses that are there,

1061
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.630
will have businesses that are there,
staff that are there, ready to go

1062
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.047
staff that are there, ready to go
and the Government needs to act on

1063
00:30:54.047 --> 00:30:57.047
and the Government needs to act on
this tomorrow. It needs to increase

1064
00:30:57.047 --> 00:30:59.130
this tomorrow. It needs to increase
statutory sick pay, as you just

1065
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.797
statutory sick pay, as you just
acknowledge yourself. It needs to

1066
00:31:00.797 --> 00:31:02.463
acknowledge yourself. It needs to
remove the restrictions on

1067
00:31:02.463 --> 00:31:04.380
remove the restrictions on
jobseeker’s allowance, increase

1068
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.713
jobseeker’s allowance, increase
Universal Credit, guarantee people’s

1069
00:31:05.713 --> 00:31:08.797
Universal Credit, guarantee people’s
wages with a Government contribution

1070
00:31:08.797 --> 00:31:10.380
wages with a Government contribution
to those wages, help self—employed

1071
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.880
to those wages, help self-employed
peopla more

1072
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.005
to those wages, help self—employed
people more than saying apply for

1073
00:31:12.005 --> 00:31:13.630
people more than saying apply for
Universal Credit. It needs to do all

1074
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.005
Universal Credit. It needs to do all
of these things tomorrow because

1075
00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:17.047
of these things tomorrow because
that is going to help us in the long

1076
00:31:17.047 --> 00:31:17.463
that is going to help us in the long
term recover

1077
00:31:17.463 --> 00:31:17.713
that is going to help us in the long
term recoverfrom

1078
00:31:17.713 --> 00:31:17.880
that is going to help us in the long
term recover from this,

1079
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.338
that is going to help us in the long
term recoverfrom this, not

1080
00:31:18.338 --> 00:31:18.588
that is going to help us in the long
term recoverfrom this, notjust

1081
00:31:18.588 --> 00:31:18.797
that is going to help us in the long
term recover from this, notjust a

1082
00:31:18.797 --> 00:31:18.963
term recover from this, not just a
health

1083
00:31:18.963 --> 00:31:20.797
term recover from this, notjust a
health crisis but the economic

1084
00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:23.172
health crisis but the economic
crisis as well. Let’s just hear

1085

quickly from Caitlin, who works in a

quickly from Caitlin, who works in a
pub here in Weston—super—Mare.

I’v
e

1088
00:31:29.672 --> 00:31:32.255
I’ve been working on a local pub and

1089
00:31:32.255 --> 00:31:32.463
I’ve been working on a [oral pub and
a

1090
00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:33.338
I’ve been working on a local pub and
a zero—hours contract but was

1091
00:31:33.338 --> 00:31:33.755
a zero-hours contract but was
guaranteed a

1092
00:31:33.755 --> 00:31:35.380
a zero—hours contract but was
guaranteed a shift from week to week

1093
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.005
guaranteed a shift from week to week
but since the advice from the Prime

1094
00:31:37.005 --> 00:31:37.963
but since the advice from the Prime
Minister to stop visiting places

1095

Minister to stop visiting places
like pubs are the custom has dried

1096
00:31:40.547 --> 00:31:40.713
like pubs are the custom has dried
“P

up and so have our ships. I’m lucky

1098
00:31:42.838 --> 00:31:45.130
up and so have our ships. I’m lucky
enough to not have any bills to pay

1099
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.130
enough to not have any bills to pay
and no one to depend on the. But

1100
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.422
and no one to depend on the. But
there are many who I know have

1101
00:31:50.422 --> 00:31:52.047
there are many who I know have
children to feed and rent to pay who

1102
00:31:52.047 --> 00:31:53.672
children to feed and rent to pay who
will struggle in the coming weeks.

1103
00:31:53.672 --> 00:31:55.713
will struggle in the coming weeks.
What does the government intend to

1104
00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:56.338
what does the government intend to
do to help

1105
00:31:56.338 --> 00:31:57.088
What does the government intend to
do to help these people? And I’m

1106
00:31:57.088 --> 00:31:59.713
do to help these people? And I’m
getting a lot of messages about

1107
00:31:59.713 --> 00:32:01.588
getting a lot of messages about
that. I know you are Health

Secretary and we expect to hear from

00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:05.713
Secretary and we expect to hear from
the Chancellor tomorrow. But what

lot of peopla are listening in terms
of

1115
00:32:09.547 --> 00:32:11.922
lot of people are listening in terms
of the points that Caitlin has made,

1116
00:32:11.922 --> 00:32:15.463
of the points that Caitlin has made,
Nigel Nate and Andy made about what

1117
00:32:15.463 --> 00:32:16.255
Nigel Nate and Andy made about what
is coming tomorrow? I’d

1118
00:32:16.255 --> 00:32:17.130
is coming tomorrow? I’d
wholeheartedly agree with the

1119
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.505
wholeheartedly agree with the
arguments being put and we are going

1120
00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:24.213
arguments being put and we are going
to deliver on that. The first people

1121
00:32:24.213 --> 00:32:24.463
to deliver on that. The first peopla
who

1122
00:32:24.463 --> 00:32:26.713
to deliver on that. The first people
who we’ve changed the rules to help

1123
00:32:26.713 --> 00:32:27.047
who we’ve changed the mles to help
within

1124
00:32:27.047 --> 00:32:28.338
who we’ve changed the rules to help
within the budget, ten days ago,

1125
00:32:28.338 --> 00:32:30.297
within the budget, ten days ago,
feels like a lifetime ago, to make

1126
00:32:30.297 --> 00:32:34.130
feels like a lifetime ago, to make
sure that people, who were in a

1127
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.505
sure that peopla, who were in a
position of

1128
00:32:34.505 --> 00:32:35.463
sure that people, who were in a
position of working and not getting

1129
00:32:35.463 --> 00:32:37.338
position of working and not getting
statutory sick pay right from the

1130
00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:39.505
statutory sick pay right from the
start, they will get that and we

1131
00:32:39.505 --> 00:32:40.963
start, they will get that and we
published the legislation to make it

1132
00:32:40.963 --> 00:32:43.130
published the legislation to make it
happen today and it is law as of

1133
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.338
happen today and it is law as of
today. Second thing we have to do is

1134
00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:49.088
today. Second thing we have to do is
keep people in work because the best

1135
00:32:49.088 --> 00:32:49.297
keep people in work because the best
“Y

1136
00:32:49.297 --> 00:32:51.130
keep people in work because the best
way to make sure we are ready to

1137
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.880
way to make sure we are ready to
bounce back is to keep people in

1138
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.130
bounce back is to keep people in
their

1139
00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.463
bounce back is to keep people in
theirjobs, even when their

1140
00:32:55.463 --> 00:32:58.755
theirjobs, even when their
businesses are struggling or closed,

1141
00:32:58.755 --> 00:32:59.213
businesses are stmggling or closed,
essentially

1142
00:32:59.213 --> 00:32:59.755
businesses are struggling or closed,
essentially because of decisions

1143
00:32:59.755 --> 00:33:01.255
essentially because of decisions
that the government has had to make

1144
00:33:01.255 --> 00:33:04.547
that the government has had to make
for health reasons. And the third

1145
00:33:04.547 --> 00:33:07.255
for health reasons. And the third
thing is we have to directly help

1146
00:33:07.255 --> 00:33:07.880
thing is we have to directly help
peopla and

1147
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.713
thing is we have to directly help
people and get money into people’s

1148
00:33:08.713 --> 00:33:09.297
peopla and get money into people’s
pockets to

1149
00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:10.547
people and get money into people’s
pockets to help them through this.

1150
00:33:10.547 --> 00:33:11.963
pockets to help them through this.
You have already said you could not

1151
00:33:11.963 --> 00:33:14.422
You have already said you could not
live on a statutory sick pay, it’s

1152
00:33:14.422 --> 00:33:16.338
live on a statutory sick pay, it’s
not enough, so will people get more

1153
00:33:16.338 --> 00:33:16.505
not enough, so will peopla get more
than

1154
00:33:16.505 --> 00:33:18.547
not enough, so will people get more
than that? I’m not going to prejudge

1155
00:33:18.547 --> 00:33:20.130
than that? I’m not going to prejudge
what the Chancellor will say

1156
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.338
what the Chancellor will say
tomorrow but all I can say is mark

1157
00:33:22.338 --> 00:33:22.922
tomorrow but all I ran say is mark
my words, we

1158
00:33:22.922 --> 00:33:24.463
tomorrow but all I can say is mark
my words, we will do everything we

1159
00:33:24.463 --> 00:33:24.838
my words, we will do everything we
ran to

1160
00:33:24.838 --> 00:33:26.672
my words, we will do everything we
can to make sure that people are

1161
00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:26.922
ran to make sure that peopla are
supported

1162
00:33:26.922 --> 00:33:27.963
can to make sure that people are
supported through this. That is the

1163
00:33:27.963 --> 00:33:30.838
supported through this. That is the
only way to deal with a once in a

1164
00:33:30.838 --> 00:33:32.088
only way to deal with a once in a
century event like this because we

1165
00:33:32.088 --> 00:33:33.213
century event like this because we
have to keep the whole public

1166
00:33:33.213 --> 00:33:36.713
have to keep the whole public
together. And it made the point very

1167
00:33:36.713 --> 00:33:39.172
together. And it made the point very
powerfuuy --

1168
00:33:39.172 --> 00:33:40.255
together. And it made the point very
powerfully —— Andy made the point

1169
00:33:40.255 --> 00:33:41.922
powerfuuy -- Andy made the point
point we are

1170
00:33:41.922 --> 00:33:43.588
powerfully —— Andy made the point
point we are asking people to do

1171
00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:44.047
point we are asking peopla to do
incredibly

1172
00:33:44.047 --> 00:33:44.713
point we are asking people to do
incredibly unusual things, for

1173
00:33:44.713 --> 00:33:47.130
incredibly unusual things, for
instance to stay at home and not to

1174
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.588
instance to stay at home and not to
go out. And if they are ill, not to

1175
00:33:49.588 --> 00:33:52.755
go out. And if they are ill, not to
go to work. We have got to make sure

1176
00:33:52.755 --> 00:33:54.505
go to work. We have got to make sure
that they are not penalised for

1177
00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:55.880
that they are not penalised for
doing the right thing because the

1178
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.630
doing the right thing because the
worst thing would be if people go

1179
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:59.088
worst thing would be if peopla go
out and

1180
00:33:59.088 --> 00:34:00.172
worst thing would be if people go
out and spread this virus because

1181
00:34:00.172 --> 00:34:02.130
out and spread this virus because
they are not given the support to

1182
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.755
they are not given the support to
follow the rules we ourselves in

place for health reasons.

Emphatically I am in support of the

1187

Emphatirally I am in support of the
action we

1188

Emphatically I am in support of the
action we have taken, hundreds of

1189
00:34:12.213 --> 00:34:13.797
action we have taken, hundreds of
billions of pounds worth of action,

1190
00:34:13.797 --> 00:34:17.130
billions of pounds worth of action,
and the action that we are

1191
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.422
and the action that we are
finalising the details are. Will

finalising the details are. Will
tomorrow answer all of these things?

tomorrow answer all of these things?
What I felt a little bit at the

1194
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.505
What I felt a little bit at the
moment is that these statements at

1195

moment is that these statements at
the moment are half answering things

the moment are half answering things
are not fully answering. Let me just

are not fully answering. Let me just
read something. In our virtual way

read something. In our virtual way
we want to hear from our audience,

interested in the comparison between
the scientific and health response

the scientific and health response
and the economic response. It seems

1215

and the economic response. It seems

the modelling and the response has

1220

the modelling and the response has
been quick but the economic side, it

1221
00:35:19.422 --> 00:35:21.088
been quick but the economic side, it
seems like we have been caught a bit

1222
00:35:21.088 --> 00:35:22.130
seems like we have been taught a bit
on the hop and

1223
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.755
seems like we have been caught a bit
on the hop and having to make

1224
00:35:22.755 --> 00:35:24.880
on the hop and having to make
statements and try to fill in

1225
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.880
statements and try to fill in
details afterwards. I wondered, you

1226
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.505
details afterwards. Iwondered, you
have said

1227
00:35:27.505 --> 00:35:29.047
details afterwards. I wondered, you
have said it is a once in a century

1228
00:35:29.047 --> 00:35:31.755
have said it is a once in a century
event, it is that health event as

1229
00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:34.505
event, it is that health event as
well as an economic event now. If

1230
00:35:34.505 --> 00:35:36.505
well as an economic event now. If
you compare them, do you feel that

1231
00:35:36.505 --> 00:35:38.130
you compare them, do you feel that
on the economic side of things are a

1232
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.588
on the economic side of things are a
bit lacking or have people been

1233
00:35:39.588 --> 00:35:39.755
bit lacking or have peopla been
taught

1234
00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:39.963
bit lacking or have peopla been
caught out

1235
00:35:39.963 --> 00:35:42.880
bit lacking or have people been
caught out by it? No, I think the

1236
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.338
caught out by it? No, I think the
response on the economic side by the

1237
00:35:44.338 --> 00:35:47.255
response on the economic side by the
Chancellor has been unbelievably

1238
00:35:47.255 --> 00:35:51.338
Chancellor has been unbelievably
fast considering the scale of the

1239
00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:52.922
fast considering the scale of the
economic consequences of the health

1240
00:35:52.922 --> 00:35:57.255
economic consequences of the health
decisions we have had to make. But

1241
00:35:57.255 --> 00:35:58.963
decisions we have had to make. But
in government, having to take the

1242
00:35:58.963 --> 00:36:00.463
in government, having to take the
decisions of the scale that we have

1243
00:36:00.463 --> 00:36:03.255
decisions of the scale that we have
over the past two weeks it has been

1244
00:36:03.255 --> 00:36:06.130
over the past two weeks it has been
extraordinary. And of course the

1245
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.130
extraordinary. And of course the
hard question is, how do we turn a

1246
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.547
hard question is, how do we turn a
decision at one of those podiums in

1247
00:36:10.547 --> 00:36:13.380
decision at one of those podiums in
Downing Street into real cash going

1248
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:13.505
Downing Street into real rash going
into

1249
00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:17.255
Downing Street into real cash going
into people’s pockets. You see other

1250
00:36:17.255 --> 00:36:19.088
into people’s pockets. You see other
countries who are behind us in terms

1251
00:36:19.088 --> 00:36:21.213
countries who are behind us in terms
of the number of deaths but are

1252
00:36:21.213 --> 00:36:25.088
of the number of deaths but are
doing more to help workers, paying

1253
00:36:25.088 --> 00:36:28.963
doing more to help workers, paying
75% of their wages so that they can

1254
00:36:28.963 --> 00:36:29.672
7596 of their wages so that they ran
not be

1255
00:36:29.672 --> 00:36:35.172
75% of their wages so that they can
not be stuck on a small wage. We did

1256
00:36:35.172 --> 00:36:37.172
not be stuck on a small wage. We did
something this week with mortgage

1257
00:36:37.172 --> 00:36:39.213
something this week with mortgage
holidays. That might benefit people

1258
00:36:39.213 --> 00:36:39.672
holidays. That might benefit peopla
but it

1259
00:36:39.672 --> 00:36:41.130
holidays. That might benefit people
but it will also benefit landlords

1260
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.630
but it will also benefit landlords
when the priority should have been

1261
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.880
when the priority should have been
renters, they should have been the

1262
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.505
renters, they should have been the
first priority. We have got to do

1263
00:36:46.505 --> 00:36:49.130
first priority. We have got to do
all these things. It’s not

1264
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.713
first priority. We have got to do
all these things. It’s notjust Pace

1265
00:36:49.713 --> 00:36:50.297
all these things. It’s not just Pace
but who you

1266
00:36:50.297 --> 00:36:51.130
all these things. It’s notjust Pace
but who you prioritise first, and

1267
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.880
but who you prioritise first, and
the point you agreed with a moment

1268
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.130
the point you agreed with a moment
ago, help the people who cannot

1269
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.297
ago, help the peopla who cannot
afford...

1270
00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:57.755
ago, help the people who cannot
afford... If they don’t get help,

1271
00:36:57.755 --> 00:36:59.963
afford... If they don’t get help,
they can’t follow the advice. The

1272
00:36:59.963 --> 00:37:01.713
they can’t follow the advice. The
prioritisation has to be a little

1273
00:37:01.713 --> 00:37:03.297
prioritisation has to be a little
more in tune with the level of need.

1274
00:37:03.297 --> 00:37:05.130
more in tune with the level of need.
Is the first people who we helped

1275
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.672
Is the first people who we helped
were people who otherwise would not

1276
00:37:06.672 --> 00:37:09.630
were people who otherwise would not
have got a statutory sick pay. Must

1277
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.672
have got a statutory sick pay. Must
say, on the question itself, if you

1278
00:37:11.672 --> 00:37:12.213
say, on the question itself, if you
are regularty

1279
00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:14.130
say, on the question itself, if you
are regularly getting hours on a

1280
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.797
are regularly getting hours on a
zero—hours contract, you are

1281
00:37:15.797 --> 00:37:16.213
zero-hours contract, you are
eligibla for

1282
00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:17.213
zero—hours contract, you are
eligible for statutory sick pay and

1283
00:37:17.213 --> 00:37:17.505
eligibla for statutory sick pay and
it’s

1284
00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:17.713
eligibla for stamtory sick pay and
it’s illegal

1285
00:37:17.713 --> 00:37:21.213
eligible for statutory sick pay and
it’s illegal not to pay it. Let’s be

1286
00:37:21.213 --> 00:37:23.963
it’s illegal not to pay it. Let’s be
honest, there are 2 million people

1287
00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:25.338
honest, there are 2 million people
in this country who don’t earn

1288
00:37:25.338 --> 00:37:28.130
in this country who don’t earn
enough to qualify for statutory sick

they’ re currently

they’re currently being offered, if

1294
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.422
therre currently being offered, if
they need to

1295
00:37:34.422 --> 00:37:35.422
they’re currently being offered, if
they need to self—isolate or they

1296
00:37:35.422 --> 00:37:36.130
they need to self-isolate or they
are sick, they

1297
00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.213
they need to self—isolate or they
are sick, they are offered benefits.

1298
00:37:38.213 --> 00:37:41.463
are sick, they are offered benefits.
Let’s be frank about that one. I

1299
00:37:41.463 --> 00:37:43.630
Let’s be frank about that one. I
think what we all have to play our

1300
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.047
think what we all have to play our
part with,

1301
00:37:44.047 --> 00:37:44.255
think what we all have to play our
mummJ

1302
00:37:44.255 --> 00:37:45.255
think what we all have to play our
part with, I met the Chancellor

1303
00:37:45.255 --> 00:37:49.922
part with, I met the Chancellor
today to discuss exactly this issue

1304
00:37:49.922 --> 00:37:52.630
today to discuss exactly this issue
that we know, in Denmark and Germany

1305
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:56.255
that we know, in Denmark and Germany
and Sweden, we have these schemes

1306
00:37:56.255 --> 00:37:58.005
and Sweden, we have these schemes
that do put money directly into the

1307
00:37:58.005 --> 00:38:01.588
that do put money directly into the
pockets of workers. 50 that an

1308
00:38:01.588 --> 00:38:01.755
pockets of workers. So that an
employer

1309
00:38:01.755 --> 00:38:02.005
pockets of workers. 50 that an
employer who

1310
00:38:02.005 --> 00:38:04.088
pockets of workers. So that an
employer who otherwise might be

1311
00:38:04.088 --> 00:38:05.463
employer who otherwise might be
thinking, because the credit

1312
00:38:05.463 --> 00:38:08.963
thinking, because the credit
facility will not help every

1313
00:38:08.963 --> 00:38:10.005
facility will not help every
business, there are some significant

1314
00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:12.255
business, there are some significant
businesses that we know, our

1315
00:38:12.255 --> 00:38:14.713
businesses that we know, our
officers on the ground negotiating

1316
00:38:14.713 --> 00:38:16.338
officers on the ground negotiating
and coming to agreements with those

1317
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:18.130
and coming to agreements with those
businesses, they know they are in

1318
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.338
businesses, they know they are in
trouble. We know some big decisions

1319
00:38:20.338 --> 00:38:20.672
troubla. We know some big decisions
will be

1320
00:38:20.672 --> 00:38:21.713
trouble. We know some big decisions
will be taken over the next 48

1321
00:38:21.713 --> 00:38:27.297
will be taken over the next 48
hours. And I welcomed the efforts to

1322
00:38:27.297 --> 00:38:32.130
hours. And I welcomed the efforts to
look at bringing in a scheme that

1323
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.213
look at bringing in a scheme that
will replace incomes, provide that

1324
00:38:33.213 --> 00:38:37.047
will replace incomes, provide that
kind of 75% 25% possibly on a very

1325
00:38:37.047 --> 00:38:39.130
kind of 7596 2596 possibly on a very
big salt. But

1326
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.088
kind of 75% 25% possibly on a very
big scale. But we have to get the

1327
00:38:40.088 --> 00:38:40.713
big stale. But we have to get the
delivery and I

1328
00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:43.880
big scale. But we have to get the
delivery and I do agree that every

1329
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.505
delivery and I do agree that every
day counts at the moment. Our people

1330
00:38:46.505 --> 00:38:46.630
day counts at the moment. Our peopla
are

1331
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.297
day counts at the moment. Our people
are dealing with redundancies,

1332
00:38:48.297 --> 00:38:48.505
are dealing with redundancies,
lay-offs,

1333
00:38:48.505 --> 00:38:49.922
are dealing with redundancies,
lay—offs, short time working and you

1334
00:38:49.922 --> 00:38:51.297
lay-offs, short time working and you
are quite right,

1335
00:38:51.297 --> 00:38:53.130
lay—offs, short time working and you
are quite right, Matt, that when we

1336
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.255
are quite right, Matt, that when we
get through this, which we must, we

1337
00:38:55.255 --> 00:38:56.463
get through this, which we must, we
have got to have decent

1338
00:38:56.463 --> 00:38:56.922
get through this, which we must, we
have got to have decentjobs for

1339
00:38:56.922 --> 00:38:57.255
have got to have decent jobs for
peopla to

1340
00:38:57.255 --> 00:39:00.547
have got to have decentjobs for
people to hold onto, to grow our

1341
00:39:00.547 --> 00:39:00.880
peopla to hold onto, to grow our
economy so

1342
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.713
people to hold onto, to grow our
economy so that all of us will

1343
00:39:02.713 --> 00:39:04.338
economy so that all of us will
benefit and we fund our public

1344
00:39:04.338 --> 00:39:07.088
benefit and we fund our public
services. That is what Gordon Brown

1345
00:39:07.088 --> 00:39:08.713
services. That is what Gordon Brown
spoke about, two waves of

1346
00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.255
spoke about, two waves of
unemployment. We are seeing the

1347
00:39:10.255 --> 00:39:10.922
unemployment. We are seeing the
first now

1348
00:39:10.922 --> 00:39:12.130
unemployment. We are seeing the
first new and this will cause a

1349
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.297
first now and this will cause a
second

1350
00:39:12.297 --> 00:39:16.088
first new and this will cause a
second wave of unemployment. For me

1351
00:39:16.088 --> 00:39:17.505
second wave of unemployment. For me
it is putting people on unpaid

1352
00:39:17.505 --> 00:39:17.713
it is putting peopla on unpaid
leave,

1353
00:39:17.713 --> 00:39:19.547
it is putting people on unpaid
leave, they can’t afford to go to

1354
00:39:19.547 --> 00:39:22.005
leave, they can’t afford to go to
the shop, buy clothes... And there

1355
00:39:22.005 --> 00:39:24.047
the shop, buy clothes... And there
has to be a transition in there as

1356
00:39:24.047 --> 00:39:27.047
has to be a transition in there as
well, it has to be jobs and fair

1357
00:39:27.047 --> 00:39:28.963
well, it has to be jobs and fair
wages. Exactly. We have quite a few

1358
00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:30.130
wages. Exactly. We have quite a few
pressures to get through.

1359

collect prescriptions and food

1379
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.213
collect prescriptions and food
because pharmacies can no longer

because pharmacies ran no longer
take on

1381
00:39:56.922 --> 00:39:58.505
because pharmacies can no longer
take on home deliveries and there

1382
00:39:58.505 --> 00:40:00.672
take on home deliveries and there
was a three—week wait for online

1383
00:40:00.672 --> 00:40:01.047
was a three-week wait for online
supermarket

1384
00:40:01.047 --> 00:40:02.922
was a three—week wait for online
supermarket deliveries. My question

1385
00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:05.672
supermarket deliveries. My question
is, how do I balance the risks

1386
00:40:05.672 --> 00:40:08.130
is, how do I balance the risks
between collecting medication and

1387
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:08.297
between collecting meditation and
food

1388
00:40:08.297 --> 00:40:09.672
between collecting medication and
food and potentially spreading the

1389
00:40:09.672 --> 00:40:11.713
food and potentially spreading the
virus, and how do we ramp up

1390

virus, and how do we ramp up
capacity to meet the demands on

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:15.297
capacity to meet the demands on
rarers,

1392

capacity to meet the demands on
carers, pharmacies and supermarket

and it’s a

1411
00:40:39.713 --> 00:40:40.130
food?" Tom? This is happening now
and it’s a desperately sad

1412
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.630
and it’s a desperately sad
situation. The only positive thing,

1413
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.338
situation. The only positive thing,
one of the positives from this

1414
00:40:45.338 --> 00:40:47.130
one of the positives from this
crisis is that we are seeing these

1415
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.838
crisis is that we are seeing these
community groups cropping up all

1416
00:40:48.838 --> 00:40:51.338
community groups cropping up all
over the place. We are seeing

1417
00:40:51.338 --> 00:40:52.755
over the place. We are seeing
younger healthy people volunteering.

1418
00:40:52.755 --> 00:40:54.922
younger healthy people volunteering.
One of my daughters is saying she is

1419
00:40:54.922 --> 00:40:56.713
One of my daughters is saying she is
going to help people locally. In

1420
00:40:56.713 --> 00:40:57.130
going to help peopla locally. In
this

1421
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.172
going to help people locally. In
this kind of situation, if we can

1422
00:40:59.172 --> 00:40:59.547
this kind of situation, if we ran
put peopla

1423
00:40:59.547 --> 00:41:00.630
this kind of situation, if we can
put people together with those not

1424
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.338
put people together with those not
add so much risk if they do the

1425
00:41:04.338 --> 00:41:06.130
add so much risk if they do the
shopping, younger people, teenagers,

1426
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.547
shopping, younger people, teenagers,
adults at less risk, that might be

1427
00:41:07.547 --> 00:41:10.505
adults at lass risk, that might be
one way. It is

1428
00:41:10.505 --> 00:41:10.755
adults at less risk, that might be
one way. It is clearly

1429
00:41:10.755 --> 00:41:11.130
adults at less risk, that might be
one way. It is clearlyJohn who

1430
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:11.547
one way. It is dearty john who
needs help

1431
00:41:11.547 --> 00:41:13.005
one way. It is clearlyJohn who
needs help right now. Where is he in

1432
00:41:13.005 --> 00:41:14.130
needs help right now. where is he in
the country? I

1433
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:15.255
needs help right now. Where is he in
the country? I can’t tell you at the

1434
00:41:15.255 --> 00:41:19.338
the country? I can’t tell you at the
moment. But it has been a fantastic

1435
00:41:19.338 --> 00:41:20.797
moment. But it has been a fantastic
response in many parts of the

1436
00:41:20.797 --> 00:41:21.922
response in many parts of the
country, people coming together to

1437
00:41:21.922 --> 00:41:23.255
country, peopla coming together to
help but it’s

1438
00:41:23.255 --> 00:41:26.088
country, people coming together to
help but it’s obviously not ideal.

1439
00:41:26.088 --> 00:41:27.672
help but it’s obviously not ideal.
But we are in a crisis situation

1440
00:41:27.672 --> 00:41:29.713
But we are in a crisis situation
where we have to use different

1441
00:41:29.713 --> 00:41:31.463
where we have to use different
approaches to sort out problems. In

1442
00:41:31.463 --> 00:41:32.130
approaches to sort out problams. In
terms of

1443
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:33.255
approaches to sort out problems. In
terms of what Jacqueline is the

1444
00:41:33.255 --> 00:41:34.172
terms of what jacqueline is the
same,

1445
00:41:34.172 --> 00:41:35.005
terms of what Jacqueline is the
same, balancing the risks between

1446
00:41:35.005 --> 00:41:37.130
same, balancing the risks between
collecting medication and food and

1447
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.630
collecting meditation and food and
potentially

1448
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.338
collecting medication and food and
potentially spreading the virus...

1449
00:41:41.338 --> 00:41:43.255
potentially spreading the virus...
She has to get her medicine. She is

1450
00:41:43.255 --> 00:41:45.255
She has to get her medicine. She is
wondering how to balance the risk.

1451
00:41:45.255 --> 00:41:47.130
wondering how to balance the risk.
It is tough and you have to feel for

1452
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:50.713
It is tough and you have to feel for
somebody in her position. Tom said,

1453
00:41:50.713 --> 00:41:53.130
somebody in her position. Tom said,
there are so much good things

1454
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.297
there are so much good things
happening to focus on the positives

1455
00:41:54.297 --> 00:41:55.713
happening to focus on the positives
for a minute, there are seven great

1456
00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.713
for a minute, there are seven great
things about the country, people

1457
00:41:57.713 --> 00:41:57.797
things about the country, peopla
stepping

1458
00:41:57.797 --> 00:41:59.672
things about the country, people
stepping forward at a moment like

1459
00:41:59.672 --> 00:42:00.713
stepping forward at a moment like
this -- so many

1460
00:42:00.713 --> 00:42:01.338
stepping forward at a moment like
this —— so many great things pundit

1461
00:42:01.338 --> 00:42:02.130
this -- so many great things pundit
Gary Neville

1462
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:02.713
this —— so many great things pundit
Gary Neville made his hotels

1463
00:42:02.713 --> 00:42:04.547
Gary Neville made his hotels
available to the country. It is

1464
00:42:04.547 --> 00:42:06.088
available to the country. It is
great when you see what people are

1465
00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:07.963
great when you see what people are
prepared to do but more help is

1466
00:42:07.963 --> 00:42:10.088
prepared to do but more help is
needed. This is where somebody in my

1467
00:42:10.088 --> 00:42:12.963
needed. This is where somebody in my
position comes in because we can

1468
00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:13.297
position comes in because we ran
create a

1469
00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.297
position comes in because we can
create a people support system for

1470
00:42:15.297 --> 00:42:17.130
create a people support system for
this crisis. The committee I

1471
00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.005
this crisis. The committee I
mentioned before, we met yesterday

1472
00:42:19.005 --> 00:42:20.755
mentioned before, we met yesterday
and the suggestion is that we might

1473
00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:23.922
and the suggestion is that we might
ask the Fire service in Greater

1474
00:42:23.922 --> 00:42:25.505
ask the Fire service in Greater
Manchester to start ringing people

1475
00:42:25.505 --> 00:42:25.880
Manchester to start ringing peopla
in that

1476
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.713
Manchester to start ringing people
in that position to say, what you

1477
00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:30.130
in that position to say, what you
need, what can be done? We have

1478
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:30.672
need, what ran be done? We have
launched a

1479
00:42:30.672 --> 00:42:31.380
need, what can be done? We have
launched a website to mobilise

1480
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.297
launched a website to mobilise
volunteers. It is not finished yet

1481
00:42:33.297 --> 00:42:35.922
volunteers. It is not finished yet
but we are trying to build eight new

1482
00:42:35.922 --> 00:42:37.463
but we are trying to build eight new
support system where we use all of

1483
00:42:37.463 --> 00:42:39.588
support system where we use all of
the capacity we have got put the

1484
00:42:39.588 --> 00:42:41.005
the capacity we have got put the
Royal Mail in parts of Greater

1485
00:42:41.005 --> 00:42:42.838
Royal Mail in parts of Greater
Manchester offered to do some home

1486
00:42:42.838 --> 00:42:45.130
Manchester offered to do some home
deliveries of items. It is coming

1487
00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.797
deliveries of items. It is coming
together. We can’t leave it all to

1488
00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.838
together. We can’t leave it all to
be spontaneous and groups doing this

1489
00:42:48.838 --> 00:42:50.463
be spontaneous and groups doing this
and that, we are trying to create a

1490
00:42:50.463 --> 00:42:50.588
and that, we are trying to create a
stmcture

1491
00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:52.130
and that, we are trying to create a
structure through which it can

1492
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.755
stmcture through which it ran
happen. I

1493
00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:54.880
structure through which it can
happen. I hope next week we should

1494
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.588
happen. I hope next week we should
be able to have that beginning to

1495
00:42:56.588 --> 00:42:59.255
be able to have that beginning to
work. Angela? I

1496

work. Angela? Ithink

1497
00:42:59.463 --> 00:43:00.088
be able to have that beginning to
work. Angela? I think a lot of

1498
00:43:00.088 --> 00:43:00.422
work. Angela? I think a lot of
peopla have

1499
00:43:00.422 --> 00:43:02.922
work. Angela? I think a lot of
people have done very much the same,

1500
00:43:02.922 --> 00:43:06.297
people have done very much the same,
there are WhatsApp groups in our

1501
00:43:06.297 --> 00:43:08.338
there are WhatsApp groups in our
neighbourhood and we can boast with

1502
00:43:08.338 --> 00:43:08.755

people who will get deliveries from

1509
00:43:14.588 --> 00:43:16.172
people who will get deliveries from
about neighbours who can pick up

1510
00:43:16.172 --> 00:43:18.755
about neighbours who can pick up
medicine. And it has to be that

1511
00:43:18.755 --> 00:43:20.672
medicine. And it has to be that
community spirit. If there are

1512
00:43:20.672 --> 00:43:22.255
community spirit. If there are
initiatives from local councils to

1513
00:43:22.255 --> 00:43:22.463
initiatives from [oral councils to
start

1514
00:43:22.463 --> 00:43:23.880
initiatives from local councils to
start with. ..

1515
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.130
initiatives from local councils to
start with... We have talked about

1516
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.005
start with... We have talked about
rash ﬂow

1517
00:43:26.005 --> 00:43:28.005
start with... We have talked about
cash flow for businesses, how about

1518
00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:28.172
rash ﬂow for businesses, how about
for

1519
00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.338
cash flow for businesses, how about
for councils? I know it’s not

1520
00:43:29.338 --> 00:43:32.755
for councils? I know it’s not
popular but it needs to be said.

1521
00:43:32.755 --> 00:43:33.130
popular but it needs to be said.
More new

1522
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.380
popular but it needs to be said.
More now than I used to see it! They

1523
00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.172
More now than I used to see it! They
need more support to do this.

1524
00:43:38.172 --> 00:43:40.130
need more support to do this.
Doesn’t it bring up the best and

1525
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:43.838
Doesn’t it bring up the best and
worst in people if we are honest? I

1526
00:43:43.838 --> 00:43:44.213
worst in peopla if we are honest? I
think actually

1527
00:43:44.213 --> 00:43:45.838
worst in people if we are honest? I
think actually at the Royal Mail

1528
00:43:45.838 --> 00:43:48.672
think actually at the Royal Mail
initiative, it is the postal

1529
00:43:48.672 --> 00:43:50.005
initiative, it is the postal
worker’s union who put up that

1530
00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:52.088
worker’s union who put up that
proposition pulled up they want to

1531
00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:54.797
proposition pulled up they want to
play a part. But don’t we have to

1532
00:43:54.797 --> 00:43:56.172
play a part. But don’t we have to
hold a mirror up to ourselves

1533
00:43:56.172 --> 00:43:58.255
hold a mirror up to ourselves
because when I look at some of those

1534
00:43:58.255 --> 00:44:01.005
because when I look at some of those
supermarket shelves, people sweeping

1535
00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:01.130
supermarket shelves, people sweeping
“P

1536
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.297
supermarket shelves, people sweeping
up toilet rolls and soap, all the

1537
00:44:03.297 --> 00:44:06.380
up toilet rolls and soap, all the
rest of it, disinfectant, it was

1538
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.713
rest of it, disinfectant, it was
almost like survival of the fittest.

1539
00:44:08.713 --> 00:44:12.547
almost like survival of the fittest.
I do understand, when we are scared,

1540
00:44:12.547 --> 00:44:14.463
I do understand, when we are scared,
often we think about our families

1541
00:44:14.463 --> 00:44:16.755
often we think about our families
first. But don’t we also as a

1542
00:44:16.755 --> 00:44:19.713
first. But don’t we also as a
community have to think about our

1543
00:44:19.713 --> 00:44:21.922
community have to think about our
neighbours, workmates, the elderly

1544
00:44:21.922 --> 00:44:22.172
neighbours, workmates, the elderty
and

1545
00:44:22.172 --> 00:44:23.172
neighbours, workmates, the elderly
and vulnerable? And start getting

1546
00:44:23.172 --> 00:44:25.005
and vulnerable? And start getting
our heads screwed on about our

1547
00:44:25.005 --> 00:44:27.338
our heads screwed on about our
values in this country. How have we

1548
00:44:27.338 --> 00:44:30.130
values in this country. How have we
got here? Last time you are on, you

1549
00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.130
got here? Last time you are on, you
said you were working with

1550
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:32.422
said you were working with
supermarkets to make sure it people

1551
00:44:32.422 --> 00:44:32.547
supermarkets to make sure it people
self-isolating

1552
00:44:32.547 --> 00:44:33.547
supermarkets to make sure it people
self—isolating they will be able to

1553
00:44:33.547 --> 00:44:33.963
self-isolating they will be able to
get food

1554
00:44:33.963 --> 00:44:36.047
self—isolating they will be able to
get food supplies. As you will know,

1555
00:44:36.047 --> 00:44:38.672
get food supplies. As you will know,
a lot of supermarket have said he’s

1556
00:44:38.672 --> 00:44:40.588
a lot of supermarket have said he’s
not talking to us so I’m not sure

1557
00:44:40.588 --> 00:44:42.505
not talking to us so I’m not sure
who you meant. We were talking to

1558
00:44:42.505 --> 00:44:46.005
who you meant. We were talking to
the supermarkets. One supermarket

1559
00:44:46.005 --> 00:44:47.755
the supermarkets. One supermarket
executive said they weren’t. There

1560
00:44:47.755 --> 00:44:52.547
executive said they weren’t. There
was more than one. If we have a

1561
00:44:52.547 --> 00:44:53.713
was more than one. If we have a
situation where someone like

1562
00:44:53.713 --> 00:44:54.005
was more than one. If we have a
situation where someone likeJohn

1563
00:44:54.005 --> 00:44:54.588
situation where someone like john
cannot get an

1564
00:44:54.588 --> 00:44:56.047
situation where someone likeJohn
cannot get an online shop until the

1565
00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:59.463
cannot get an online shop until the
29th of March... Said two weeks ago

1566
00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:01.922
29th of March... Said two weeks ago
was accurate. The supermarkets I

1567
00:45:01.922 --> 00:45:03.630
was accurate. The supermarkets I
think are rising to this. They are

1568
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:07.172
think are rising to this. They are
not the only part of the answer. For

1569
00:45:07.172 --> 00:45:09.463
not the only part of the answer. For
instance, Iceland were the first to

1570
00:45:09.463 --> 00:45:11.130
instance, Iceland were the first to
introduce a silver hour at the start

1571
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.922
introduce a silver hour at the start
of the day so that people could go

1572
00:45:13.922 --> 00:45:14.255
of the day so that peopla could go
to the

1573
00:45:14.255 --> 00:45:17.338
of the day so that people could go
to the supermarket, when the shells

1574
00:45:17.338 --> 00:45:19.255
to the supermarket, when the shells
had been stacked overnight, if they

1575
00:45:19.255 --> 00:45:24.588
had been stacked overnight, if they
were over 70. Keep two metres or six

1576
00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.172
were over 70. Keep two metres or six
feet from other people and stay

1577
00:45:26.172 --> 00:45:29.922
feet from other people and stay
safe, and get their supplies. And I

1578
00:45:29.922 --> 00:45:32.713
safe, and get their supplies. And I
think that sort of measure from the

1579
00:45:32.713 --> 00:45:34.422
think that sort of measure from the
supermarket is important. It is

1580
00:45:34.422 --> 00:45:36.422
supermarket is important. It is
really important to say on public

1581
00:45:36.422 --> 00:45:38.380
really important to say on public
health grounds, you must go out and

1582
00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.922
health grounds, you must go out and
get your medicines and get food,

1583
00:45:40.922 --> 00:45:42.255
get your medicines and get food,
just stay away from other people as

1584
00:45:42.255 --> 00:45:42.838
just stay away from other peopla as
much as you

1585
00:45:42.838 --> 00:45:47.922
just stay away from other people as
much as you can.

1586
00:45:47.922 --> 00:45:51.838
There is a broader point, Andy,
which is, yes, we are putting money

1587
00:45:51.838 --> 00:45:57.797
which is, yes, we are putting money
into councils, we put £1.6 billion

1588
00:45:57.797 --> 00:45:59.130
into councils, we put £1.6 billion
in today and, yes, the councils,

1589
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.380
in today and, yes, the councils,
this is a moment for councils to

1590
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.713
this is a moment for councils to
really rise, just as you are doing

1591
00:46:04.713 --> 00:46:06.255
really rise, just as you are doing
in Manchester as the organising

1592
00:46:06.255 --> 00:46:08.922
in Manchester as the organising
group. But there is also something

1593
00:46:08.922 --> 00:46:10.797
group. But there is also something
everybody can do. Not only following

1594
00:46:10.797 --> 00:46:11.130
everybody ran do. Not only following
the

1595
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.880
everybody can do. Not only following
the rules in terms of self

1596
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.213
the mles in terms of self
isolation,

1597
00:46:13.213 --> 00:46:13.963
the rules in terms of self
isolation, but if every single

1598
00:46:13.963 --> 00:46:18.672
isolation, but if every single
person who is fit and healthy checks

1599
00:46:18.672 --> 00:46:19.963
person who is fit and healthy checks
the door on their left and checks

1600
00:46:19.963 --> 00:46:21.797
the door on their left and checks
the door on their right and over the

1601
00:46:21.797 --> 00:46:24.255
the door on their right and over the
road and does it in a respectful,

1602
00:46:24.255 --> 00:46:27.963
road and does it in a respectful,
community minded way, then we will

1603
00:46:27.963 --> 00:46:29.630
community minded way, then we will
find help for lots of people. So

1604
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.713
find help for lots of peopla. So
yes,

1605
00:46:29.713 --> 00:46:31.630
find help for lots of people. So
yes, there is a role for Government,

1606
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.088
yes, there is a role for Government,
a role for charities and councils,

1607
00:46:33.088 --> 00:46:33.255
a rolc for charities and councils,
but

1608
00:46:33.255 --> 00:46:35.797
a role for charities and councils,
but everybody can play a part in

1609
00:46:35.797 --> 00:46:36.297
but everybody ran play a part in
this. just

1610
00:46:36.297 --> 00:46:37.547
but everybody can play a part in
this. Just keeping you on

1611
00:46:37.547 --> 00:46:39.297
this. Just keeping you on
supermarkets for a minute, since

1612
00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:41.047
supermarkets for a minute, since
that was the question there, some

1613
00:46:41.047 --> 00:46:42.380
that was the question there, some
supermarkets are making their own

1614
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.380
supermarkets are making their own
decision to have, as you say, the

1615
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.213
decision to have, as you say, the
special hour when the elderly can go

1616
00:46:46.213 --> 00:46:47.713
special hour when the elderty ran go
in or they say

1617
00:46:47.713 --> 00:46:49.338
special hour when the elderly can go
in or they say you can only buy four

1618
00:46:49.338 --> 00:46:50.380
in or they say you ran only buy four
or two of

1619
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.172
in or they say you can only buy four
or two of something. You’re leaving

1620
00:46:51.172 --> 00:46:52.672
or two of something. You’re leaving
it up to them. You don’t think there

1621
00:46:52.672 --> 00:46:54.547
it up to them. You don’t think there
is a role for Government to be

1622
00:46:54.547 --> 00:46:55.130
is a rola for Government to be
saying you ran

1623
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.922
is a role for Government to be
saying you can only sell this much

1624
00:46:56.922 --> 00:46:57.963
saying you ran only sell this much
to one person

1625
00:46:57.963 --> 00:46:58.963
saying you can only sell this much
to one person at a time? You are

1626
00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:00.588
to one person at a time? You are
happy to live it up to them, even

1627
00:47:00.588 --> 00:47:01.672
happy to live it up to them, even
though we have a situation where

1628
00:47:01.672 --> 00:47:03.130
though we have a situation where
peopla can’t

1629
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.922
though we have a situation where
people can’t get an online delivery?

1630
00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.963
people can’t get an online delivery?
We have been working with

1631
00:47:06.963 --> 00:47:09.005
We have been working with
supermarkets for many weeks to

1632
00:47:09.005 --> 00:47:10.297
supermarkets for many weeks to
prepare in this eventuality. That

1633
00:47:10.297 --> 00:47:12.505
prepare in this eventuality. That
work had been going on and was why I

1634
00:47:12.505 --> 00:47:17.380
work had been going on and was why I
talked about it last time, and it is

1635
00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.338
talked about it last time, and it is
absolutely... It got to be this sort

1636
00:47:19.338 --> 00:47:21.463
absolutely... It got to be this sort
of measures to stop this mass spying

1637
00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:24.255
of measures to stop this mass spying
have got to be increased. Can I make

1638
00:47:24.255 --> 00:47:24.547
have got to be increased. (“an I make
a

1639
00:47:24.547 --> 00:47:25.380
have got to be increased. Can I make
a constructive suggestion? I think

1640
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.088
a constructive suggestion? I think
you need to give councils an ability

1641
00:47:28.088 --> 00:47:30.005
you need to give councils an ability
to go to the front of the queue with

1642
00:47:30.005 --> 00:47:30.422
to go to the front of the queue with
people like

1643
00:47:30.422 --> 00:47:31.380
to go to the front of the queue with
people likeJohn, who needs to get

1644
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.088
people like john, who needs to get
to the

1645
00:47:32.088 --> 00:47:35.880
people likeJohn, who needs to get
to the front of the queue. I was

1646
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.922
to the front of the queue. I was
told today somebody who has cystic

1647
00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:39.797
told today somebody who has cystic
fibrosis, I think late 20s or 30s,

1648
00:47:39.797 --> 00:47:41.130
fibrosis, I think late 205 or 305,
who doesn’t have the ability to get

1649
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:44.130
who doesn’t have the ability to get
out because of the risk, three or

1650
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.338
out because of the risk, three or
four weeks having to wait to get

1651
00:47:46.338 --> 00:47:48.922
four weeks having to wait to get
food, so there needs to be an

1652
00:47:48.922 --> 00:47:49.880
food, so there needs to be an
arrangement whereby councils, for

1653
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.797
arrangement whereby councils, for
people who they are acting for, can

1654
00:47:51.797 --> 00:47:52.547
peopla who they are acting for, ran
go to the front

1655
00:47:52.547 --> 00:47:53.588
people who they are acting for, can
go to the front of the queue and I

1656
00:47:53.588 --> 00:47:55.338
go to the front of the queue and I
think you could put that in place

1657
00:47:55.338 --> 00:47:57.172
think you could put that in place
with supermarkets. I come back to

1658
00:47:57.172 --> 00:47:58.755
with supermarkets. I come back to
this point, councils do need more

1659
00:47:58.755 --> 00:48:00.963
this point, councils do need more
help. From tomorrow morning, we are

1660
00:48:00.963 --> 00:48:02.588
help. From tomorrow morning, we are
waiving the 9:303m restriction on

1661
00:48:02.588 --> 00:48:02.713
waiving the 9:30am restriction on
older

1662
00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.588
waiving the 9:303m restriction on
older and disabled people using

1663
00:48:05.588 --> 00:48:05.797
older and disablad peopla using
their

1664
00:48:05.797 --> 00:48:09.547
older and disabled people using
their bus passes on mac or delete in

1665
00:48:09.547 --> 00:48:10.922
their bus passes on mac or delete in
Manchester, so they can get to the

1666
00:48:10.922 --> 00:48:14.130
Manchester, so they ran get to the
earty morning

1667
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.463
Manchester, so they can get to the
early morning shopping hours. But

1668
00:48:15.463 --> 00:48:15.922
earty morning shopping hours. But
please think

1669
00:48:15.922 --> 00:48:16.797
early morning shopping hours. But
please think about the capacity of

1670
00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:18.172
please think about the capacity of
councils. We have had a decade here

1671
00:48:18.172 --> 00:48:19.797
councils. We have had a decade here
where we are not in the best place

1672
00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.130
where we are not in the best place
to face this, because the resilience

1673
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:24.630
to face this, because the resilience
of some of our public services has

1674
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:25.422
of some of our public services has
been really degraded. Your

1675
00:48:25.422 --> 00:48:26.422
been really degraded. Your
predecessor was on Newsnight the

1676
00:48:26.422 --> 00:48:28.005
predecessor was on Newsnight the
other night and said he regretted

1677
00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:31.422
other night and said he regretted
the silent social care cuts. Silent?

1678
00:48:31.422 --> 00:48:32.047
the silant social rare cuts. Silant?
I was pointing

1679
00:48:32.047 --> 00:48:33.172
the silent social care cuts. Silent?
I was pointing them out to him every

1680
00:48:33.172 --> 00:48:33.755
I was pointing them out to him every
single day, he

1681
00:48:33.755 --> 00:48:33.963
I was pointing them out to him every
single day, hejust

1682
00:48:33.963 --> 00:48:34.588
I was pointing them out to him every
single day, he just chose not to

1683
00:48:34.588 --> 00:48:36.463
singla day, he just chose not to
listen to

1684
00:48:36.463 --> 00:48:37.422
single day, he just chose not to
listen to what I was saying. As

1685
00:48:37.422 --> 00:48:38.922
listen to what I was saying. As
Frances was saying, there has to be

1686
00:48:38.922 --> 00:48:40.047
Frances was saying, there has to be
some reassessment when we get

1687
00:48:40.047 --> 00:48:41.130
some reassessment when we get
through this, and we will get

1688
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.880
through this, and we will get
through this, of

1689
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.130
through this, and we will get
through this, ofjust how you cannot

1690
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:44.630
through this, ofjust how you cannot
mn

1691
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:45.588
through this, ofjust how you cannot
run essential services that councils

1692
00:48:45.588 --> 00:48:45.963
mn essential services that councils
provide on

1693
00:48:45.963 --> 00:48:47.338
run essential services that councils
provide on thin air and we do need

1694
00:48:47.338 --> 00:48:49.588
provide on thin air and we do need
to remember that, because it is

1695
00:48:49.588 --> 00:48:50.713
to remember that, because it is
about the resilience of the country

1696
00:48:50.713 --> 00:48:53.880
about the resilience of the country
at the end of the day. Let’s take

1697
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.713
at the end of the day. Let’s take
one more question, from Sam, again

1698
00:48:56.713 --> 00:48:57.797
one more question, from Sam, again
from Weston—super—Mare, and is an

1699
00:48:57.797 --> 00:48:58.005
from Weston-super-Mare, and is an
A-level

1700
00:48:58.005 --> 00:49:01.463
from Weston—super—Mare, and is an
A—level student. My name is Sam, I’m

1701
00:49:01.463 --> 00:49:03.172
A-level student. My name is Sam, I’m
an A-level

1702
00:49:03.172 --> 00:49:04.713
A—level student. My name is Sam, I’m
an A—level student and my question

1703
00:49:04.713 --> 00:49:05.922
an A-level student and my question
is given the

1704
00:49:05.922 --> 00:49:06.463
an A—level student and my question
is given the cancellation of GCSEs

1705
00:49:06.463 --> 00:49:06.963
is given the cancellation of 6655
and

1706
00:49:06.963 --> 00:49:09.130
is given the cancellation of GCSEs
and A—levels this year, what is the

1707
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:09.380
and A-levels this year, what is the
fairest

1708
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.172
and A—levels this year, what is the
fairest alternative for the students

1709
00:49:10.172 --> 00:49:12.213
fairest alternative for the students
that have worked so hard for two

1710
00:49:12.213 --> 00:49:14.088
that have worked so hard for two
years? Is it the case that this year

1711
00:49:14.088 --> 00:49:14.505
years? Is it the use that this year
EWUP

1712
00:49:14.505 --> 00:49:14.963
years? Is it the use that this year
group will be

1713
00:49:14.963 --> 00:49:17.963
years? Is it the case that this year
group will be the one written off by

1714
00:49:17.963 --> 00:49:18.713
group will be the one written off by
universities and future employers?

1715
00:49:18.713 --> 00:49:20.547
universities and future employers?
Frances, I am sure you have been

1716
00:49:20.547 --> 00:49:21.130
Frances, I am sure you have been
talking to head

1717
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:21.672
Frances, I am sure you have been
talking to headteachers and

1718
00:49:21.672 --> 00:49:22.755
Frances, I am sure you have been
talking to head teachers and all

1719
00:49:22.755 --> 00:49:25.130
talking to head teachers and all
sorts about this. What is the view,

1720
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.547
sorts about this. what is the view,
where are

1721
00:49:25.547 --> 00:49:27.047
sorts about this. What is the view,
where are we heading? First of all,

1722
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:29.380
where are we heading? First of all,
my heart breaks for him and anybody

1723
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.088
my heart breaks for him and anybody
who has kids that age going through

1724
00:49:32.088 --> 00:49:32.755
who has kids that age going through
exams, they know

1725
00:49:32.755 --> 00:49:33.338
who has kids that age going through
exams, they knowjust how that

1726
00:49:33.338 --> 00:49:36.713
exams, they know just how that
feels. So

1727
00:49:36.713 --> 00:49:37.963
exams, they knowjust how that
feels. So I think it is really

1728
00:49:37.963 --> 00:49:38.463
feels. So I think it is really
important and

1729
00:49:38.463 --> 00:49:38.672
feels. So I think it is really
importantand I’m

1730
00:49:38.672 --> 00:49:39.130
feels. So I think it is really
important and I’m sure the

1731
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.380
important and I’m sure the
Government will be on this, they

1732
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.213
Government will be on this, they
will provide some real reassurance

1733
00:49:44.213 --> 00:49:46.255
will provide some real reassurance
to that generation of young people

1734
00:49:46.255 --> 00:49:46.755
to that generation of young peopla
that, you

1735
00:49:46.755 --> 00:49:47.547
to that generation of young people
that, you know... Are you getting

1736
00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:50.213
that, you know... Are you getting
any sense of how teachers, what they

1737
00:49:50.213 --> 00:49:53.547
any sense of how teachers, what they
would think? Yes, I can tell you

1738
00:49:53.547 --> 00:49:54.422
would think? Yes, I ran tell you
they are

1739
00:49:54.422 --> 00:49:55.380
would think? Yes, I can tell you
they are desperate for really clear

1740
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.380
they are desperate for really clear
guidance. So they are glad that a

1741
00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.463
guidance. So they are glad that a
decision has been taken, because

1742
00:49:58.463 --> 00:50:00.297
decision has been taken, because
what they were seeing was individual

1743
00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:03.630
what they were seeing was individual
schools having to close, probably

1744
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:07.588
schools having to close, probably
because of their own staff capacity

1745
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:09.547
because of their own staff capacity
or sickness, all issues, so they are

1746
00:50:09.547 --> 00:50:11.380
or sickness, all issues, so they are
glad there is a decision. They now

1747
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.755
glad there is a decision. They now
need really clear guidance on who

1748
00:50:12.755 --> 00:50:15.838
need really clear guidance on who
are the children of key workers, how

1749
00:50:15.838 --> 00:50:19.297
are the children of key workers, how
are we going to make sure that young

1750
00:50:19.297 --> 00:50:19.922
are we going to make sure that young
peopla are

1751
00:50:19.922 --> 00:50:20.672
are we going to make sure that young
people are getting that assessment

1752
00:50:20.672 --> 00:50:22.672
people are getting that assessment
that is fair and kind to them, given

1753
00:50:22.672 --> 00:50:24.880
that is fair and kind to them, given
what therve

1754
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.297
that is fair and kind to them, given
what they’ve been through, what do

1755
00:50:26.297 --> 00:50:26.672
what therve been through, what do
we do

1756
00:50:26.672 --> 00:50:28.130
what they’ve been through, what do
we do about kids in poverty, not

1757
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.130
we do about kids in poverty, not
just kids on free school meals, but

1758
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:32.255
just kids on free school meals, but
we know because of what is happening

1759
00:50:32.255 --> 00:50:34.255
we know because of what is happening
with their parents that there are

1760
00:50:34.255 --> 00:50:36.005
with their parents that there are
going to be more and more children

1761
00:50:36.005 --> 00:50:38.922
going to be more and more children
joining the ranks of the poor, how

1762
00:50:38.922 --> 00:50:41.588
joining the ranks of the poor, how
do we look after them? That is where

1763
00:50:41.588 --> 00:50:42.380
do we look after them? That is where
councils and voluntary organisations

1764
00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.297
councils and voluntary organisations
are so important. And also

1765
00:50:46.297 --> 00:50:46.630
councils and voluntary organisations
are so important. And alsojust

1766
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.838
councils and voluntary organisations
are so important. And also just to

1767
00:50:46.838 --> 00:50:49.297
are so important. And also just to
remember that teachers are mums and

1768
00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:50.672
remember that teachers are mums and
dads, too, very often and they have

1769
00:50:50.672 --> 00:50:54.713
dads, too, very often and they have
got those worries about what to do I

1770
00:50:54.713 --> 00:50:58.338
got those worries about what to do I
do? What happens if I need to

1771
00:50:58.338 --> 00:50:59.672
do? What happens if I need to
self—isolate? So, again, we need

1772
00:50:59.672 --> 00:51:01.380
self-isolate? So, again, we need
some real

1773
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.755
self—isolate? So, again, we need
some real help for parents, I think.

1774
00:51:02.755 --> 00:51:05.505
some real help for parents, I think.
We have unpaid emergency leave in

1775
00:51:05.505 --> 00:51:07.047
We have unpaid emergency leave in
this country. Again, unpaid isn’t

1776
00:51:07.047 --> 00:51:09.422
this country. Again, unpaid isn’t
going to put food on the table so we

1777
00:51:09.422 --> 00:51:12.838
going to put food on the table so we
need a joined up approach but I

1778
00:51:12.838 --> 00:51:14.880
need a joined up approach but I
think teachers and support staff,

1779
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.672
think teachers and support staff,
who are critical again, we need

1780
00:51:16.672 --> 00:51:17.463
who are critical again, we need
dean

1781
00:51:17.463 --> 00:51:18.713
who are critical again, we need
clean schools to keep operating, but

1782
00:51:18.713 --> 00:51:20.088
dean schools to keep operating, but
they want to

1783
00:51:20.088 --> 00:51:21.047
clean schools to keep operating, but
they want to be in the room with

1784
00:51:21.047 --> 00:51:24.922
they want to be in the room with
ministers talking about this, head

1785
00:51:24.922 --> 00:51:25.713
ministers talking about this, head
teachers, teachers, support staff,

1786
00:51:25.713 --> 00:51:27.338
teachers, teachers, support staff,
because they are the ones that have

1787
00:51:27.338 --> 00:51:28.838
because they are the ones that have
to make it work, so they are

1788
00:51:28.838 --> 00:51:31.547
to make it work, so they are
desperate to have real dialogue. Let

1789
00:51:31.547 --> 00:51:33.672
desperate to have real dialogue. Let
me relay a tweet from Kevin, who put

1790
00:51:33.672 --> 00:51:34.838
me relay a tweet from Kevin, who put
when will pupils

1791
00:51:34.838 --> 00:51:35.713
me relay 3 tweet from Kevin, who put
when will pupils find out about her

1792
00:51:35.713 --> 00:51:35.838
when will pupils find out about her
GGFs

1793
00:51:35.838 --> 00:51:38.213
when will pupils find out about her
GCSEs and A—levels are going to be

1794
00:51:38.213 --> 00:51:39.797
GCSEs and A—levels are going to be
awarded? He goes on to say today has

1795
00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:41.213
awarded? He goes on to say today has
been one of the hardest days I’ve

1796
00:51:41.213 --> 00:51:43.338
been one of the hardest days I’ve
ever known as a teacher, saying

1797
00:51:43.338 --> 00:51:44.255
ever known as a teacher, saying
goodbye to these pupils without

1798
00:51:44.255 --> 00:51:45.838
goodbye to these pupils without
being able to answer their

1799
00:51:45.838 --> 00:51:48.880
being able to answer their
questions. It must be very

1800
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.880
questions. It must be very
difficult. I got a teenage daughter

1801
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.172
difficult. I got a teenage daughter
who is in that exact situation, she

1802
00:51:53.172 --> 00:51:54.422
who is in that exact situation, she
found out yesterday her GCSEs have

1803
00:51:54.422 --> 00:51:55.713
found out yesterday her 6655 have
been

1804
00:51:55.713 --> 00:51:57.338
found out yesterday her GCSEs have
been cancelled, on the background of

1805
00:51:57.338 --> 00:51:59.338
been cancelled, on the background of
a couple of weeks of increasing

1806
00:51:59.338 --> 00:52:00.338
a couple of weeks of increasing
anxiety and increasing numbers of

1807
00:52:00.338 --> 00:52:03.713
anxiety and increasing numbers of
kids not going to school and parents

1808
00:52:03.713 --> 00:52:05.088
kids not going to school and parents
worrying. In fact,

1809
00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:05.463
kids not going to school and parents
worrying. Infect, I have

1810
00:52:05.463 --> 00:52:06.005
kids not going to school and parents
worrying. In fact, I have been doing

1811
00:52:06.005 --> 00:52:07.088
worrying. In fact, I have been doing
Twitter polls to try and gauge

1812
00:52:07.088 --> 00:52:07.255
Twitter polls to try and gauge
pub“:

1813
00:52:07.255 --> 00:52:08.255
Twitter polls to try and gauge
public opinion on some of these

1814
00:52:08.255 --> 00:52:10.338
public opinion on some of these
issues about where they stand

1815
00:52:10.338 --> 00:52:11.963
issues about where they stand
compared to what the official

1816
00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:13.630
compared to what the official
advices and I think, although the

1817
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:14.963
advices and I think, although the
scientific advice has been we don’t

1818
00:52:14.963 --> 00:52:18.338
scientific advice has been we don’t
need to close the schools yet in

1819
00:52:18.338 --> 00:52:19.422
need to close the schools yet in
terms of controlling the outbreak,

1820
00:52:19.422 --> 00:52:21.130
terms of controlling the outbreak,
it has become clear that it

1821
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.963
it has become clear that it
increasingly was going to be

1822
00:52:22.963 --> 00:52:24.505
increasingly was going to be
difficult to continue with this

1823
00:52:24.505 --> 00:52:27.005
difficult to continue with this
situation. I think to try and answer

1824
00:52:27.005 --> 00:52:28.422
situation. I think to try and answer
the question from Sam about what is

1825
00:52:28.422 --> 00:52:33.005
the question from Sam about what is
the fairest way. I mean, clearly,

1826
00:52:33.005 --> 00:52:33.547
the fairest way. I mean, dearty,
when I did,

1827
00:52:33.547 --> 00:52:35.713
the fairest way. I mean, clearly,
when I did, they were called our

1828
00:52:35.713 --> 00:52:36.672
when I did, they were called our
levels back then... I remember

1829
00:52:36.672 --> 00:52:39.422
levels back then... I remember
those, quite a few of us on the

1830
00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:44.713
those, quite a few of us on the
panel remember —— 0 levels. You did

1831
00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:45.838
panel remember -- 0 levels. You did
quite a bit of the

1832
00:52:45.838 --> 00:52:46.422
panel remember —— 0 levels. You did
quite a bit of the work through the

1833
00:52:46.422 --> 00:52:51.130
quite a bit of the work through the
year and then there was the exam but

1834
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.172
year and then there was the exam but
now, quite a lot of work is done

1835
00:52:53.172 --> 00:52:54.297
now, quite a lot of work is done
through the year through coursework

1836
00:52:54.297 --> 00:52:55.338
through the year through coursework
and then other assessments that

1837
00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:56.880
and then other assessments that
there is experience in the community

1838
00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.172
there is experience in the community
on how to look at the school

1839
00:52:59.172 --> 00:53:00.463
on how to look at the school
children’s coursework and making an

1840
00:53:00.463 --> 00:53:01.963
children’s coursework and making an
assessment of their grades overall,

1841
00:53:01.963 --> 00:53:04.463
assessment of their grades overall,
so it is going to be a time of

1842
00:53:04.463 --> 00:53:06.213
so it is going to be a time of
anxiety for them, mixed with great

1843
00:53:06.213 --> 00:53:08.047
anxiety for them, mixed with great
rejoicing. Some of them are in two

1844
00:53:08.047 --> 00:53:12.463
rejoicing. Some of them are in two
minds! Yes, mixed feelings, perhaps.

1845
00:53:12.463 --> 00:53:13.130
minds! Yes, mixed feelings, perhaps.
So clarity and

1846
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.630
minds! Yes, mixed feelings, perhaps.
50 clarity and resolution in the

1847
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:17.255
So clarity and resolution in the
next few weeks. As I understand, we

1848
00:53:17.255 --> 00:53:18.880
next few weeks. As I understand, we
will hear tomorrow, is that right,

1849
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.297
will hear tomorrow, is that right,
exactly what is happening with GCSEs

1850
00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:20.505
exactly what is happening with 6655
and

1851
00:53:20.505 --> 00:53:23.172
exactly what is happening with GCSEs
and A—levels on how children will be

1852
00:53:23.172 --> 00:53:23.547
and A-levels on how children will be
able to

1853
00:53:23.547 --> 00:53:24.338
and A—levels on how children will be
able to proceed? And this question

1854
00:53:24.338 --> 00:53:26.922
able to proceed? And this question
of the key workers as well, exactly

1855
00:53:26.922 --> 00:53:28.297
of the key workers as well, exactly
how that is defined. I have been

1856
00:53:28.297 --> 00:53:30.547
how that is defined. I have been
working on that today. Is there

1857
00:53:30.547 --> 00:53:33.255
working on that today. Is there
anything you can tell us about that?

1858
00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:34.130
anything you ran tell us about that?
It will

1859
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.297
anything you can tell us about that?
It will include not only NHS staff

1860
00:53:35.297 --> 00:53:37.130
It will include not only NHS staff
but also social care and those who

1861
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.838
but also social rare and those who
are working on

1862
00:53:39.838 --> 00:53:41.255
but also social care and those who
are working on the supply of medical

1863
00:53:41.255 --> 00:53:43.130
are working on the supply of medical
devices, like the sort of masks we

1864
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:45.005
devices, like the sort of masks we
were talking about at the top of the

1865
00:53:45.005 --> 00:53:46.130
were talking about at the top of the
programme. What about people who

1866
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.422
programme. what about peopla who
work in

1867
00:53:46.422 --> 00:53:49.547
programme. What about people who
work in supermarkets? Well, the list

1868
00:53:49.547 --> 00:53:50.713
work in supermarkets? Well, the list
will be published tomorrow, we know

1869
00:53:50.713 --> 00:53:52.130
will be published tomorrow, we know
we have to get it out tomorrow

1870
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.838
we have to get it out tomorrow
because the schools are closing to

1871
00:53:53.838 --> 00:53:57.297
because the schools are closing to
everybody else from Monday. This was

1872
00:53:57.297 --> 00:53:59.172
everybody else from Monday. This was
a decision nobody wanted to take, it

1873
00:53:59.172 --> 00:54:01.422
a decision nobody wanted to take, it
is just an awful situation and my

1874
00:54:01.422 --> 00:54:04.005
is just an awful situation and my
heart goes out to Sam, who has

1875
00:54:04.005 --> 00:54:05.380
heart goes out to Sam, who has
worked so hard, and everybody in

1876
00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.505
worked so hard, and everybody in
that situation, so we will get that

1877
00:54:08.505 --> 00:54:10.922
that situation, so we will get that
information out as fast as we

1878
00:54:10.922 --> 00:54:12.547
information out as fast as we
possibly can. Has all of this

1879
00:54:12.547 --> 00:54:12.630
possibly ran. Has all of this
happened

1880
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.130
possibly can. Has all of this
happened a lot faster than you were

1881
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:18.463
happened a lot faster than you were
expecting? No, it hasn’t. All of the

1882
00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:20.422
expecting? No, it hasn’t. All of the
steps we have had to take, they were

1883
00:54:20.422 --> 00:54:22.130
steps we have had to take, they were
put out in the action plan two weeks

1884
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.547
put out in the action plan two weeks
ago. But it was only a few days ago

1885
00:54:24.547 --> 00:54:25.922
ago. But it was only a few days ago
it was no question of closing the

1886
00:54:25.922 --> 00:54:29.338
it was no question of closing the
schools. That is not quite right, we

1887
00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:31.088
schools. That is not quite right, we
have always been clear that we

1888
00:54:31.088 --> 00:54:32.713
have always been clear that we
weren’t doing the steps at that

1889
00:54:32.713 --> 00:54:34.338
weren’t doing the steps at that
moment but would be prepared to if

1890
00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:36.088
moment but would be prepared to if
we needed to and then we got to the

1891
00:54:36.088 --> 00:54:40.255
we needed to and then we got to the
point where we needed to. You know,

1892
00:54:40.255 --> 00:54:41.880
point where we needed to. You know,
we have always said, along this

1893
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.505
we have always said, along this
terrible journey,

1894
00:54:42.505 --> 00:54:42.713
we have always said, along this
terriblejourney, as

1895
00:54:42.713 --> 00:54:42.922
we have always said, along this
terrible journey, as we

1896
00:54:42.922 --> 00:54:43.713
we have always said, along this
terriblejourney, as we have been

1897
00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:44.213
terrible journey, as we have been
trying to

1898
00:54:44.213 --> 00:54:45.297
terriblejourney, as we have been
trying to battle this disease, we

1899
00:54:45.297 --> 00:54:48.255
trying to battle this disease, we
will do the right thing at the right

1900
00:54:48.255 --> 00:54:49.922
will do the right thing at the right
time and the decision of school

1901
00:54:49.922 --> 00:54:52.213
time and the decision of school
closures had to be made, because we

1902
00:54:52.213 --> 00:54:56.380
closures had to be made, because we
have got to get the virus under

1903
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.255
have got to get the virus under
control and, also, the faster we can

1904
00:54:58.255 --> 00:54:59.338
control and, also, the faster we ran
get it under

1905
00:54:59.338 --> 00:55:00.297
control and, also, the faster we can
get it under control, the faster we

1906
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:00.505
get it under control, the faster we
ran

1907
00:55:00.505 --> 00:55:02.088
get it under control, the faster we
can release some of these measures,

1908
00:55:02.088 --> 00:55:03.338
ran release some of these measures,
as well as

1909
00:55:03.338 --> 00:55:04.338
can release some of these measures,
as well as putting in the place the

1910
00:55:04.338 --> 00:55:06.005
as well as putting in the place the
testing we were talking about at the

1911
00:55:06.005 --> 00:55:09.547
testing we were talking about at the
start of the programme. I agree with

1912
00:55:09.547 --> 00:55:11.088
start of the programme. I agree with
what Matt is saying, I think it was

1913
00:55:11.088 --> 00:55:11.713
what Matt is saying, I think it was
the right all

1914
00:55:11.713 --> 00:55:13.130
what Matt is saying, I think it was
the right call and I remember being

1915
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.505
the right all and I remember being
in the

1916
00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:15.588
the right call and I remember being
in the same position when things

1917
00:55:15.588 --> 00:55:16.922
in the same position when things
that went looking that possible all

1918
00:55:16.922 --> 00:55:17.422
that went looking that possibla all
of a

1919
00:55:17.422 --> 00:55:18.588
that went looking that possible all
of a sudden become sober, because

1920
00:55:18.588 --> 00:55:19.672
of a sudden become sober, because
this week, head

1921
00:55:19.672 --> 00:55:20.338
of a sudden become sober, because
this week, headteachers were

1922
00:55:20.338 --> 00:55:20.922
this week, head teachers were
finding

1923
00:55:20.922 --> 00:55:21.963
this week, headteachers were
finding things quite uncensored ——

1924
00:55:21.963 --> 00:55:25.630
finding things quite uncensored ——
unsustainable on the ground because

1925
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:26.088
unsustainable on the ground berause
pupils were

1926
00:55:26.088 --> 00:55:27.047
unsustainable on the ground because
pupils were off, staff are off and

1927
00:55:27.047 --> 00:55:28.422
pupils were off, staff are off and
it was hard to hold things together.

1928
00:55:28.422 --> 00:55:28.755
it was hard to hold things together.
MY

1929
00:55:28.755 --> 00:55:33.463
it was hard to hold things together.
My daughter is the same, my daughter

1930
00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:34.922
My daughter is the same, my daughter
is an A—level student, definitely in

1931
00:55:34.922 --> 00:55:35.463
is an A-level student, definitely in
two minds,

1932
00:55:35.463 --> 00:55:36.963
is an A—level student, definitely in
two minds, half of her wanted to

1933
00:55:36.963 --> 00:55:38.172
two minds, half of her wanted to
cry, half wanting to get the

1934
00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:41.713
cry, half wanting to get the
champagne out. I have a feeling

1935
00:55:41.713 --> 00:55:43.755
champagne out. I have a feeling
about this, having spoken to her

1936
00:55:43.755 --> 00:55:44.130
about this, having spoken to her
today, I

1937
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:44.338
about this, having spoken to her
today, Ithink

1938
00:55:44.338 --> 00:55:45.297
about this, having spoken to her
today, I think there has to be a

1939
00:55:45.297 --> 00:55:46.755
today, I think there has to be a
fair process that looks not

1940
00:55:46.755 --> 00:55:47.463
today, I think there has to be a
fair process that looks notjust

1941
00:55:47.463 --> 00:55:47.588
fair process that looks not just
that

1942
00:55:47.588 --> 00:55:49.255
fair process that looks notjust
that one thing, not

1943
00:55:49.255 --> 00:55:51.047
fair process that looks notjust
that one thing, notjust predictive

1944
00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:51.463
that one thing, not just predictive
grades, but

1945
00:55:51.463 --> 00:55:52.547
that one thing, notjust predictive
grades, but works and takes a

1946
00:55:52.547 --> 00:55:55.213
grades, but works and takes a
rounded view and a fair process,

1947
00:55:55.213 --> 00:55:56.713
rounded view and a fair process,
but, then again, let some who want

1948
00:55:56.713 --> 00:55:59.547
but, then again, let some who want
to rerun the year. I know that might

1949
00:55:59.547 --> 00:56:01.088
to rerun the year. I know that might
create capacity issues and colleges

1950
00:56:01.088 --> 00:56:07.130
create capacity issues and colleges
colleges but this can’t be the last

1951
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.255
colleges but this can’t be the last
Covid generation, it can’t be your

1952
00:56:09.255 --> 00:56:10.630
Covid generation, it can’t be your
year was unlucky and sorry and no

1953
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:11.963
year was unlucky and sorry and no
one gets the University they want

1954
00:56:11.963 --> 00:56:13.297
one gets the University they want
and lives are thrown upside down.

1955
00:56:13.297 --> 00:56:15.672
and lives are thrown upside down.
You need to take the most permissive

1956
00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:16.630
You need to take the most permissive
and supportive approach and I

1957
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.297
and supportive approach and I
thought I was hearing that from the

1958
00:56:18.297 --> 00:56:19.547
thought I was hearing that from the
Prime Minister yesterday and I have

1959
00:56:19.547 --> 00:56:20.547
Prime Minister yesterday and I have
confidence the Government will come

1960
00:56:20.547 --> 00:56:21.672
confidence the Government will come
forward with a fair process

1961
00:56:21.672 --> 00:56:24.838
forward with a fair process
tomorrow. You feel for all of these

1962
00:56:24.838 --> 00:56:25.463
tomorrow. You feel for all of these
peopla who

1963
00:56:25.463 --> 00:56:26.338
tomorrow. You feel for all of these
people who have studied and worked

1964
00:56:26.338 --> 00:56:26.713
peopla who have studied and worked
so hard

1965
00:56:26.713 --> 00:56:28.130
people who have studied and worked
so hard and we hope that they get a

1966
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.422
so hard and we hope that they get a
full decision about what will happen

1967
00:56:30.422 --> 00:56:32.463
full decision about what will happen
with their exams. As you said,

1968
00:56:32.463 --> 00:56:33.672
with their exams. As you said,
Frances, I have friends who are

1969
00:56:33.672 --> 00:56:36.422
Frances, I have friends who are
teachers and they have children of

1970
00:56:36.422 --> 00:56:38.963
teachers and they have children of
school and it can be challenging on

1971
00:56:38.963 --> 00:56:39.380
school and it ran be challanging on
many fronts,

1972
00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.047
school and it can be challenging on
many fronts, actually, lots of

1973
00:56:40.047 --> 00:56:43.463
many fronts, actually, lots of
children of school. Exams weren’t

1974
00:56:43.463 --> 00:56:45.422
children of school. Exams weren’t
always that fair, what do you went

1975
00:56:45.422 --> 00:56:48.505
always that fair, what do you went
into the room, so this could be a

1976
00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.130
into the room, so this could be a
fairer process. Universities will be

1977
00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:51.338
fairer process. Universities will be
sympathetic, I am at the University

1978
00:56:51.338 --> 00:56:52.922
sympathetic, I am at the University
of Liverpool and there has been a

1979
00:56:52.922 --> 00:56:54.672
of Liverpool and there has been a
lot of thinking about looking after

1980
00:56:54.672 --> 00:56:56.297
lot of thinking about looking after
both our current students, who are

1981
00:56:56.297 --> 00:56:58.713
both our current students, who are
all working remotely are not missing

1982
00:56:58.713 --> 00:56:59.255
all working remotely are not missing
lassons, it is

1983
00:56:59.255 --> 00:56:59.880
all working remotely are not missing
lessons, it is all happening online

1984
00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.338
lassons, it is all happening online
but also

1985
00:57:00.338 --> 00:57:01.838
lessons, it is all happening online
but also how we look at the future

1986
00:57:01.838 --> 00:57:04.505
but also how we look at the future
students and make sure they have

1987
00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:07.130
students and make sure they have
their access. As you say, this will

1988
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:08.713
their access. As you say, this will
be the Covid generation. There is

1989
00:57:08.713 --> 00:57:10.547
be the Covid generation. There is
one further point to make, which is

1990
00:57:10.547 --> 00:57:12.255
one further point to make, which is
when that kids are off school, they

1991
00:57:12.255 --> 00:57:13.630
when that kids are off school, they
mustn’t go and stay with their

1992
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.963
mustn’t go and stay with their
grandparents if they are over 70,

1993
00:57:15.963 --> 00:57:18.005
grandparents if they are over 70,
because that would be

1994
00:57:18.005 --> 00:57:19.088
because that would be
counter—productive. So the kids have

1995
00:57:19.088 --> 00:57:22.047
counter-productive. So the kids have
got to stay. . .

1996
00:57:22.047 --> 00:57:23.505
counter—productive. So the kids have
got to stay... Those kids who stay

1997
00:57:23.505 --> 00:57:24.547
got to stay... Those kids who stay
in school who only have grandparents

1998
00:57:24.547 --> 00:57:29.338
in school who only have grandparents
as an option? That is an important

1999
00:57:29.338 --> 00:57:30.088
as an option? That is an important
point and slightly surprising.

2000
00:57:30.088 --> 00:57:32.213
point and slightly surprising.
Schools, clearly something had to

2001
00:57:32.213 --> 00:57:33.130
Schools, dearty something had to
change and

2002
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:34.130
Schools, clearly something had to
change and this is now the big

2003
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.255
change and this is now the big
decision you have to make over what

2004
00:57:36.255 --> 00:57:37.338
decision you have to make over what
our key workers. An alternative

2005
00:57:37.338 --> 00:57:39.297
our key workers. An alternative
approach would have been to say

2006
00:57:39.297 --> 00:57:41.255
approach would have been to say
school is no longer compulsory in

2007
00:57:41.255 --> 00:57:42.797
school is no longer compulsory in
this country and parents can decide

2008
00:57:42.797 --> 00:57:43.005
this country and parents ran decide
what

2009
00:57:43.005 --> 00:57:43.963
this country and parents can decide
what their needs are, their own

2010
00:57:43.963 --> 00:57:45.297
what their needs are, their own
needs and the needs of the children

2011
00:57:45.297 --> 00:57:49.088
needs and the needs of the children
and then you would avoid this really

2012
00:57:49.088 --> 00:57:51.213
and then you would avoid this really
difficult decision about what is a

2013
00:57:51.213 --> 00:57:52.422
difficult decision about what is a
key worker, because most workers are

2014
00:57:52.422 --> 00:57:54.047
key worker, because most workers are
key in some way and those who could

2015
00:57:54.047 --> 00:57:55.672
key in some way and those who could
look after their own kids because,

2016
00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.088
look after their own kids because,
between the parents they can work it

2017
00:57:57.088 --> 00:57:57.922
between the parents they ran work it
out, who ran

2018
00:57:57.922 --> 00:57:59.797
between the parents they can work it
out, who can stay at home, that

2019
00:57:59.797 --> 00:57:59.922
out, who ran stay at home, that
would

2020
00:57:59.922 --> 00:58:00.713
out, who can stay at home, that
would work. Those where grandparents

2021
00:58:00.713 --> 00:58:02.338
would work. Those where grandparents
are the only option and we don’t

2022
00:58:02.338 --> 00:58:03.672
are the only option and we don’t
want them staying with grandparents,

2023
00:58:03.672 --> 00:58:04.297
want them staying with grandparents,
they ran be

2024
00:58:04.297 --> 00:58:05.338
want them staying with grandparents,
they can be put into school and it

2025
00:58:05.338 --> 00:58:05.755
they ran be put into school and it
would be

2026
00:58:05.755 --> 00:58:06.963
they can be put into school and it
would be a much smaller number than

2027
00:58:06.963 --> 00:58:08.922
would be a much smaller number than
it is now, it could be

2028
00:58:08.922 --> 00:58:09.505
would be a much smaller number than
it is now, it could bejudged by the

2029
00:58:09.505 --> 00:58:09.963
it is now, it could be judged by the
number of

2030
00:58:09.963 --> 00:58:12.130
it is now, it could bejudged by the
number of teachers, you will have

2031
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.130
number of teachers, you will have
more space in school and

2032
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.922
more space in school and
potentially, it would have been an

2033
00:58:15.922 --> 00:58:17.505
potentially, it would have been an
alternative approach. Well, we will

2034
00:58:17.505 --> 00:58:18.922
alternative approach. Well, we will
hear tomorrow but there is a limit

2035
00:58:18.922 --> 00:58:21.755
hear tomorrow but there is a limit
to how much you want to tell us. Our

2036
00:58:21.755 --> 00:58:23.755
to how much you want to tell us. Our
our reserve, I’m afraid to say. It’s

2037
00:58:23.755 --> 00:58:25.380
our reserve, I’m afraid to say. It’s
been an interesting way of doing the

2038
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.505
been an interesting way of doing the
programme --

2039
00:58:27.505 --> 00:58:29.213
been an interesting way of doing the
programme —— our one hour is up. It

2040
00:58:29.213 --> 00:58:29.588
programme -- our one hour is up. It
has been

2041
00:58:29.588 --> 00:58:30.630
programme —— our one hour is up. It
has been rather quiet in some

2042
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:33.713
has been rather quiet in some
senses. I have missed you, audience,

2043
00:58:33.713 --> 00:58:35.297
senses. I have missed you, audience,
not having you here. I am pleased to

2071
00:59:31.713 --> 00:59:35.963
I can’t walk there. It’s the middle
of the desert! Ridiculous.

2072
00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:37.505
This is doing my head in.

2073
00:59:37.505 --> 00:59:40.213
I’m not used to travelling
like this, but I’m getting there.

2074
00:59:40.213 --> 00:59:43.130
The bus is about 30cm from the edge.

2075
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.880
I wish parts of Yorkshire
were this colourful.

2076
00:59:52.213 --> 00:59:54.130
Twin brothers...

2077
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:56.213
Divided by a secret.

MUSIC: Always On My Own by Cat Power

2079
01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.672
IN NORWEGIAN:

2080
01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.588
Kristofer Hivju stars
in compelling Norwegian drama...

2081
01:00:22.713 --> 01:00:24.755
We’re back! And I’m getting
the sewing room ready

2082
01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:26.297
for the biggest Bee ever.

2083
01:00:26.297 --> 01:00:28.130
I am going to go nuts in the
haberdashery.

2084
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.130
Do my best not to stab you. Ow!

2085
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.255
Wow. That’s my blood. Ignore that.

2086
01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:34.338
These things have been in storage
for the last year.

2087
01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:35.713
0h!

2088
01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:39.047
We’ve got more sewers and more
challenges than ever before.

2089
01:00:39.047 --> 01:00:41.463
HE WOLF WHISTLES
0K, guys, that’s a wrap.

2090
01:01:07.172 --> 01:01:08.922
There is strength in difference.

2091
01:01:08.922 --> 01:01:12.422
Another day in the death of Albion,
my friends.

2092
01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.338
We would recommend arresting him
immediately.

2093
01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.422
SHOUTING

2094
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.130
I want better than this.
No, you don’t.

2095
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:19.172
Yeah, I do! No, you don’t!

2096
01:01:19.172 --> 01:01:22.005
I know why you were at Onitem.
You were looking for her.

2097
01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:23.338
Sephy, come on!

2098
01:01:23.338 --> 01:01:25.588
You don’t want everyone knowing,
do you?

2099
01:01:25.588 --> 01:01:28.380
You want the Prime Minister gone,
I want the Prime Minister gone,

2100
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.797
which means we have business
together.

2101
01:01:30.797 --> 01:01:32.130
So, how does this end?

2102
01:01:34.005 --> 01:01:37.005
This programme contains
some strong language

2103
01:01:39.713 --> 01:01:42.422
When the Aprican settlers
first came to Albion,

2104
01:01:42.422 --> 01:01:45.255
they were faced with
a country in chaos.

2105
01:01:45.255 --> 01:01:50.130
An ongoing, brutal civil war
had left many of its barbaric

2106
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:54.005
inhabitants dying of plague
or starvation.

2107
01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:56.797
On! Get up! On yourfeet!

2108
01:01:56.797 --> 01:02:00.505
Rule by the African Empire was
demonstrably beneficial to the

2109
01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:03.255
peoples of Albion
in helping them to overcome

2110
01:02:03.255 --> 01:02:05.505
their own worst tendencies... Mm—mm.

2111
01:02:05.505 --> 01:02:08.088
Is there a problem, Persephone?

2112
01:02:08.088 --> 01:02:09.630
It’s rubbish!

2113
01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.755
It’s alljust meant to justify
treating Noughts the way we do.

2114
01:02:14.755 --> 01:02:17.463
If they’re still poor centuries
later, it’s their own fault.

2115
01:02:17.463 --> 01:02:19.922
It’s got nothing to do with us.

2116
01:02:19.922 --> 01:02:22.047
Kia. Kia.

2117
01:02:22.047 --> 01:02:23.922
Head up.

2118
01:02:23.922 --> 01:02:26.672
Go! Go! Go! Go!

2119
01:02:32.297 --> 01:02:33.422
Woo!

2120
01:02:35.172 --> 01:02:38.297
We’re going to make this more fun
for you idikidii blankers.

2121
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.547
Open your packs! Hurry up!

2122
01:02:42.547 --> 01:02:44.130
What is this?

2123
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:45.588
We’re done.

2124
01:02:45.588 --> 01:02:48.130
You’re done when I say so.

2125
01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:51.588
Hurry up!
Come on, peopla! Open up!

2126
01:02:51.588 --> 01:02:53.463
You speak for Noughts, do you?

2127
01:02:53.463 --> 01:02:55.588
It’s not as if there are any
Noughts here to do it.

2128
01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:58.463
Probably just as well.
Ten minutes of listening to you,

2129
01:02:58.463 --> 01:03:00.547
and they’d all sign up
for the Liberation Militia.

2130
01:03:00.547 --> 01:03:02.630
The Liberation Militia
are terrorists.

2131
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:05.088
The LM is what happens
when you push people too far!

2132
01:03:05.088 --> 01:03:07.088
Out, Miss Hadley.

2133
01:03:07.088 --> 01:03:08.213
Now.

2134
01:03:14.838 --> 01:03:16.172
Open up!

2135
01:03:17.672 --> 01:03:19.213
Not in hers.

2136
01:03:21.755 --> 01:03:23.130
Put it in his.

2137
01:03:27.547 --> 01:03:29.755
This is bullshit, Lekan.
What did you say?

2138
01:03:29.755 --> 01:03:31.130
I said this is bullshit.

2139
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:32.547
Shut up!

2140
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.338
Lieutenant Baako!
This exercise is over.

2141
01:03:38.338 --> 01:03:40.130
Watch yourself, McGregor.

2142
01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:35.213
For the first time
in Albion’s history,

2143
01:04:35.213 --> 01:04:38.380
Prime Minister Opal Folami has
sanctioned the public

2144
01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:43.213
celebration of the Nought festival,
Midsummer, in two days’ time.

2145
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.630
Under the circumstances, I think
you’re getting off pretty

2146
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.338
lightly with a written apology
to Mr Daramy.

2147
01:04:48.338 --> 01:04:50.213
I’ve told the head that you can be

2148
01:04:50.213 --> 01:04:52.588
deliberately provocative on occasion.

2149
01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.297
He’s an idiot, and I won’t write it.

2150
01:04:54.297 --> 01:04:58.505
And that you’ll grow out of teenage
politics soon enough.

2151
01:04:58.505 --> 01:05:01.672
Not that the Prime Minister
ever has.

2152
01:05:01.672 --> 01:05:04.880
You’re still angry about the Noughts
celebrating Midsummer?

2153
01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.838
Babe, what’s the harm in a few
street parties?

2154
01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:10.505
We’re in a period of civil unrest,
Sephy.

2155
01:05:10.505 --> 01:05:12.922
We struggle to keep up with
the threat from the terrorists
