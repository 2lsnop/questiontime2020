powerful area of high pressure
building its way in, suppressing all

building its way in, suppressing all

lighter winds further south, quite a
lot of sunshine so despite

00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:41.653
lot of sunshine so despite
temperatures looking a bit lower it

52
00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:43.944
temperatures looking a bit lower it
might feel quite pleasant if you get

53
00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:45.861
might feel quite pleasant if you get
yourself out of the breeze and into

54
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:47.069
yourself out of the breeze and into
some sunshine. A cold night

55
00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.403
If I could give my younger self
any advice, it would be...

56
00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:52.819
Be the best version of you
that you can be.

57
00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.236
Embrace it.

58
00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:57.028
It’s that element
of stepping yourself up.

59
00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:58.736
I mean, I love it.

Stevenson. With reducing passenger

112
00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:15.111
Stevenson. with reducing passenger
duty only

113
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:15.986
Stevenson. With reducing passenger
duty only lead to more domestic

114
00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:17.736
duty only lead to more domestic
ﬂights and

115
00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:18.903
duty only lead to more domestic
flights and worsen the climate

116
00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:20.736
ﬂights and worsen the climate
crisis?

117
00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:22.069
flights and worsen the climate
crisis? Flybe has been in the news,

118
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.361
crisis? Flybe has been in the news,
and it’s not entirely clear what the

119
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.153
and it’s not entirely clear what the
government is doing to help that

120
00:04:26.153 --> 00:04:27.153
government is doing to help that
ailing regional airline. What are

121
00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:29.528
ailing regionalairtine. what are
you doing?

122
00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:30.278
ailing regional airline. What are
you doing? Will you reduce air

123
00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:30.444
you doing? will you reduce air
passenger

124
00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:33.653
you doing? Will you reduce air
passenger duty to help them out? The

125
00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:35.069
passenger duty to help them out? The
top line, and the thing that I

126
00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.444
top line, and the thing that I
welcome as a government minister,

127
00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.528
welcome as a government minister,
with particular responsibility for

128
00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:41.819
with particular responsibility for
tourism, is that Flybe will keep

129
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:42.778
tourism, is that Flybe will keep
ﬂying, and

130
00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:44.111
tourism, is that Flybe will keep
flying, and that is really good

131
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:44.403
ﬂying, and that is really good
news,

132
00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:45.819
flying, and that is really good
news, because they operate over a

133
00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.611
news, because they operate over a
third of domestic flights in the UK

134
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:47.819
third of domestic ﬂights in the UK
and

135
00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.111
third of domestic flights in the UK
and connect parts of the UK, places

136
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.319
and connect parts of the UK, places
"TY

137
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.611
and connect parts of the UK, places
very hard to get to by any other

138
00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:52.986
very hard to get to by any other
means, so

139
00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:53.236
very hard to get to by any other
means, sol

140
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:54.986
very hard to get to by any other
means, so I think it’s a good thing

141
00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:58.361
means, so I think it’s a good thing
that Flybe will keep flying. I can’t

142
00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:58.986
that Flybe will keep ﬂying. I can’t
go into the

143
00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:00.361
that Flybe will keep flying. I can’t
go into the detail of what may or

144
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:03.944
go into the detail of what may or
may not have been agreed with Flybe.

145
00:05:03.944 --> 00:05:07.444
may not have been agreed with Flybe.
Should expect a reduction in air

146
00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:09.111
Should expect a reduction in air
passenger duty? The government will

147
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:11.153
passenger duty? The government will
review it, and they will want to

148
00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:12.486
review it, and they will want to
make sure that parts of the UK

149
00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:14.319
make sure that parts of the UK
continue to be connected and

150
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.236
continue to be connected and
recognise the role of flying is part

151
00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:20.028
recognise the role of ﬂying is part
of that.

152
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.528
recognise the role of flying is part
of that. It sounds like you are

153
00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:23.778
of that. It sounds like you are
softening it up for a reduction.

154
00:05:23.778 --> 00:05:25.528
softening it up for a reduction.
Wouldn’t want to speculate on the

155
00:05:25.528 --> 00:05:27.611
Wouldn’t want to speculate on the
outcome of any review, and we do

156
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:29.694
outcome of any review, and we do
that hand in aware of our ambitions

157
00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:31.819
that hand in aware of our ambitions
on climate change and our commitment

158
00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.069
on climate change and our commitment
to go zero carbon in 2050, which

159
00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.278
to go zero carbon in 2050, which
needs to happen hand—in—hand with

160
00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:38.319
needs to happen hand-in-hand with

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:25.153
points we need to take on board. One
is the need to decide what camp we

is the need to decide what ramp we
are going to be

255
00:08:26.194 --> 00:08:26.986
is the need to decide what camp we
are going to be in, whether we are

business model where it charges half
the price of other modes of

the price of other modes of

double tax rate because it flies

double tax rate because it ﬂies

293

amount of funds we are taking in

hypocritical and they need to either

00:09:56.444 --> 00:09:59.361
hypocritical and they need to either
support the airlines and bail them

303
00:09:59.361 --> 00:09:59.778
support the airtines and bail them
out or

304
00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:00.778
support the airlines and bail them
out or actually help the climate. We

315
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:31.278
towards it, so why are we letting
aeroplane companies stay put? Do you

316
00:10:31.278 --> 00:10:33.944
aeroplane companies stay put? Do you
think you would feel like that if

317
00:10:33.944 --> 00:10:36.153
think you would feel like that if
you worked for that company? It’s a

318
00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:37.319
you worked for that company? It’s a
difficult issue with employment, but

319
00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:39.653
difficult issue with employment, but
we need to put in steps and have

320
00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:40.653
we need to put in steps and have
other employment which relies on

321
00:10:40.653 --> 00:10:43.319
other employment which relies on
more renewable sources, and we need

322
00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:45.903
more renewable sources, and we need
to stop relying on fossil fuels as

323
00:10:45.903 --> 00:10:49.611
to stop relying on fossil fuels as
much for employment.

324

I am confused about what it is the

I am confused about what it is the
government is trying to achieve

328
00:10:56.736 --> 00:10:58.861
government is trying to achieve
because, on the one hand, their

329
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:00.028
because, on the one hand, their
justification is that they are keen

330
00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:01.903
justification is that they are keen
to rebalance the regions and

331
00:11:01.903 --> 00:11:05.528
to rebalance the regions and
demonstrate to them, their voter

332
00:11:05.528 --> 00:11:08.236
demonstrate to them, their voter
base, that they mean to level up the

333
00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:09.986
base, that they mean to level up the
economy, but at the same time this

334
00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:11.486
economy, but at the same time this
step has taken the effect of putting

335
00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:15.444
step has taken the effect of putting
a lot of money into which peoples

a lot of money into which peoplas
pockets,

337
00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:16.778
a lot of money into which peoples
pockets, because the consortium

pockets, because the consortium
which owns Flybe, you know, it is

339
00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:20.028
which owns Flybe, you know, it is
part of one of the biggest

of these people might have stepped

343
00:11:27.444 --> 00:11:29.069
of these people might have stepped
in to make up the air passenger duty

344
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:32.361
in to make up the air passenger duty
that was overdue? I don’t see why it

345
00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:33.528
that was overdue? I don’t see why it
necessarily had to come from the

346
00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:33.694
necessarily had to come from the
pub“:

completely contradictory set of

Scottish Government, you wanted to
reduce air passenger duty by 50% but

405
00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:15.069
reduce air passenger duty by 5096 but
then you wrote

406
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:16.153
reduce air passenger duty by 50% but
then you wrote back on it, so what

407
00:13:16.153 --> 00:13:19.069
then you wrote back on it, so what
is your view on helping out a

408
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:23.403
is your view on helping out a
company like Flybe? The Scottish

409
00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:24.819
company like Flybe? The Scottish
Government was the first country to

declare a climate emergency, we are

411

departure tax. That is a former
policy. We are in a climate

415

there are enough. We need action,

lifeline services, but we need to be
clear about moving away from carbon

465
00:15:01.236 --> 00:15:03.069
clear about moving away from carbon
to a sustainable economy, and

466

00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:15.944
inadequate for a developed country
like the British Isles. It zero in

471
00:15:15.944 --> 00:15:18.153
like the British Islas. It zero in
2050, that

472
00:15:18.153 --> 00:15:20.903
like the British Isles. It zero in
2050, that date was mentioned in the

473
00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:21.903
2050, that date was mentioned in the
international panel on climate

Celsius in global warming, above

477
00:15:29.153 --> 00:15:31.194
Celsius in global warming, above
which would be catastrophic. We are

478
00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:34.819
which would be catastrophic. We are
already going to suffer from serious

479
00:15:34.819 --> 00:15:37.319
already going to suffer from serious
consequences. Above that, even

480
00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:39.278
consequences. Above that, even
worse, tens to hundreds of millions

481
00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:42.111
worse, tens to hundreds of millions
of people displaced. The 2050 date

482
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:42.819
of peopla displaced. The 2050 date
is an

483
00:15:42.819 --> 00:15:43.986
of people displaced. The 2050 date
is an absolute copout for this

484
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.278
is an absolute copout for this
country. We are a developed country

485
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.736
country. We are a developed country
and should be leading the way. It

486
00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:51.153
and should be leading the way. It
should be brought forward. I

487
00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:51.694
and should be leading the way. It
should be brought forward. Ifind it

488
00:15:51.694 --> 00:15:53.694
should be brought forward. Ifind it
quite ironic that the SNP are saying

489
00:15:53.694 --> 00:15:55.236
quite ironic that the SNP are saying
that the carbon neutral thing is

490
00:15:55.236 --> 00:15:58.528
that the carbon neutral thing is
important, which it is, but isn’t

491
00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:01.194
important, which it is, but isn’t
Nicola Sturgeon’s main budget plan,

Nicola Sturgeon’s main budget plan,
if they get independence, coming

493
00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:03.986
if they get independence, coming
from oil, which is a fossil

494
00:16:03.986 --> 00:16:04.236
if they get independence, coming
from oil, which is a fossilfuel

495
00:16:04.236 --> 00:16:04.653
from oil, which is a fossil fuel
used to

496
00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:07.986
from oil, which is a fossilfuel
used to pollute things? Maybe, if

497
00:16:07.986 --> 00:16:09.278
used to pollute things? Maybe, if
the SNP want to get independence,

498
00:16:09.278 --> 00:16:11.486
the SNP want to get independence,
she has to start looking at other

499
00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:11.694
she has to start looking at other
“75

500
00:16:11.694 --> 00:16:12.611
she has to start looking at other
ways of forming the economy, rather

501
00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:15.028
ways of forming the economy, rather
than relying on fossil

502
00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:15.486
ways of forming the economy, rather
than relying on fossilfuels, which

503
00:16:15.486 --> 00:16:15.986
than relying on fossil fuels, which
are killing the

504
00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:18.819
than relying on fossilfuels, which
are killing the planet? That is what

505
00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:20.153
are killing the planet? That is what
we are doing, investing massively in

506
00:16:20.153 --> 00:16:24.194
we are doing, investing massively in
renewables. Scotland has the energy

507
00:16:24.194 --> 00:16:27.278
renewables. Scotland has the energy
jackpot, we have got renewals, wind,

508
00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.444
jackpot, we have got renewals, wind,
wave, biomass, water

509
00:16:28.444 --> 00:16:28.944
jackpot, we have got renewals, wind,
wave, biomass, waterfalling from

510
00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:29.236
wave, biomass, water falling from
the sky

511
00:16:29.236 --> 00:16:31.069
wave, biomass, waterfalling from
the sky regularly, and all sorts of

512
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.444
the sky regularty, and all sorts of
stuff we

513
00:16:31.444 --> 00:16:33.903
the sky regularly, and all sorts of
stuff we are exporting, and you are

514
00:16:33.903 --> 00:16:35.111
stuff we are exporting, and you are
right, we need to decarbonise the

515
00:16:35.111 --> 00:16:35.486
right, we need to dearbonise the
economy and

516
00:16:35.486 --> 00:16:36.861
right, we need to decarbonise the
economy and we have a plan to do

517
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:38.236
economy and we have a plan to do
that. That is very much part of

518
00:16:38.236 --> 00:16:41.778
that. That is very much part of
Scottish economy. Ellen, let me come

519
00:16:41.778 --> 00:16:42.278
Scottish economy. Ellan, let me come
back to give

520
00:16:42.278 --> 00:16:45.236
Scottish economy. Ellen, let me come
back to give the let’s remind

521
00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:46.069
back to give the let’s remind
ourselves what David Attenborough

522
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.403
ourselves what David Athenborough
said today,

523
00:16:46.403 --> 00:16:48.111
ourselves what David Attenborough
said today, as well as now is the

524
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:49.903
said today, as well as now is the
moment of climate crisis, he said,

525
00:16:49.903 --> 00:16:52.278
moment of climate crisis, he said,
this is urgent, we know how to solve

526
00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:53.986
this is urgent, we know how to solve
it but we refuse to take steps we

527
00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:55.861
it but we refuse to take steps we
know have to be taken, so you

528
00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:57.194
know have to be taken, so you
represent the government which has

529
00:16:57.194 --> 00:16:57.903
represent the government which has
been in power

530
00:16:57.903 --> 00:16:58.444
represent the government which has
been in powerfor ten years

531
00:16:58.444 --> 00:16:58.986
represent the government which has
been in power for ten years and you

532
00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:00.319
been in power for ten years and you
refuse to take the steps which have

533
00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:05.986
refuse to take the steps which have
to be taken.

534
00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:10.986
Since 2015, our greenhouse gas
emissions have been reduced by 25%,

535
00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:11.569
emissions have been reduced by 2596,
while the

536
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.194
emissions have been reduced by 25%,
while the economy has been growing.

537
00:17:14.194 --> 00:17:15.444
while the economy has been growing.
Obviously that is not including

538
00:17:15.444 --> 00:17:16.403
Obviously that is not including
aviation, shipping, which people are

539
00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:16.819
aviation, shipping, which peopla are
keen on

540
00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.319
aviation, shipping, which people are
keen on pointing out. Just in terms

541
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:19.736
keen on pointing out. just in terms
of what

542
00:17:19.736 --> 00:17:22.819
keen on pointing out. Just in terms
of what the figure actually means.

543
00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.069
of what the figure actually means.
We are making huge on switching from

544
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.736
We are making huge on switching from
fossil fuels to having a significant

545
00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:29.153
fossil fuels to having a significant
part of our energy from renewables.

546
00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:30.153
part of our energy from renewablas.
And

547
00:17:30.153 --> 00:17:31.528
part of our energy from renewables.
And we have got huge, ambitious

548
00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:34.153
And we have got huge, ambitious
plans. The gentleman up there said

549
00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:39.736
plans. The gentleman up there said
2050 is not soon enough. Absolutely,

550
00:17:39.736 --> 00:17:41.444
2050 is not soon enough. Absolutely,
I am totally alive and worried

551
00:17:41.444 --> 00:17:43.569
I am totally alive and worried
myself to the climate change crisis.

552
00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:45.736
myself to the climate change crisis.
Do you think it is not soon enough

553
00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:48.361
Do you think it is not soon enough
as well? Well, we are the first

554
00:17:48.361 --> 00:17:51.319
as well? Well, we are the first
major economy to even be setting an

555
00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:53.111
major economy to even be setting an
ambition of 2050. Let’s realise that

556
00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:54.361
ambition of 2050. Let’s realise that
that is quite a substantial

557
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.694
that is quite a substantial
ambition, to be leading the world on

558
00:17:55.694 --> 00:17:58.403
ambition, to be leading the world on
that. To the gentleman who suggested

559
00:17:58.403 --> 00:18:00.278
that. To the gentleman who suggested
we should choose a camp, I don’t

560
00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:00.819
we should choose a ramp, I don’t
think we

561
00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:02.694
we should choose a camp, I don’t
think we should choose a camp, I

562
00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:03.528
think we should choose a ramp, I
think we

563
00:18:03.528 --> 00:18:04.569
think we should choose a camp, I
think we should do both. So, we

564
00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:07.403
think we should do both. So, we
should continue to aim for growth,

565
00:18:07.403 --> 00:18:09.736
should continue to aim for growth,
we should be ambitious about growth

566
00:18:09.736 --> 00:18:11.611
we should be ambitious about growth
and Green growth and we should

567
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:15.153
and Green growth and we should
achieve growth hand—in—hand with

568
00:18:15.153 --> 00:18:15.903
achieve growth hand-in-hand with
making sure

569
00:18:15.903 --> 00:18:17.153
achieve growth hand—in—hand with
making sure that we reduce our

570
00:18:17.153 --> 00:18:18.569
making sure that we reduce our
emissions, we go carbon neutral by

571
00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:20.069
emissions, we go carbon neutral by
2050 and we leave the environment in

572
00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:22.569
2050 and we leave the environment in
a better state than it was when we

573
00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:24.194
a better state than it was when we
inherited it. I

574
00:18:24.194 --> 00:18:24.569
a better state than it was when we
inherited it. lam

575
00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:25.111
a better state than it was when we
inherited it. I am going to take

576
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:26.361
inherited it. I am going to take
another question, before I do, I

577
00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:26.528
inherited it. I am going to take
another question, before I do, I

578
00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:28.611
another question, before I do, I
just want to tell you that we will

579
00:18:28.611 --> 00:18:30.194
just want to tell you that we will
be in Stoke Newington in London next

580
00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:31.944
be in Stoke Newington in London next
week and the week after that, we

581
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.778
week and the week after that, we
will be in Buxton, so if you would

582
00:18:34.778 --> 00:18:36.278
will be in Buxton, so if you would
like to be in the audience, call

583
00:18:36.278 --> 00:18:36.444
will be in Buxton, so if you would
like to be in the audience, callus

584
00:18:36.444 --> 00:18:38.153
like to be in the audience, all us
on... Or you ran go

585
00:18:38.153 --> 00:18:38.736
like to be in the audience, callus
on... Or you can go to the Question

586
00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:39.153
on... Or you ran go to the Question
Time

587
00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:39.986
on... Or you can go to the Question
Time website and follow the

588
00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:41.403
Time website and follow the
instructions there. Let’s take our

589
00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:41.653
instmctions there. Let’s take our
second

590
00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:46.611
instructions there. Let’s take our
second question.

591
00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:54.778
second question. Should the Sussexes
profit from their royal status? Is

592
00:18:54.778 --> 00:18:57.153
profit from their royal status? Is
that what you think they may end up

593
00:18:57.153 --> 00:18:58.819
that what you think they may end up
doing? I

594
00:18:58.819 --> 00:18:58.944
that what you think they may end up
doing? Ithink

595
00:18:58.944 --> 00:18:59.861
that what you think they may end up
doing? I think most likely it is

596
00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:02.028
doing? I think most likely it is
what they may end up doing, to be

597
00:19:02.028 --> 00:19:04.986
what they may end up doing, to be
honest. We have already seen them

598
00:19:04.986 --> 00:19:06.153
honest. We have already seen them
trademark their Sussex name, and I

599
00:19:06.153 --> 00:19:08.278
trademark their Sussex name, and I
think it is highly unlikely that

600
00:19:08.278 --> 00:19:10.194
think it is highly unlikely that
they will not continue to carry on

601
00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:14.444
they will not continue to carry on
this trend. Laurence Fox, what is

602
00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:20.361
this trend. Laurence Fox, what is
your view on it all? I feel sorry

603
00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:24.153
your view on it all? I feel sorry
for them, in a way. Because it is

604
00:19:24.153 --> 00:19:25.569
for them, in a way. Because it is
difficult when you’ve got a new baby

605
00:19:25.569 --> 00:19:29.736
difficult when you’ve got a new baby
and all of that, and it is hard, but

606
00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:29.944
and all of that, and it is hard, but
I

607
00:19:29.944 --> 00:19:30.528
and all of that, and it is hard, but
Ijust have

608
00:19:30.528 --> 00:19:30.944
and all of that, and it is hard, but
I just have this feeling,

609
00:19:30.944 --> 00:19:31.028
and all of that, and it is hard, but
Ijust have this feeling, surely

610
00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:34.736
Ijust have this feeling, surely
Harry must have had a chat to Meghan

611
00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:36.986
Harry must have had a chat to Meghan
at some point and said, by the way,

612
00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:37.986
at some point and said, by the way,
darting, this is

613
00:19:37.986 --> 00:19:38.861
at some point and said, by the way,
darling, this is going to be misery,

614
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:39.361
darting, this is going to be misery,
and you don’t

615
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:40.403
darling, this is going to be misery,
and you don’t have to marry me if

616
00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:44.319
and you don’t have to marry me if
you don’t want to. Maybe they did!

617
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:46.611
you don’t want to. Maybe they did!
May be they did, and then, you want

618
00:19:46.611 --> 00:19:48.444
May be they did, and then, you want
to hop out, it is, like, can we have

619
00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:53.403
to hop out, it is, like, ran we have
the

620
00:19:53.903 --> 00:19:55.444
the cottage back and your HRHs? So,
you think

621
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:55.653
the cottage hack and your HRHs? So,
you think they

622
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.569
the cottage back and your HRHs? So,
you think they are doing the wrong

623
00:19:56.569 --> 00:19:58.153
you think they are doing the wrong
thing, you think it is

624
00:19:58.153 --> 00:20:00.486
thing, you think it is
disrespectful? I think it is really

625
00:20:00.486 --> 00:20:02.944
disrespectful? I think it is really
unfair, because we’ve got the Queen,

626
00:20:02.944 --> 00:20:04.528
unfair, because we’ve got the Queen,
who is an extremely different ball

627
00:20:04.528 --> 00:20:06.153
who is an extremely different ball
game, she is duty ahead of

628
00:20:06.153 --> 00:20:07.319
game, she is duty ahead of
everything else, and when you’re

629
00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:09.278
everything else, and when you’re
younger, you do want to make a life

630
00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:09.986
younger, you do want to make a life
or your family, so

631
00:20:09.986 --> 00:20:10.236
younger, you do want to make a life
or yourfamily, sol

632
00:20:10.236 --> 00:20:10.736
younger, you do want to make a life
or yourfamily, so I do emphasise

633
00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:11.319
or your family, so I do emphasise
with them,

634
00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:12.986
or yourfamily, so I do emphasise
with them, but I do think there is a

635
00:20:12.986 --> 00:20:14.653
with them, but I do think there is a
little bit of having cake and eating

636
00:20:14.653 --> 00:20:15.278
little bit of having rake and eating
it, which I

637
00:20:15.278 --> 00:20:18.736
little bit of having cake and eating
it, which I don’t enjoy. The problem

638
00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:20.986
it, which I don’t enjoy. The problem
we’ve got with this is that Meghan

639
00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.319
we’ve got with this is that Meghan
has agreed to be Harry’s wife and

640
00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:23.861
has agreed to be Harrrs wife and
then the

641
00:20:23.861 --> 00:20:24.819
has agreed to be Harry’s wife and
then the press have torn her to

642
00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:32.319
then the press have torn her to
pieces. That’s what they did. Let’s

643
00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:34.194
pieces. That’s what they did. Let’s
be really clear about what this is,

644
00:20:34.194 --> 00:20:35.236
be really clear about what this is,
let’s all

645
00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:35.528
be really clear about what this is,
let’s call it

646
00:20:35.528 --> 00:20:35.694
be really clear about what this is,
let’s all it by

647
00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:36.486
be really clear about what this is,
let’s call it by its name, it’s

648
00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:37.278
let’s all it by its name, it’s
racism.

649
00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.528
let’s call it by its name, it’s
racism. She is a black woman and

650
00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:40.986
racism. She is a black woman and
she’s been in... It’s not racism,

651
00:20:40.986 --> 00:20:42.653
she’s been in... It’s not racism,
you can’t... She has been torn to

652
00:20:42.653 --> 00:20:47.069
you can’t... She has been torn to
pieces. No, it’s not. We are the

653
00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:48.069
pieces. No, it’s not. We are the
most tolerant, lovely country in

654
00:20:48.069 --> 00:20:53.694
most tolerant, lovely country in
Europe. It is so easy to throw the

655
00:20:53.694 --> 00:20:55.236
Europe. It is so easy to throw the
card of racism at everybody and it

656
00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:58.528
card of racism at everybody and it
is getting boring. You are a white

657
00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:01.486
is getting boring. You are a white
privileged male who has... Can I

658
00:21:01.486 --> 00:21:03.194
privileged male who has... (“an I
just...? I

659
00:21:03.194 --> 00:21:04.069
privileged male who has... (“an I
just...? Iran’t

660
00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:05.528
privileged male who has... Can I
just...? I can’t help what I am, I

661
00:21:05.528 --> 00:21:08.569
just...? I can’t help what I am, I
was born like this, it is an

662
00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:10.194
was born like this, it is an
immutable characteristic, so to call

663
00:21:10.194 --> 00:21:11.694
immutable characteristic, so to call
me a white privileged male is to be

664
00:21:11.694 --> 00:21:16.278
me a white privileged male is to be
racist. You’re being racist. I am

665
00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:17.278
racist. You’re being racist. lam
not taking a

666
00:21:17.278 --> 00:21:18.403
racist. You’re being racist. I am
not taking a view either way, I will

667
00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.653
not taking a view either way, I will
just add in that Priti Patel, the

668
00:21:20.653 --> 00:21:21.944
just add in that Priti Patel, the
Home Secretary, also took the view

669
00:21:21.944 --> 00:21:24.111
Home Secretary, also took the view
that it was not racism, I am not

670
00:21:24.111 --> 00:21:26.319
that it was not racism, I am not
making a judgment on that. The woman

671
00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:28.528
making a judgment on that. The woman
in the red top, you were nodding

672
00:21:28.528 --> 00:21:29.819
in the red top, you were nodding
your head vigourously, what have you

673
00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:32.903
your head vigourously, what have you
got to say? I think when Meghan

674
00:21:32.903 --> 00:21:34.028
got to say? I think when Meghan
first married Harry, I thought it

675
00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:34.486
first married Harry, Ithought it
was a

676
00:21:34.486 --> 00:21:35.986
first married Harry, I thought it
was a breath of fresh air, I thought

677
00:21:35.986 --> 00:21:38.694
was a breath of fresh air, I thought
it was good. I thought it was nice

678
00:21:38.694 --> 00:21:41.944
it was good. I thought it was nice
to have somebody like her, who was

679
00:21:41.944 --> 00:21:44.236
to have somebody like her, who was
not a royal, she came from America,

680
00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:45.694
not a royal, she came from America,
she came from an ordinary

681
00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:47.069
she came from an ordinary
background, I thought that was all

682
00:21:47.069 --> 00:21:50.528
background, I thought that was all
great. But I think that she’s

683
00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:50.694
great. But I think that she’s
actually

684
00:21:50.694 --> 00:21:52.194
great. But I think that she’s
actuallyjoined a club and now she

685
00:21:52.194 --> 00:21:52.569
actually joined a club and now she
just doesn’t

686
00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:54.569
actuallyjoined a club and now she
just doesn’t the rules. And she

687
00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:55.194
just doesn’t the mles. And she
wants to opt

688
00:21:55.194 --> 00:21:59.486
just doesn’t the rules. And she
wants to opt out. And as Laurence

689
00:21:59.486 --> 00:21:59.944
wants to opt out. And as Laurence
said, I

690
00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:00.319
wants to opt out. And as Laurence
said, Ithink

691
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.028
wants to opt out. And as Laurence
said, I think surely she must have

692
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.194
said, I think surely she must have
realised... She is an intelligent

693
00:22:03.194 --> 00:22:04.486
realised... She is an intelligent
woman, she must have realised some

694
00:22:04.486 --> 00:22:07.694
woman, she must have realised some
of what was going to happen. But it

695
00:22:07.694 --> 00:22:10.278
of what was going to happen. But it
might be Harry who is driving this?

696
00:22:10.278 --> 00:22:12.111
might be Harry who is driving this?
It might be but it seems to be that

697
00:22:12.111 --> 00:22:14.361
It might be but it seems to be that
it is Meghan, I don’t know. We can

698
00:22:14.361 --> 00:22:15.194
it is Meghan, I don’t know. We ran
only speak you

699
00:22:15.194 --> 00:22:17.736
it is Meghan, I don’t know. We can
only speak you late. What is your

700
00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:18.319
only speak you late. what is your
take on this,

701
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:22.444
only speak you late. What is your
take on this, Shami? I think you’ve

702
00:22:22.444 --> 00:22:24.736
take on this, Shami? I think you’ve
got to walk around in someone else’s

703
00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:27.736
got to walk around in someone else’s
shoes. I know that to be royalty is

704
00:22:27.736 --> 00:22:30.194
shoes. I know that to be royalty is
not to be the worst off person in

705
00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:32.069
not to be the worst off person in
the country or the planet but I

706
00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:33.736
the country or the planet but I
still try to walk around in someone

707
00:22:33.736 --> 00:22:35.736
still try to walk around in someone
else’s shoes and I do think that

708
00:22:35.736 --> 00:22:37.944
else’s shoes and I do think that
some of the things that are being

709
00:22:37.944 --> 00:22:39.611
some of the things that are being
said are pretty harsh, and I would

710
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:42.861
said are pretty harsh, and I would
never say that because you’re a

711
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.528
never say that because you’re a
white man, you don’t have a

712
00:22:44.528 --> 00:22:46.486
white man, you don’t have a
perspective, but I would ask you to

713
00:22:46.486 --> 00:22:48.694
perspective, but I would ask you to
consider the perspective of anybody

714
00:22:48.694 --> 00:22:50.486
consider the perspective of anybody
who has had a different experience.

715
00:22:50.486 --> 00:22:52.778
who has had a different experience.
And I know that Britain is a

716
00:22:52.778 --> 00:22:54.069
And I know that Britain is a
wonderful country, and I am second

717
00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:56.236
wonderful country, and I am second
to no one in my love of my country,

718
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:57.986
to no one in my love of my country,
but loving your country doesn’t mean

719
00:22:57.986 --> 00:23:00.111
but loving your country doesn’t mean
that you say there is no racism in

720
00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:01.903
that you say there is no racism in
the country. And there are no issues

721
00:23:01.903 --> 00:23:07.236
the country. And there are no issues
in the press. Forgive me... I think

722
00:23:07.236 --> 00:23:08.403
in the press. Forgive me... I think
in this city perhaps more than

723
00:23:08.403 --> 00:23:12.986
in this city perhaps more than
anywhere else in this country, you

724
00:23:12.986 --> 00:23:16.819
anywhere else in this country, you
know about abuses by parts of the

725
00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:22.444
know about abuses by parts of the
press, and I...

726
00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:25.028
press, and I... And if we want to be

727
00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:25.736
press, and I... And ifwe wantto be
specific and look

728
00:23:25.736 --> 00:23:26.278
press, and I... And if we want to be
specific and look at evidence, there

729
00:23:26.278 --> 00:23:28.319
specific and look at evidence, there
was a piece I think it was in

730
00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:30.944
was a piece I think it was in
Buzzfeed today, where there was a

731
00:23:30.944 --> 00:23:31.278
Bunfeed today, where there was a
very, very

732
00:23:31.278 --> 00:23:31.819
Buzzfeed today, where there was a
very, very forensic comparison

733
00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:34.861
very, very forensic comparison
between the treatment of the two

734
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:37.403
between the treatment of the two
princes... Shall I quote? This is

735
00:23:37.403 --> 00:23:39.194
princes... Shall I quote? This is
the Daily Express, so, the Daily

736
00:23:39.194 --> 00:23:40.778

said, in

00:23:43.403 --> 00:23:44.653
choosing flowers and in August they
said, in 2011, this was for the

740
00:23:44.653 --> 00:23:46.319
said, in 2011, this was for the
wedding, the bride herself, the

741
00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:47.903
wedding, the bride herself, the
bouquet, was effortlessly elegant

742
00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:48.111
bouquet, was eﬂorﬂassly elagant
and

743
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.653
bouquet, was effortlessly elegant
and understated. Then the Daily

744
00:23:51.653 --> 00:23:52.611
and understated. Then the Daily
Express on Meghan choosing flowers

745
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:54.194
Express on Meghan choosing ﬂowers
for her

Express on Meghan choosing flowers
for her wedding, how Meghan Markle’s

747
00:23:56.861 --> 00:23:57.319
for her wedding, how Meghan Markle’s
ﬂowers might

748
00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:57.944
for her wedding, how Meghan Markle’s
flowers might have put Princess

749
00:23:57.944 --> 00:23:58.111
ﬂowers might have put Princess
Margaret’s

750
00:23:58.111 --> 00:24:00.694
flowers might have put Princess
Margaret’s life at risk. I am not

751
00:24:00.694 --> 00:24:01.819
Margaret’s life at risk. I am not
saying that represent the Daily

752
00:24:01.819 --> 00:24:03.986
saying that represent the Daily
Express’s perspective. And it

753
00:24:03.986 --> 00:24:04.528
saying that represent the Daily
Express’s perspective. And it goes

754
00:24:04.528 --> 00:24:05.236
Express’s perspective. And it goes
on and it goes

755
00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:06.694
Express’s perspective. And it goes
on and it goes on and one is

756
00:24:06.694 --> 00:24:08.903
on and it goes on and one is
touching their bump to much,

757
00:24:08.903 --> 00:24:10.694
touching their bump to much,
avocados are good, and avocados

758
00:24:10.694 --> 00:24:12.986
avocados are good, and avocados
are... It is so forensically done.

759
00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:14.028
are... It is so forensic-ally done.
And it’s not just

760
00:24:14.028 --> 00:24:15.278
are... It is so forensically done.
And it’s notjust the press. I am

761
00:24:15.278 --> 00:24:15.694
And it’s not just the press. I am
not on

762
00:24:15.694 --> 00:24:17.569
And it’s notjust the press. I am
not on social media because I am a

763
00:24:17.569 --> 00:24:19.319
not on social media because I am a
dinosaur, but also I am not on it

764
00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:21.694
dinosaur, but also I am not on it
because some of it is so awful. And

765
00:24:21.694 --> 00:24:26.278
because some of it is so awful. And
forgive me, I do think that the

766
00:24:26.278 --> 00:24:28.444
forgive me, I do think that the
Duchess of Sussex has had some

767
00:24:28.444 --> 00:24:29.694
Duchess of Sussex has had some
really rough treatment. The question

768
00:24:29.694 --> 00:24:32.319
really rough treatment. The question
was, is it right that they should

769
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:34.236
was, is it right that they should
profit from their royal status of?

770
00:24:34.236 --> 00:24:34.444
profit from their royal stems of?
It’s

771
00:24:34.444 --> 00:24:36.153
profit from their royal status of?
It’s tricky, isn’t it, because we

772
00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:38.903
It’s tricky, isn’t it, because we
can’t have it both ways. If we say

773
00:24:38.903 --> 00:24:40.694
can’t have it both ways. If we say
we want a slimmed down Royal Family,

774
00:24:40.694 --> 00:24:42.153
we want a slimmed down Royal Family,
we want to spend less public money

775
00:24:42.153 --> 00:24:44.986
we want to spend less public money
on people who are not in the direct

776
00:24:44.986 --> 00:24:45.319
on peopla who are not in the direct
line of

777
00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:46.111
on people who are not in the direct
line of succession, et cetera, you

778
00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:47.319
line of succession, et cetera, you
ran say that on

779
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.153
line of succession, et cetera, you
can say that on the one hand, and

780
00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:48.778
ran say that on the one hand, and
then you say

781
00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:49.278
can say that on the one hand, and
then you say they should not

782
00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:49.944
then you say they should not
profit. . .

783
00:24:49.944 --> 00:24:52.653
then you say they should not
profit... Prince Harry cannot escape

784
00:24:52.653 --> 00:24:54.653
profit... Prince Harry cannot escape
his birth and his status, and part

785
00:24:54.653 --> 00:24:56.236
his birth and his status, and part
of that is a very, very tragic story

786
00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:59.778
of that is a very, very tragic story
about losing your mother when you’re

787
00:24:59.778 --> 00:25:01.444
about losing your mother when you’re
too young, I have some sympathy for

788
00:25:01.444 --> 00:25:03.153
too young, I have some sympathy for
that, I have some empathy for that

789
00:25:03.153 --> 00:25:06.153
that, I have some empathy for that
and I think we should just tone it

790
00:25:06.153 --> 00:25:07.778
and I think we should just tone it
down a little bit did you want to

791
00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:09.694
down a little bit did you want to
come back in? Yeah, I think it is

792
00:25:09.694 --> 00:25:10.361
come back in? Yeah, Ithink it is
one of the

793
00:25:10.361 --> 00:25:10.944
come back in? Yeah, I think it is
one of the dangerous things about

794
00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:11.861
one of the dangerous things about
throwing racism around in this

795
00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:14.528
throwing racism around in this
country, which we are doing a lot at

796
00:25:14.528 --> 00:25:15.861
country, which we are doing a lot at
the moment, is, people become so

797
00:25:15.861 --> 00:25:15.986
the moment, is, peopla become so
conscious

798
00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:18.986
the moment, is, people become so
conscious of it that things like the

799
00:25:18.986 --> 00:25:19.778
conscious of it that things like the
Manchester grooming scandal get

800
00:25:19.778 --> 00:25:22.819
Manchester grooming scandal get
ignored. So that we need to be

801
00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:24.403
ignored. So that we need to be
careful that we need to call out

802
00:25:24.403 --> 00:25:24.528
careful that we need to all out
racism

803
00:25:24.528 --> 00:25:25.944
careful that we need to call out
racism when it is seen and when it

804
00:25:25.944 --> 00:25:27.528
racism when it is seen and when it
is obvious and we should stand

805
00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:29.278
is obvious and we should stand
together to condemn it but for fear

806
00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:31.236
together to condemn it but for fear
of sounding racist, there has been

807
00:25:31.236 --> 00:25:32.819
of sounding racist, there has been
horrific things have happened in

808
00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:34.236
horrific things have happened in
Manchester and in towns all over the

809
00:25:34.236 --> 00:25:36.611
Manchester and in towns all over the
north of England and we should be

810
00:25:36.611 --> 00:25:38.194
north of England and we should be
careful and use racism when it is

811
00:25:38.194 --> 00:25:39.861
careful and use racism when it is
there an obvious and not call

812
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:40.236
there an obvious and not call
someone racist

813
00:25:40.236 --> 00:25:41.194
there an obvious and not call
someone racistjust because they

814
00:25:41.194 --> 00:25:41.569
someone racist just because they
don’t agree

815
00:25:41.569 --> 00:25:44.319
someone racistjust because they
don’t agree with you. So, coming

816
00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:48.319
don’t agree with you. So, coming
back to the question, when this

817
00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:52.069
back to the question, when this
story broke, Wednesday a week ago, I

818
00:25:52.069 --> 00:25:53.486
story broke, Wednesday a week ago, I
don’t think any of us could have

819
00:25:53.486 --> 00:25:55.069
don’t think any of us could have
foreseen how it was going to go, we

820
00:25:55.069 --> 00:25:58.319
foreseen how it was going to go, we
have now obviously got the Daily

821
00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:01.153
have now obviously got the Daily
Mail and the Mail on Sunday possibly

822
00:26:01.153 --> 00:26:01.319
Mail and the Mail on Sunday possibly
falling

823
00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:06.694
Mail and the Mail on Sunday possibly
calling Meghan Markle’s father, the

824
00:26:06.694 --> 00:26:07.153
falling Meghan Markle’s father, the
court case,

825
00:26:07.153 --> 00:26:08.528
calling Meghan Markle’s father, the
court case, the libel case, what is

826
00:26:08.528 --> 00:26:09.069
court rase, the libel rase, what is
your view on

827
00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:11.278
court case, the libel case, what is
your view on what is happening? I

828
00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:13.653
your view on what is happening? I
think it makes the UK look like it

829
00:26:13.653 --> 00:26:15.403
think it makes the UK look like it
has lost its marbles, forgive me. I

830
00:26:15.403 --> 00:26:17.986
has lost its marbles, forgive me. I
really struggle, with all of the

831
00:26:17.986 --> 00:26:18.153
really stmggle, with all of the
issues

832
00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:19.486
really struggle, with all of the
issues that are kicking about in the

833
00:26:19.486 --> 00:26:20.778
issues that are kicking about in the
world, to find any headspace for

834
00:26:20.778 --> 00:26:23.111
world, to find any headspace for
this whatsoever. I think the Royal

835
00:26:23.111 --> 00:26:26.319
this whatsoever. I think the Royal
Family has been... The press

836
00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:29.819
Family has been... The press
alternates with the Royals between

837
00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:31.403
alternates with the Royals between
complete sycophancy or sheer hatred.

838
00:26:31.403 --> 00:26:33.111
complete sycophancy or sheer hatred.
And we have seen it over the years

839
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:34.653
And we have seen it over the years
with each member of the Royal

840
00:26:34.653 --> 00:26:36.653
with each member of the Royal
Family. But there is an issue with

841
00:26:36.653 --> 00:26:37.736
Family. But there is an issue with
pub“:

842
00:26:37.736 --> 00:26:39.111
Family. But there is an issue with
public spending, it is not entirely

843
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:40.736
public spending, it is not entirely
frivolous. Security and what have

844
00:26:40.736 --> 00:26:44.111
frivolous. Security and what have
you. Of all the issues facing us, I

845
00:26:44.111 --> 00:26:45.611
you. Of all the issues facing us, I
don’t think this is the biggest one.

846
00:26:45.611 --> 00:26:47.444
don’t think this is the biggest one.
If they want to be private citizens,

847
00:26:47.444 --> 00:26:50.528
If they want to be private citizens,
good luck to them, I wish them well.

848
00:26:50.528 --> 00:26:51.819
good luck to them, I wish them well.
If they absolutely give up their

849
00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:54.361
If they absolutely give up their
right to public money when that

850
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:55.361
right to public money when that
happens, absolutely. But this isn’t

851
00:26:55.361 --> 00:26:56.778
happens, absolutely. But this isn’t
the issue we need to be talking

852
00:26:56.778 --> 00:27:00.694
the issue we need to be talking
about. Well, lots of people want to

853
00:27:00.694 --> 00:27:00.944
about. Well, lots of peopla want to
talk

854
00:27:00.944 --> 00:27:02.944
about. Well, lots of people want to
talk about it, and that is why we

855
00:27:02.944 --> 00:27:04.944
talk about it, and that is why we
are doing it. Lots of people want to

856
00:27:04.944 --> 00:27:05.028
are doing it. Lots of peopla want to
talk

857
00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:05.944
are doing it. Lots of people want to
talk about celebrity Love Island,

858
00:27:05.944 --> 00:27:08.028
talk about celebrity Love Island,
that doesn’t mean it’s important.

859
00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:10.111
that doesn’t mean it’s important.
Not in this room I am glad to say.

860
00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:12.486
Not in this room I am glad to say.
The racism is a bit more serious,

861
00:27:12.486 --> 00:27:14.361
The racism is a bit more serious,
the idea that there is no racism in

862
00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:16.611
the idea that there is no racism in
Britain is a serious issue. No one

863
00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:19.986
Britain is a serious issue. No one
said there is no racism. No doubt

864
00:27:19.986 --> 00:27:22.611
said there is no racism. No doubt
there has been a great deal of

865
00:27:22.611 --> 00:27:23.403
there has been a great deal of
racism directed against Meghan

866
00:27:23.403 --> 00:27:24.736
racism directed against Meghan
Markle from members of the public

867
00:27:24.736 --> 00:27:27.194
Markle from members of the public
and some sections of the press. But

868
00:27:27.194 --> 00:27:28.861
and some sections of the press. But
I think in general, what is really

869
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.486
I think in general, what is really
aggravating people isn’t the colour

870
00:27:30.486 --> 00:27:30.861
aggravating peopla isn’t the colour
of her

871
00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:32.069
aggravating people isn’t the colour
of her skin but it is the hypocrisy

872
00:27:32.069 --> 00:27:34.194
of her skin but it is the hypocrisy
that they have shown on many

873
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:35.944
that they have shown on many
occasions, even the way in which

874
00:27:35.944 --> 00:27:38.278
occasions, even the way in which
they want to exit the Royal Family

875
00:27:38.278 --> 00:27:40.569
they want to exit the Royal Family
is, they are not proposing to be,

876
00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:42.069
is, they are not proposing to be,
like, the Dutch Royal Family, where

877
00:27:42.069 --> 00:27:43.903
like, the Dutch Royal Family, where
you cycle to work and maintain a

878
00:27:43.903 --> 00:27:44.153
you cycle to work and maintain a
regular

879
00:27:44.153 --> 00:27:45.486
you cycle to work and maintain a
regularjob. What they

880
00:27:45.486 --> 00:27:45.903
you cycle to work and maintain a
regular job. What they are

881
00:27:45.903 --> 00:27:46.069
you cycle to work and maintain a
regularjob. What they are proposing

882
00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:46.944
regularjob. what they are proposing
is a strange

883
00:27:46.944 --> 00:27:47.694
regularjob. What they are proposing
is a strange hybrid where you retain

884
00:27:47.694 --> 00:27:49.486
is a strange hybrid where you retain
many of the perks and privileges of

885
00:27:49.486 --> 00:27:52.944
many of the perks and privileges of
being in the Royal Family, but you

886
00:27:52.944 --> 00:27:54.819
being in the Royal Family, but you
expect none of their duty. And to go

887
00:27:54.819 --> 00:27:55.986
expect none of their duty. And to go
back to the original question about,

888
00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:58.028
back to the original question about,
are we going to see them cashing in

889
00:27:58.028 --> 00:27:59.528
are we going to see them cashing in
on their browned? Yes, I think we

890
00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:03.236
on their browned? Yes, I think we
will. -- on

891
00:28:03.236 --> 00:28:04.444
on their browned? Yes, I think we
will. —— on their brand? I think we

892
00:28:04.444 --> 00:28:06.069
will. -- on their brand? I think we
are going to get a

893
00:28:06.069 --> 00:28:06.778
will. —— on their brand? I think we
are going to get a kind of woke

894
00:28:06.778 --> 00:28:08.486
are going to get a kind of woke
celebrity, bit of Kardashian thrown

895
00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:11.736
celebrity, bit of Kardashian thrown
in for good measure, type thing. You

896
00:28:11.736 --> 00:28:12.528
in for good measure, type thing. You
have painted an extraordinary

897
00:28:12.528 --> 00:28:15.653
have painted an extraordinary
vision! They say they want to avoid

898
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:17.153
vision! They say they want to avoid
press coverage but I think what they

899
00:28:17.153 --> 00:28:20.069
press coverage but I think what they
are hoping to achieve with this

900
00:28:20.069 --> 00:28:22.694
are hoping to achieve with this
brand is to exchange UK coverage for

901
00:28:22.694 --> 00:28:24.153
brand is to exchange UK coverage for
US coverage. I think the public

902
00:28:24.153 --> 00:28:25.569
US coverage. I think the public
empathises with their need to live a

903
00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:28.278
empathises with their need to live a
more private life, and there are

904
00:28:28.278 --> 00:28:29.653
more private life, and there are
days out of the Royal Family which

905
00:28:29.653 --> 00:28:31.528
days out of the Royal Family which
would enable them to do that, but

906
00:28:31.528 --> 00:28:31.861
would enabla them to do that, but
what therre

907
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:32.694
would enable them to do that, but
what they’re proposing is not a

908
00:28:32.694 --> 00:28:32.903
what therre proposing is not a
retreat

909
00:28:32.903 --> 00:28:34.736
what they’re proposing is not a
retreat from public life at all, I

910
00:28:34.736 --> 00:28:36.069
retreat from public life at all, I
think the hypocrisy in that is

911
00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:42.153
think the hypocrisy in that is
really annoying a lot of people.

912
00:28:44.319 --> 00:28:44.694
really annoying a lot of peopla.
Fergie got

913
00:28:44.694 --> 00:28:45.819
really annoying a lot of people.
Fergie got ten times worse press

914
00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:48.486
Fergie got ten times worse press
than Meghan has ever had. And as

915
00:28:48.486 --> 00:28:53.361
than Meghan has ever had. And as
soon the press say boo to Meghan, I

916
00:28:53.361 --> 00:28:56.069
soon the press say boo to Meghan, I
feel she pulls the racist card. I

917
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:58.319
feel she pulls the racist card. I
am, as she says, a woman of colour,

918
00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.319
am, as she says, a woman of colour,
and I feel she

919
00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:00.861
am, as she says, a woman of colour,
and Ifeel she pulls the racist card

920
00:29:00.861 --> 00:29:01.944
and I feel she pulls the racist card
every time,

921
00:29:01.944 --> 00:29:02.944
and Ifeel she pulls the racist card
every time, when there is something

922
00:29:02.944 --> 00:29:04.861
every time, when there is something
she doesn’t like, she is straight

923
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:07.486
she doesn’t like, she is straight
off with, it is racist. I’m not sure

924
00:29:07.486 --> 00:29:08.944

being family orientated...

937

vulnerable, but their priorities,

940
00:29:41.694 --> 00:29:44.736
vulnerable, but their priorities,
they didn’t even tell the Queen, and

941
00:29:44.736 --> 00:29:48.694
they didn’t even tell the Queen, and
they told, did they tell the media?

why didn’t they tell the Queen? You

948
00:29:56.653 --> 00:29:58.694
why didn’t they tell the Queen? You
tell your family first. They go on

949
00:29:58.694 --> 00:29:59.069

about their family, their child and

952
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:03.486
about their family, their child and
everything. Obviously, we don’t know

953
00:30:03.486 --> 00:30:05.153
everything. Obviously, we don’t know
if they didn’t tell the Queen or

954
00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:08.028
if they didn’t tell the Queen or
not, we are all circulating. Because

00:30:08.028 --> 00:30:09.194

00:30:19.611 --> 00:30:20.194
Helen. where there are questions of
racism, let’s just

961
00:30:20.194 --> 00:30:20.861
Helen. Where there are questions of
racism, let’s just continue to put

962
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:22.444
racism, let’s just continue to put
their message out there that it is

963
00:30:22.444 --> 00:30:24.486
their message out there that it is
not acceptable in our society, we

964
00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:25.861
not acceptable in our society, we
won’t tolerate it and we shouldn’t

965
00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:26.986
won’t tolerate it and we shouldn’t
tolerate it from members of the

966
00:30:26.986 --> 00:30:29.403

Royal Family. Do you think there is

967
00:30:29.403 --> 00:30:34.319
Royal Family. Do you think there is
racism? I’m sure that Meghan, like

racism? I’m sure that Meghan, like
others, have experienced racism. I

969
00:30:36.819 --> 00:30:38.653
others, have experienced racism. I
haven’t seen the analysis that you

970
00:30:38.653 --> 00:30:41.861
haven’t seen the analysis that you
went into, but let’s... What about

971
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:42.486
went into, but lat’s... what about
the original

972
00:30:42.486 --> 00:30:44.736
went into, but let’s... What about
the original question, should they

973
00:30:44.736 --> 00:30:46.278
the original question, should they
profit from their royal status? To

974
00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:46.611
profit from their royal stems? To
come

975
00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:47.653
profit from their royal status? To
come back to the overall point,

976
00:30:47.653 --> 00:30:48.986
come back to the overall point,
being a member of the Royal Family,

977
00:30:48.986 --> 00:30:52.236
being a member of the Royal Family,
there is dearty

978
00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:52.611
being a member of the Royal Family,
there is clearly great material

980
00:30:52.861 --> 00:30:53.861
there is clearly great material

not that much of my life is in the

990
00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:06.278

really tough, and a huge number of

991
00:31:06.278 --> 00:31:07.528
really tough, and a huge number of
duties associated with it and you

992

duties associated with it and you
don’t get to make all your own

993
00:31:08.986 --> 00:31:11.361
don’t get to make all your own
choices and I have huge respect for

994
00:31:11.361 --> 00:31:12.486
choices and I have huge respect for
the Royal Family, huge respect for

995
00:31:12.486 --> 00:31:14.111
the Royal Family, huge respect for
the Queen, and it is a shame that

996
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:15.486
the Queen, and it is a shame that
this is being played out so publicly

997
00:31:15.486 --> 00:31:18.986
this is being played out so publicly
but I hope they will be able to come

998
00:31:18.986 --> 00:31:20.861
but I hope they will be able to come
to a conclusion and move on, and

about a family of multimillionaires
who exist on state subsidies

Well, the only reason we asked the

1009
00:31:47.569 --> 00:31:50.069
Well, the only reason we asked the
question was because so many from

the audience wanted to discuss it,

1011
00:31:51.653 --> 00:31:53.361
the audience wanted to discuss it,
but I was about to move on. Shall we

but I was about to move on. Shall we
do that? We are simply reflecting

by 63%, is quite a lot. Several
hundred million, I think. 50 what is

1231
00:37:45.944 --> 00:37:46.278
hundred million, Ithink. So what is
the Tory

1232
00:37:46.278 --> 00:37:50.028
hundred million, I think. 50 what is
the Tory government going to do for

1233
00:37:50.028 --> 00:37:52.986
the Tory government going to do for
cities like Liverpool? Well, the

1234
00:37:52.986 --> 00:37:54.069
cities like Liverpool? Well, the
first thing that might provide you

1235
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:55.236
first thing that might provide you
with some reassurance is that this

1236
00:37:55.236 --> 00:37:56.903
with some reassurance is that this
is my second visit to Liverpool

1237
00:37:56.903 --> 00:38:03.486
is my second visit to Liverpool
within a week. They want more than

1238
00:38:03.486 --> 00:38:04.528
within a week. They want more than
visits! I mean, that’s lovely...

1239
00:38:04.528 --> 00:38:06.861
visits! I mean, that’s lovely...
APPLAUSE

1240
00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:11.028
APPLAUSE
Something to actually happen! Your

1241
00:38:11.028 --> 00:38:14.028
Something to actually happen! Your
time is limited, and I think it was

1242
00:38:14.028 --> 00:38:15.903
time is limited, and I think it was
my first visit since the election

1243
00:38:15.903 --> 00:38:16.444
my first visit since the elaction
and I

1244
00:38:16.444 --> 00:38:17.903
my first visit since the election
and I chose it to be to Liverpool,

1245
00:38:17.903 --> 00:38:20.278
and I chose it to be to Liverpool,
because it is important step someone

1246
00:38:20.278 --> 00:38:24.694
because it is important step someone
just shouted out, do you need a map?

just shouted out, do you need a map?
of

1248
00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:27.111
just shouted out, do you need a map?
Of my own view unlivable is it’s a

00:38:27.111 --> 00:38:30.486
Of my own view unlivable is it’s a
fantastic city, and had a fantastic

SOME LAUGHTER IN AUDIENCE.
It’s a moment to get excited and

1264
00:39:00.819 --> 00:39:02.194
It’s a moment to get excited and
grasp the opportunity to stop the

1265
00:39:02.194 --> 00:39:03.736
grasp the opportunity to stop the
honour in a to invest and we are

1266
00:39:03.736 --> 00:39:05.778
honour in a to invest and we are
determined to invest in

1267
00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:06.986
determined to invest in
infrastructure, and significant

1268
00:39:06.986 --> 00:39:07.194
infrastructure, and significa nt
direction

1269
00:39:07.194 --> 00:39:09.486
infrastructure, and significant
direction of travel travel for that

1270
00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:12.861
direction of travel travel for that
is new infrastructure connecting the

1271
00:39:12.861 --> 00:39:13.236
is new infrastmcture connecting the
north cities,

1272
00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:14.236
is new infrastructure connecting the
north cities, so you can get between

1273
00:39:14.236 --> 00:39:14.861
north cities, so you ran get between
them and get

1274
00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:15.861
north cities, so you can get between
them and get some of the benefits of

1275
00:39:15.861 --> 00:39:19.069
them and get some of the benefits of
being like one larger sister, so we

1276
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:20.903

will be investing in infrastructure

1277

will be investing in infrastmclure
and public

1278
00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:22.236
will be investing in infrastructure
and public services. We know the NHS

1279
00:39:22.236 --> 00:39:22.736
and public services. We know the NHS
is stmggling

1280
00:39:22.736 --> 00:39:23.569
and public services. We know the NHS
is struggling with the level of

1281
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.153
is struggling with the level of
demand and we were put in an

1282
00:39:25.153 --> 00:39:28.486
demand and we were put in an
increase of funding of £34 billion.

1283
00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:33.028
increase of funding of £34 billion.
We will invest in schools. We are

1284
00:39:33.028 --> 00:39:34.069
We will invest in schools. We are
doing fantastic stuff for the

1285
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:35.278
doing fantastic stuff for the
country and making sure there is

1286
00:39:35.278 --> 00:39:37.236
country and making sure there is
more money in your pocket. 50

1287
00:39:37.236 --> 00:39:37.403
country and making sure there is
more money in your pocket. So let’s

1288
00:39:37.403 --> 00:39:40.819
more money in your pocket. So let’s
get excited about it! There is quite

1289
00:39:40.819 --> 00:39:44.569
get excited about it! There is quite
a lot of laughter. I mean, there are

1290
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:47.486
a lot of laughter. I mean, there are
a lot of people in this audience who

1291
00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:48.444
a lot of people in this audience who
voted Conservative, but there are

1292
00:39:48.444 --> 00:39:48.694
voted Conservative, but there are
dearty

1293
00:39:48.694 --> 00:39:49.486
voted Conservative, but there are
clearly people here who voted

1294
00:39:49.486 --> 00:39:52.528
clearly people here who voted
Labour. They are laughing, and not

1295
00:39:52.528 --> 00:39:54.819
Labour. They are laughing, and not
very excited. Give the people here

1296
00:39:54.819 --> 00:40:00.236
very excited. Give the people here
one thing that they can get excited

1297
00:40:00.236 --> 00:40:01.111
one thing that they ran get excited
about, say,

1298
00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:02.528
one thing that they can get excited
about, say, OK, the Conservatives

1299
00:40:02.528 --> 00:40:03.944
about, say, OK, the Conservatives
are in government, this is one thing

1300
00:40:03.944 --> 00:40:06.694
are in government, this is one thing
to watch for. If you are somebody on

1301
00:40:06.694 --> 00:40:09.319
to watch for. If you are somebody on
a lower income, we are determined

1302
00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:11.694
a lower income, we are determined
that your income will go up. For

1303
00:40:11.694 --> 00:40:12.819
that your income will go up. For
instance, we are increasing the

1304
00:40:12.819 --> 00:40:14.444
instance, we are increasing the
national living wage, which will be

1305
00:40:14.444 --> 00:40:18.153
national living wage, which will be
over £10 an hour in this Parliament,

1306
00:40:18.153 --> 00:40:19.319
over £10 an hour in this Partiament,
and we are raising

1307
00:40:19.319 --> 00:40:20.278
over £10 an hour in this Parliament,
and we are raising the threshold on

1308
00:40:20.278 --> 00:40:21.444
and we are raising the threshold on
national insurance, so it’s about

1309
00:40:21.444 --> 00:40:22.819
national insurance, so it’s about
having more money in your pocket,

1310
00:40:22.819 --> 00:40:25.069
having more money in your pocket,
and that goes hand in hand with our

1311
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.694
and that goes hand in hand with our
strong record on

1312
00:40:25.694 --> 00:40:26.486
and that goes hand in hand with our
strong record onjobs, so you are

1313
00:40:26.486 --> 00:40:27.569
strong record on jobs, so you are
more likely to

1314
00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:28.528
strong record onjobs, so you are
more likely to be in a job, earning

1315
00:40:28.528 --> 00:40:30.986
more likely to be in a job, earning
more and having more money in your

1316
00:40:30.986 --> 00:40:33.236
more and having more money in your
pocket. Isn’t that a good thing? The

1317
00:40:33.236 --> 00:40:36.236
pocket. Isn’t that a good thing? The
woman in the blacktop. I appreciate

1318
00:40:36.236 --> 00:40:41.111
woman in the blacktop. I appreciate
your comments on the national

1319
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:42.486
your comments on the national
infrastructure and the national

1320
00:40:42.486 --> 00:40:42.903
infrastmclure and the national
living wage,

1321
00:40:42.903 --> 00:40:43.903
infrastructure and the national
living wage, but with two thirds of

1322
00:40:43.903 --> 00:40:45.236
living wage, but with two thirds of
children under the poverty line, why

1323
00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:47.611
children under the poverty line, why
are you not helping the actual

1324
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.569
are you not helping the actual
peopla why

1325
00:40:48.569 --> 00:40:49.486
are you not helping the actual
people why not make a difference in

1326
00:40:49.486 --> 00:40:53.403
people why not make a difference in
peoples lives? We can build more

1327
00:40:53.403 --> 00:40:53.736
peoplas lives? We ran build more
student

1328
00:40:53.736 --> 00:40:55.069
peoples lives? We can build more
student accommodation at a wonderful

1329
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:56.569
student accommodation at a wonderful
things on the docks but, if people

1330
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.694
things on the docks but, if peopla
can’t

1331
00:40:56.694 --> 00:40:58.778
things on the docks but, if people
can’t afford to eat, these are the

1332
00:40:58.778 --> 00:41:00.194
can’t afford to eat, these are the
important things in our country, in

1333
00:41:00.194 --> 00:41:03.069
important things in our country, in
my opinion. The woman at the top

1334
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:07.986
my opinion. The woman at the top
with the long hair. Talking about

1335
00:41:07.986 --> 00:41:09.236
with the long hair. Talking about
transport and things, I have been

1336
00:41:09.236 --> 00:41:11.278
transport and things, I have been
travelling from Manchester to

1337
00:41:11.278 --> 00:41:12.319
travelling from Manchester to
Liverpool since December last year

1338
00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:14.444
Liverpool since December last year
and I can’t tell you the amount of

1339
00:41:14.444 --> 00:41:17.944
and I can’t tell you the amount of
overcrowding on those trains, and I

1340
00:41:17.944 --> 00:41:23.236
overcrowding on those trains, and I
just think I can’t believe these are

1341
00:41:23.236 --> 00:41:24.486
just think I can’t believe these are
two massive cities in the north—west

1342
00:41:24.486 --> 00:41:25.694
two massive cities in the north-west
and they are not

1343
00:41:25.694 --> 00:41:26.278
two massive cities in the north—west
and they are not well linked, and

1344
00:41:26.278 --> 00:41:29.736
and they are not well linked, and
that means to change. Tonga I agree,

1345
00:41:29.736 --> 00:41:32.111
that means to change. Tonga I agree,
the connections are not good enough.

1346
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:34.069
the connections are not good enough.
That is why we need to do that and

1347
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:39.361
That is why we need to do that and
invest. Whatever schemes, the

1348
00:41:39.361 --> 00:41:41.736
invest. Whatever schemes, the
ambition to connect up the cities of

1349
00:41:41.736 --> 00:41:42.778
ambition to connect up the cities of
the north, including Liverpool to

1350
00:41:42.778 --> 00:41:46.028
the north, including Liverpool to
Manchester, absolutely. I would love

1351
00:41:46.028 --> 00:41:46.486
Manchester, absolutely. Iwould love
to see

1352
00:41:46.486 --> 00:41:47.694
Manchester, absolutely. I would love
to see that change, but it doesn’t

1353
00:41:47.694 --> 00:41:51.028
to see that change, but it doesn’t
seem to be happening. It doesn’t

1354
00:41:51.028 --> 00:41:52.861
seem to be happening. It doesn’t
happen overnight, but you absolutely

1355
00:41:52.861 --> 00:41:54.736
happen overnight, but you absolutely
have to do it. I don’t want to go

1356
00:41:54.736 --> 00:41:56.111
have to do it. I don’t want to go
back over old ground, but the

1357
00:41:56.111 --> 00:41:57.486
back over old ground, but the
finances of the country were not in

1358
00:41:57.486 --> 00:41:59.403
finances of the country were not in
such a good state ten years ago, but

1359
00:41:59.403 --> 00:41:59.986
such a good state ten years ago, but
now we ran

1360
00:41:59.986 --> 00:42:05.403
such a good state ten years ago, but
now we can invest in infrastructure.

1361
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:09.069
now we ran invest in infrastmclure.
It’s bad, it’s got

1362
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:10.736
now we can invest in infrastructure.
It’s bad, it’s got to get better,

1363
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.653
It’s bad, it’s got to get better,
absolutely. Plan to look at what is

1364
00:42:12.653 --> 00:42:13.944
absolutely. Plan to look at what is
your view,

1365
00:42:13.944 --> 00:42:18.903
absolutely. Plan to look at what is
yourview, Laurence

1366
00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:19.944
your view, Laurence there have been

1367
00:42:19.944 --> 00:42:20.361
your view, laurence there have been
many news

1368
00:42:20.361 --> 00:42:22.361
your view, Laurence there have been
many news items about the state of

1369
00:42:22.361 --> 00:42:23.778
many news items about the state of
the railways, but in terms of what

1370
00:42:23.778 --> 00:42:24.986
the railways, but in terms of what
the north can expect from a

1371
00:42:24.986 --> 00:42:28.111
the north can expect from a
Conservative government? I am not a

1372
00:42:28.111 --> 00:42:29.403
Conservative government? I am not a
politician but I don’t at all

1373
00:42:29.403 --> 00:42:31.278
politician but I don’t at all
resonate with what he said

1374
00:42:31.278 --> 00:42:33.236
resonate with what he said
Liverpudlians being victims. I’ve

1375
00:42:33.236 --> 00:42:35.069
Liverpudlians being victims. I’ve
worked here a couple of times and,

1376
00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:38.486
worked here a couple of times and,
like most cities in the north, you

1377
00:42:38.486 --> 00:42:40.819
like most cities in the north, you
are so much nicer received by much

1378
00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:42.236
are so much nicer received by much
nicer people than you ever bump into

1379
00:42:42.236 --> 00:42:42.569
nicer peopla than you ever bump into
in London

1380
00:42:42.569 --> 00:42:42.778
nicer people than you ever bump into

Alyn. I think the question went to

1384
00:42:56.236 --> 00:42:57.319
Alyn. I think the question went to
the character of Boris

1385
00:42:57.319 --> 00:42:57.778
Alyn. I think the question went to
the character of BorisJohnson. The

1386
00:42:57.778 --> 00:42:58.111
the character of Boris johnson. The
words printed

1387
00:42:58.111 --> 00:43:00.319
the character of BorisJohnson. The
words printed in his newspaper,

1388
00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:01.653
words printed in his newspaper,
which he refused to apologise for

1389
00:43:01.653 --> 00:43:03.861
which he refused to apologise for
when Angela Eagle much more recently

1390

when Angela Eagla much more recently
asked

1391
00:43:04.111 --> 00:43:04.361
when Angela Eagle much more recently
asked him

1392
00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:04.528
when Angela Eagla much more recently
asked him to,

1393
00:43:04.528 --> 00:43:06.569
when Angela Eagle much more recently
asked him to, were gratuitously

1394
00:43:06.569 --> 00:43:07.819
asked him to, were gratuitously
offensive, and he dismisses it as

1395
00:43:07.819 --> 00:43:10.278
offensive, and he dismisses it as
banter. This is the man who said on

1396
00:43:10.278 --> 00:43:11.653
banter. This is the man who said on
the 31st October he’d rather die in

1397
00:43:11.653 --> 00:43:14.361
the 31st October he’d rather die in
a ditch and failed to deliver

1398
00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:15.236
a ditch and failed to deliver
Brexit, and then he was

1399
00:43:15.236 --> 00:43:15.486
a ditch and failed to deliver
Brexit, and then he wasjust

1400
00:43:15.486 --> 00:43:15.778
a ditch and failed to deliver
Brexit, and then he was just having

1401
00:43:15.778 --> 00:43:18.694
Brexit, and then he was just having
a laugh. My position of Boris

1402
00:43:18.694 --> 00:43:19.111
a laugh. My position of Boris
johnson is

1403
00:43:19.111 --> 00:43:20.111
a laugh. My position of Boris
Johnson is that the Tories are led

1404
00:43:20.111 --> 00:43:20.444
johnson is that the Tories are lad
by somebody

1405
00:43:20.444 --> 00:43:21.819
Johnson is that the Tories are led
by somebody who I think is unfit for

1406
00:43:21.819 --> 00:43:22.028
by somebody who I think is unfit for
pub“:

1407
00:43:22.028 --> 00:43:25.403
by somebody who I think is unfit for
public office. And, worse than that,

1408
00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:27.986
public office. And, worse than that,
it’s because this is a man who will

1409
00:43:27.986 --> 00:43:30.153
it’s because this is a man who will
say anything and promise anything,

1410
00:43:30.153 --> 00:43:32.069
say anything and promise anything,
and I think we need to

1411
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.944
say anything and promise anything,
and I think we need tojudge this

1412
00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:33.319
and I think we need to judge this
government

1413
00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:34.653
and I think we need tojudge this
government by its deeds, and I think

1414
00:43:34.653 --> 00:43:36.319
government by its deeds, and I think
politicians of all stripes need to

1415
00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:37.861
politicians of all stripes need to
work together to do our best to

1416
00:43:37.861 --> 00:43:39.403
work together to do our best to
mitigate what I think this

1417
00:43:39.403 --> 00:43:40.569
mitigate what I think this
government will do, because I think

1418
00:43:40.569 --> 00:43:43.111
government will do, because I think
there is bad stuff coming down the

1419
00:43:43.111 --> 00:43:44.361
there is bad stuff coming down the
line, not least coming through with

1420
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:47.569
line, not least coming through with
Brexit. You have had your hand up

1421
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:52.486
Brexit. You have had your hand up
for a long time, sir. If you are

1422
00:43:52.486 --> 00:43:53.861
for a long time, sir. If you are
wondering about the cynicism, it’s

1423
00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:55.319
wondering about the cynicism, it’s
because Liverpool was the hardest

1424
00:43:55.319 --> 00:43:57.444
because Liverpool was the hardest
hit and it came to central funding

1425
00:43:57.444 --> 00:43:59.444
hit and it came to central funding
cuts to local government, and it has

1426
00:43:59.444 --> 00:44:01.569
cuts to local government, and it has
devastated the city, in many

1427
00:44:01.569 --> 00:44:02.486
devastated the city, in many
respects, particularly those who are

1428
00:44:02.486 --> 00:44:02.611
respects, particularty those who are
most

1429
00:44:02.611 --> 00:44:04.903
respects, particularly those who are
most vulnerable. I will believe the

1430
00:44:04.903 --> 00:44:06.611

to be rebuilt in seats that, I
think, for a long time many Labour

think, for a long time many Labour
politicians took for granted and

thought they could count on for

1533
00:47:07.153 --> 00:47:08.361
do spend a lot of time... And some
of the candidates are from the

1534
00:47:08.361 --> 00:47:12.694
of the candidates are from the
north. Someone up there a scion,

1535
00:47:12.694 --> 00:47:13.819
north. Someone up there a scion,
thinking, when the trains are

1536
00:47:13.819 --> 00:47:16.944
thinking, when the trains are
mnning!

1537
00:47:16.944 --> 00:47:17.653
thinking, when the trains are
running! Forgive me, but

1538
00:47:17.653 --> 00:47:17.944
thinking, when the trains are
running! Forgive me, butl

1539
00:47:17.944 --> 00:47:18.444
thinking, when the trains are
running! Forgive me, but I really do

1540
00:47:18.444 --> 00:47:19.319
mnning! Forgive me, butl really do
think that. . .

1541
00:47:19.319 --> 00:47:19.944
running! Forgive me, but I really do
think that... And if Boris

1542
00:47:19.944 --> 00:47:20.111
running! Forgive me, but I really do
think that... And if BorisJohnson

1543
00:47:20.111 --> 00:47:20.778
think that... And if Boris johnson
is going to

1544
00:47:20.778 --> 00:47:21.986
think that... And if BorisJohnson
is going to steal some of our

1545
00:47:21.986 --> 00:47:25.528
is going to steal some of our
clothes and be a one—nation

1546
00:47:25.528 --> 00:47:26.278

Conservative, he could consider

1547
00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:26.944
Conservative, he could consider
renationalising the railways,

1548
00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:28.653
renationalising the railways,
actually, because I actually believe

1549
00:47:28.653 --> 00:47:34.653
actually, because I actually believe
that is a very popular policy.

1550
00:47:34.694 --> 00:47:40.861
that is a very popular policy. Let’s
just get a microphone to you. They

1551
00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:42.903
just get a microphone to you. They
need to realise that Labour suffered

1552
00:47:42.903 --> 00:47:43.361
need to realise that labour suffered
their

1553
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.069
need to realise that Labour suffered
their worst election result since

1554
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:47.278
their worst election result since
1935, and the arrogant and

1555
00:47:47.278 --> 00:47:48.278
1935, and the arrogant and
condescending attitude and no shift

1556
00:47:48.278 --> 00:47:50.861
condescending attitude and no shift
in ideas and manifestoes will cost

1557
00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:56.944
in ideas and manifestoes will cost
you elections for decades to come.

1558
00:47:59.194 --> 00:48:02.903
you elections for decades to come. I
am actually trying very hard not to

1559
00:48:02.903 --> 00:48:04.861
am actually trying very hard not to
be arrogant, I don’t feel arrogant

1560
00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:06.861
be arrogant, I don’t feel arrogant
about that defeat, I really don’t, I

1561
00:48:06.861 --> 00:48:12.069
about that defeat, I really don’t, I

goes on...
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.

1589
00:48:47.444 --> 00:48:51.986
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.
Forgive me. So, I think the

1590
00:48:51.986 --> 00:48:54.236
Forgive me. So, I think the
candidates will all be listening,

1591
00:48:54.236 --> 00:48:55.444
candidates will all be listening,
everybody was devastated by the

1592
00:48:55.444 --> 00:48:58.319
everybody was devastated by the
result, I don’t think it was because

1593
00:48:58.319 --> 00:48:59.903
result, I don’t think it was because
of railway nationalisation, I

1594
00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:01.694
of railway nationalisation, I
believe that that was a very popular

1595
00:49:01.694 --> 00:49:04.694
believe that that was a very popular
policy when I was knocking on doors.

1596
00:49:04.694 --> 00:49:06.694
policy when I was knocking on doors.
There are other issues. We were in a

1597
00:49:06.694 --> 00:49:09.361
There are other issues. We were in a
really difficult position on Brexit,

1598
00:49:09.361 --> 00:49:10.819
really difficult position on Brexit,
our members and voters were split on

1599
00:49:10.819 --> 00:49:15.236
our members and voters were split on
Brexit. I know that our position of

1600
00:49:15.236 --> 00:49:16.944
Brexit. I know that our position of
trying to bring these two sides

1601
00:49:16.944 --> 00:49:19.653
trying to bring these two sides
together did not work. And it was a

1602
00:49:19.653 --> 00:49:21.111
together did not work. And it was a
Brexit election. Of course it wasn’t

1603
00:49:21.111 --> 00:49:22.611
Brexit elaction. Of course it wasn’t
the only issue, I

1604
00:49:22.611 --> 00:49:23.153
Brexit election. Of course it wasn’t
the only issue, I do appreciate

1605
00:49:23.153 --> 00:49:26.403
the only issue, I do appreciate
that, but it was a very, very big

1606
00:49:26.403 --> 00:49:27.778
that, but it was a very, very big
issue in the Brexit election and all

1607
00:49:27.778 --> 00:49:30.069
issue in the Brexit election and all
the media were calling it the Brexit

1608
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:32.403
the media were calling it the Brexit
election and we didn’t manage to

1609
00:49:32.403 --> 00:49:34.361
election and we didn’t manage to
make it about other issues. But, of

1610
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:36.486
make it about other issues. But, of
course, we lost, and we lost very

1611
00:49:36.486 --> 00:49:39.319
course, we lost, and we lost very
badly, we have to listen, I believe

1612
00:49:39.319 --> 00:49:40.611
badly, we have to listen, I believe
all of the candidates will listen,

1613
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:44.236
all of the candidates will listen,
and it will be for them, one of

1614
00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:49.111
and it will be for them, one of
them, to lead us back to government.

1615
00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:53.694
them, to lead us back to government.

deserves a lot of credit. I am

1637

deserves a lot of credit. I am
neutral in the Labour Party

1638

neutral in the labour Party
leadership

1639
00:50:23.236 --> 00:50:24.486
neutral in the Labour Party
leadership contest, I think you

1640
00:50:24.486 --> 00:50:26.278
leadership contest, I think you
should ask a Scottish Labour Party

1641
00:50:26.278 --> 00:50:26.486
should ask a Scottish labour Party
politician,

1642
00:50:26.486 --> 00:50:27.486
should ask a Scottish Labour Party
politician, although to be far,

1643
00:50:27.486 --> 00:50:28.903
politician, although to be far,
there are not many of them around

1644
00:50:28.903 --> 00:50:30.236
there are not many of them around
any

1645
00:50:30.236 --> 00:50:32.403
there are not many of them around
any. The point about reconnecting

1646
00:50:32.403 --> 00:50:34.319
any. The point about reconnecting
with the voters is absolutely right.

1647
00:50:34.319 --> 00:50:36.028
with the voters is absolutely right.
The Labour Party in Scotland took

1648
00:50:36.028 --> 00:50:36.653
The labour Party in Scotland took
peopla for

1649
00:50:36.653 --> 00:50:37.861
The Labour Party in Scotland took
people for granted, and lost touch.

1650
00:50:37.861 --> 00:50:39.569
peopla for granted, and lost touch.
That is why my

1651
00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:40.653
people for granted, and lost touch.
That is why my party in the last

1652
00:50:40.653 --> 00:50:42.153
That is why my party in the last
election, where I was

1653
00:50:42.153 --> 00:50:42.361
That is why my party in the last
election, where I wasjust

1654
00:50:42.361 --> 00:50:42.569
That is why my party in the last
election, where I was just elected

1655
00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:42.903
election, where I was just eluted
into

1656
00:50:42.903 --> 00:50:43.861
election, where I was just elected
into Westminster, the Labour Party

1657
00:50:43.861 --> 00:50:44.944
into Westminster, the labour Party
only has one

1658
00:50:44.944 --> 00:50:45.986
into Westminster, the Labour Party
only has one seat in the whole of

1659
00:50:45.986 --> 00:50:48.278
only has one seat in the whole of
Scotland. That’s how quickly this

1660
00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:50.444
Scotland. That’s how quickly this
stuff can change. In northern

1661
00:50:50.444 --> 00:50:51.444
stuff ran change. In northern
England, I

1662
00:50:51.444 --> 00:50:51.986
stuff can change. In northern
England, I studied at Leeds

1663
00:50:51.986 --> 00:50:53.361
England, I studied at Leeds
University, I know the north of

1664
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:54.986
University, I know the north of
England pretty well, you are the

1665
00:50:54.986 --> 00:50:57.528
England pretty well, you are the
right end of England, after all, for

1666
00:50:57.528 --> 00:50:59.361
right end of England, after all, for
me. And Liverpool, I

1667
00:50:59.361 --> 00:50:59.986
right end of England, after all, for
me. And Liverpool, lam basically at

1668
00:50:59.986 --> 00:51:01.944
me. And Liverpool, lam basically at
home. But a lot of people voted Tory

1669
00:51:01.944 --> 00:51:02.153
home. But a lot of peopla voted Tory
not

1670
00:51:02.153 --> 00:51:04.361
home. But a lot of people voted Tory
not because they wanted to vote Tory

1671
00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:05.986
not because they wanted to vote Tory
and voted in spite of Boris

1672
00:51:05.986 --> 00:51:06.194
not because they wanted to vote Tory
and voted in spite of Borisjohnson,

1673
00:51:06.194 --> 00:51:06.778
and voted in spite of Boris johnson,
but they voted

1674
00:51:06.778 --> 00:51:07.611
and voted in spite of Borisjohnson,
but they voted out of sheer

1675
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:08.986
but they voted out of sheer
frustration with the shambles that

1676
00:51:08.986 --> 00:51:09.903
fmstration with the shambles that
the

1677
00:51:09.903 --> 00:51:11.194
frustration with the shambles that
the Labour Party has become under

1678
00:51:11.194 --> 00:51:11.944
the labour Party has become under
jeremy Corbyn.

1679
00:51:11.944 --> 00:51:13.069
the Labour Party has become under
Jeremy Corbyn. As a friend of

1680
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.569
jeremy Corbyn. As a friend of
England and

1681
00:51:13.569 --> 00:51:14.111
Jeremy Corbyn. As a friend of
England and a progressive

1682
00:51:14.111 --> 00:51:15.778
England and a progressive
politician, I really want to see the

1683
00:51:15.778 --> 00:51:16.986
politician, I really want to see the
labour Party

1684
00:51:16.986 --> 00:51:17.944

Labour candidate do you believe

1703
00:51:48.444 --> 00:51:56.444
should best represent the voters of
the North? Keir Starmer? Why? He

1704
00:51:56.444 --> 00:51:57.236
the North? Keir Starmer? why? He
just looks like

1705
00:51:57.236 --> 00:51:58.319
the North? Keir Starmer? Why? He
just looks like he can take Boris on

1706
00:51:58.319 --> 00:51:58.944
just looks like he ran take Boris on
quite well, do

1707
00:51:58.944 --> 00:52:01.278
just looks like he can take Boris on
quite well, do you know what I mean?

1708
00:52:01.278 --> 00:52:03.778
quite well, do you know what I mean?
You don’t think any of the four

1709
00:52:03.778 --> 00:52:06.736
You don’t think any of the four
women would be...? Oh, it’s not

1710
00:52:06.736 --> 00:52:08.069
women would be...? Oh, it’s not
about women, jeepers, creepers. I am

1711
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.694
about women, jeepers, creepers. lam
just interested in

1712
00:52:08.694 --> 00:52:13.861
about women, jeepers, creepers. I am
just interested in your view. Any

1713
00:52:13.861 --> 00:52:16.236
just interested in your view. Any
woman... Because it’s really

1714
00:52:16.236 --> 00:52:18.028
woman... Because it’s really
important what gender you are or sex

1715
00:52:18.028 --> 00:52:19.653
important what gender you are or sex
you are rather than what your

1716
00:52:19.653 --> 00:52:21.111
you are rather than what your
policies are and how you approach

1717
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:23.236
policies are and how you approach
politic. I

1718
00:52:23.236 --> 00:52:24.278
policies are and how you approach
politics. I think what Shami said is

1719
00:52:24.278 --> 00:52:24.903
politic. I think what Shami said is
also part of

1720
00:52:24.903 --> 00:52:25.694
politics. I think what Shami said is
also part of the problem which is

1721
00:52:25.694 --> 00:52:27.778
also part of the problem which is
going on in the Labour Party, so

1722
00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:28.361
going on in the labour Party, so
many of the

1723
00:52:28.361 --> 00:52:29.069
going on in the Labour Party, so
many of the candidates have made

1724
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:30.694
many of the candidates have made
reference to their identity, people

1725
00:52:30.694 --> 00:52:32.236
reference to their identity, people
are fed up with identity politics

1726
00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:32.694
are fed up with identity politic
but they

1727
00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:33.986
are fed up with identity politics
but they keep talking about how

1728
00:52:33.986 --> 00:52:34.194
but they keep talking about how
cmmmy

1729
00:52:34.194 --> 00:52:36.486
but they keep talking about how
crummy their school was, what their

1730
00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:37.111
cmmmy their school was, what their
gender is, at

1731
00:52:37.111 --> 00:52:38.694
crummy their school was, what their
gender is, et cetera, and even at

1732
00:52:38.694 --> 00:52:39.736
gender is, et cetera, and even at
the last general election, Jo

1733
00:52:39.736 --> 00:52:40.611
the last general election, Jo
Swinson made her gender

1734
00:52:40.611 --> 00:52:41.486
the last general election, Jo
Swinson made her genderfront and

1735
00:52:41.486 --> 00:52:41.944
Swinson made her gender front and
centre of

1736
00:52:41.944 --> 00:52:42.986
Swinson made her genderfront and
centre of the Lib Dems campaign and

1737
00:52:42.986 --> 00:52:44.986
centre of the Lib Dems campaign and
she even implied that the reason she

1738
00:52:44.986 --> 00:52:46.319
she even implied that the reason she
was being restricted from the

1739
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:48.278
was being restricted from the
leadership debates wasn’t that it

1740
00:52:48.278 --> 00:52:49.319
leadership debates wasn’t that it
was in the obvious political

1741
00:52:49.319 --> 00:52:51.028
was in the obvious political
interest of her opponents, but

1742
00:52:51.028 --> 00:52:52.986
interest of her opponents, but
because they were obviously sexist.

1743
00:52:52.986 --> 00:52:53.278
because they were obviously sexist.
The

1744
00:52:53.278 --> 00:52:54.111
berause they were obviously sexist.
The public

1745
00:52:54.111 --> 00:52:55.486
because they were obviously sexist.
The public disagreed with that view.

1746
00:52:55.486 --> 00:52:58.319
The public disagreed with that view.
I think if they keep zoning in words

1747
00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:59.694
I think if they keep zoning in words
on identity characteristics, what

1748
00:52:59.694 --> 00:52:59.944
on identity characteristic, what
happened

1749
00:52:59.944 --> 00:53:00.403
on identity characteristics, what
happened with Jeremy

1750
00:53:00.403 --> 00:53:01.528
on identity characteristics, what
happened withJeremy Corbyn, if you

1751
00:53:01.528 --> 00:53:01.944
happened with jeremy Corbyn, if you
look at

1752
00:53:01.944 --> 00:53:02.778
happened withJeremy Corbyn, if you
look at the polling, the public

1753
00:53:02.778 --> 00:53:04.111
look at the polling, the public
actually agrees with many key

1754
00:53:04.111 --> 00:53:05.611
actually agrees with many key
plaques of his policy platform but

1755
00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:07.028
plaques of his policy platform but
they didn’t vote for him because

1756
00:53:07.028 --> 00:53:08.986
they didn’t vote for him because
they did not think he was competent.

1757
00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:11.944
they did not think he was competent.
I think they want a competent

1758
00:53:11.944 --> 00:53:14.361
I think they want a competent
leader, it is that simple. Which

1759
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:14.444
leader, it is that simple. which
labour

1760
00:53:14.444 --> 00:53:15.528
leader, it is that simple. Which
Labour leader would you least like

1761
00:53:15.528 --> 00:53:16.528
labour leader would you least like
to see? I

1762
00:53:16.528 --> 00:53:17.986
Labour leader would you least like
to see? I mean, it is up to Labour

1763
00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:18.486
to see? I mean, it is up to labour
to choose

1764
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:19.819
to see? I mean, it is up to Labour
to choose their own leader and I do

1765
00:53:19.819 --> 00:53:22.528
to choose their own leader and I do
not want to say anything that would

1766
00:53:22.528 --> 00:53:23.278
not want to say anything that would
inﬂuence,

1767
00:53:23.278 --> 00:53:24.194
not want to say anything that would
influence, saying who I think is

1768
00:53:24.194 --> 00:53:24.653
inﬂuence, saying who I think is
best or

1769
00:53:24.653 --> 00:53:27.569
influence, saying who I think is
best or worst. I guess my overall

1770
00:53:27.569 --> 00:53:30.236
best or worst. I guess my overall
view on what I would hope the future

1771
00:53:30.236 --> 00:53:30.528
view on what I would hope the future
labour

1772
00:53:30.528 --> 00:53:31.653
view on what I would hope the future
Labour leader should do, and I think

1773
00:53:31.653 --> 00:53:32.486
labour leader should do, and I think
it is really

1774
00:53:32.486 --> 00:53:33.403
Labour leader should do, and I think
it is really important that we have

1775
00:53:33.403 --> 00:53:36.153
it is really important that we have
a really strong opposition in the

1776
00:53:36.153 --> 00:53:38.153
a really strong opposition in the
country, is, firstly, listen to

Brexit, get that. Lots of people

we have got very little time left

1790
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:08.653
we have got very little time left
but I want to get one question in

1791
00:54:08.653 --> 00:54:09.194
but I want to get one question in
that a fair

1792
00:54:09.194 --> 00:54:09.486
but I want to get one question in
that a fairfew

1793
00:54:09.486 --> 00:54:10.236
but I want to get one question in
that a fair few people wanted to ask

1794
00:54:10.236 --> 00:54:15.194
that a fair few peopla wanted to ask
about. Is

1795
00:54:15.194 --> 00:54:16.528
that a fair few people wanted to ask
about. Is it coincidental that after

1796
00:54:16.528 --> 00:54:21.819
about. Is it coincidental that after
the worst figures of recent years

1797
00:54:21.819 --> 00:54:24.819
the worst figures of recent years
regarding the four hour A&E waiting

1798
00:54:24.819 --> 00:54:25.236
regarding the four hour AaE waiting
targets has

1799
00:54:25.236 --> 00:54:26.319
regarding the four hour A&E waiting
targets has been published this week

1800
00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:27.944
targets has been published this week
at the same time as the government

1801
00:54:27.944 --> 00:54:28.903
at the same time as the government
is talking about scrapping the

1802
00:54:28.903 --> 00:54:33.069
is talking about scrapping the
target? These are A&E waiting

1803
00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.819
target? These are AaE waiting
targets in

1804
00:54:33.819 --> 00:54:34.528
target? These are A&E waiting
targets in England, the worst

1805
00:54:34.528 --> 00:54:35.944
targets in England, the worst
figures on record. We haven’t got

1806
00:54:35.944 --> 00:54:37.236
figures on record. We haven’t got
much time but I think it is

1807
00:54:37.236 --> 00:54:40.319
much time but I think it is
important. The government is hinting

1808
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:41.986
important. The government is hinting
at scrapping the four hour target.

1809
00:54:41.986 --> 00:54:42.194
at scrapping the four hour target.
What

1810
00:54:42.194 --> 00:54:42.653
at scrapping the four hour target.
what is going

1811
00:54:42.653 --> 00:54:44.861
at scrapping the four hour target.
What is going to happen? I know it

1812
00:54:44.861 --> 00:54:45.319
what is going to happen? I know it
has been

1813
00:54:45.319 --> 00:54:46.861
What is going to happen? I know it
has been really tough in A&E in

1814
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:47.236
has been really tough in “IE in
winter in

1815
00:54:47.236 --> 00:54:50.236
has been really tough in A&E in
winter in the NHS, tough for staff

1816
00:54:50.236 --> 00:54:52.569
winter in the NHS, tough for staff
in the NHS, and as always, thank you

1817
00:54:52.569 --> 00:54:53.861
in the NHS, and as always, thank you
to all the NHS staff who are

1818
00:54:53.861 --> 00:54:55.028
to all the NHS staff who are
sticking with it and working so

1819
00:54:55.028 --> 00:55:00.111
sticking with it and working so
hard. I think that the review of the

1820
00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:01.236
hard. I think that the review of the
waiting time target wasn’t suggested

1821
00:55:01.236 --> 00:55:03.028
waiting time target wasn’t suggested
quite a while ago and I think it has

1822
00:55:03.028 --> 00:55:05.278
quite a while ago and I think it has
been around, it is not suddenly now.

1823
00:55:05.278 --> 00:55:07.903
been around, it is not suddenly now.
I think there is a view overall on

1824
00:55:07.903 --> 00:55:09.736
I think there is a view overall on
targets, and I have it from having

1825
00:55:09.736 --> 00:55:11.528
targets, and I have it from having
worked in quite a few hospitals

1826
00:55:11.528 --> 00:55:15.611
worked in quite a few hospitals
before I was an MP, that a box

1827
00:55:15.611 --> 00:55:17.611
before I was an MP, that a box
ticking target culture isn’t

1828
00:55:17.611 --> 00:55:19.528
ticking target culture isn’t
helpful. Accountability and

1829
00:55:19.528 --> 00:55:20.944
helpful. Accountability and
transparency is important. 50, it is

1830
00:55:20.944 --> 00:55:21.569
transparency is important. So, it is
important to be

1831
00:55:21.569 --> 00:55:22.153
transparency is important. 50, it is
important to be measuring stuff and

1832
00:55:22.153 --> 00:55:24.194
important to be measuring stuff and
reporting on it and measuring it in

1833
00:55:24.194 --> 00:55:26.403
reporting on it and measuring it in
the right way, but to do it in a way

1834
00:55:26.403 --> 00:55:29.111
the right way, but to do it in a way
that is best for patients, is the

1835
00:55:29.111 --> 00:55:29.319
that is best for patients, is the
“Y

1836
00:55:29.319 --> 00:55:31.236
that is best for patients, is the
way forward, not to do what seems to

1837
00:55:31.236 --> 00:55:32.653
way forward, not to do what seems to
get the best headlines, but to do

1838
00:55:32.653 --> 00:55:35.319
get the best headlines, but to do
what is best for patients. Not

1839
00:55:35.319 --> 00:55:36.486
what is best for patients. Not
because it is embarrassing for the

1840
00:55:36.486 --> 00:55:39.444
because it is embarrassing for the
government after ten years? No, it

1841
00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:42.444
government after ten years? No, it
is not a sudden thing to be looking

1842
00:55:42.444 --> 00:55:44.028
is not a sudden thing to be looking
at the A&E target. I absolutely

1843
00:55:44.028 --> 00:55:44.236
at the “IE target. I absolutely
recognise

1844
00:55:44.236 --> 00:55:46.236
at the A&E target. I absolutely
recognise the pressures on the NHS,

1845
00:55:46.236 --> 00:55:47.819
recognise the pressures on the NHS,
the important thing is that it is

1846
00:55:47.819 --> 00:55:49.319
the important thing is that it is
getting a really huge,

1847
00:55:49.319 --> 00:55:53.361
getting a really huge,
record—breaking, increase in

1848
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:54.403
record—breaking, increase in
investment, £34 billion per year

1849
00:55:54.403 --> 00:55:54.653
investment, 54 billion per year
extra

1850
00:55:54.653 --> 00:55:54.903
investment, £34 billion per year
extra will

1851
00:55:54.903 --> 00:55:55.028
investment, 54 billion per year
extra will go

1852
00:55:55.028 --> 00:55:57.403
investment, £34 billion per year
extra will go into it. We’re going

1853
00:55:57.403 --> 00:55:59.194
extra will go into it. We’re going
to have more nurses, more doctors,

1854
00:55:59.194 --> 00:56:00.903
to have more nurses, more doctors,
new hospitals, we are going to

1855
00:56:00.903 --> 00:56:02.444
new hospitals, we are going to
really invest in it and make use of

1856
00:56:02.444 --> 00:56:08.694
really invest in it and make use of
having a strong economy to do that.

1857
00:56:08.694 --> 00:56:10.319
having a strong economy to do that.
The question is about English A&E

1858
00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:10.694
The question is about English “IE
figures, I

1859
00:56:10.694 --> 00:56:12.444
The question is about English A&E
figures, I would say that we are in

1860
00:56:12.444 --> 00:56:15.903
figures, I would say that we are in
charge of the NHS in Scotland and

1861
00:56:15.903 --> 00:56:16.986
charge of the NHS in Scotland and
Scotland’s A&E has outperformed all

1862
00:56:16.986 --> 00:56:19.403
Scotland’s A&E has outperformed all
countries of the UK in the last four

1863
00:56:19.403 --> 00:56:21.486
countries of the UK in the last four
years. The last time they hit the

1864
00:56:21.486 --> 00:56:22.528
years. The last time they hit the
95%

1865
00:56:22.528 --> 00:56:23.111
years. The last time they hit the
9596 target

1866
00:56:23.111 --> 00:56:24.819
years. The last time they hit the
95% target was in 2017. We have

1867
00:56:24.819 --> 00:56:25.944
95% target was in 2017. We have
outperformed the other countries.

1868
00:56:25.944 --> 00:56:27.986
outperformed the other countries.
So, not brilliantly but perhaps not

1869
00:56:27.986 --> 00:56:30.486
So, not brilliantly but perhaps not
quite as badly? There are lots of

1870
00:56:30.486 --> 00:56:32.403
quite as badly? There are lots of
things we need to do better,

1871
00:56:32.403 --> 00:56:33.903
things we need to do better,
absolutely. But the point I would be

1872
00:56:33.903 --> 00:56:35.694
absolutely. But the point I would be
making is that I don’t trust the

1873
00:56:35.694 --> 00:56:41.194
making is that I don’t trust the
Tories on the NHS.

1874
00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:44.403
Tories on the NHS. Shami, do you
think the four hour target should be

1875
00:56:44.403 --> 00:56:46.861
think the four hour target should be
scrapped? Of course not, and for the

1876
00:56:46.861 --> 00:56:49.319
scrapped? Of course not, and for the
reason that Helen gave, you want

1877
00:56:49.319 --> 00:56:50.194
reason that Helen gave, you want
accountability and transparency, you

1878
00:56:50.194 --> 00:56:52.444
accountability and transparency, you
don’t say we didn’t meet the target,

1879
00:56:52.444 --> 00:56:54.944
don’t say we didn’t meet the target,
we abolish the target country I was

1880
00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.444
we abolish the target country I was
told, quite rightly, don’t talk

1881
00:56:56.444 --> 00:56:58.569
told, quite rightly, don’t talk
Britain down. One of the best things

1882
00:56:58.569 --> 00:57:00.486
Britain down. One of the best things
about Britain, envied all over the

1883
00:57:00.486 --> 00:57:03.069
about Britain, envied all over the
world, has been the NHS. One of the

1884
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:05.694
world, has been the NHS. One of the
best thing is that Labour ever did

1885
00:57:05.694 --> 00:57:06.028
best thing is that labour ever did
in its

1886
00:57:06.028 --> 00:57:07.569
best thing is that Labour ever did
in its 100—odd years. And I think

1887
00:57:07.569 --> 00:57:08.444
in its 100-odd years. And I think
that four

1888
00:57:08.444 --> 00:57:10.319
in its 100—odd years. And I think
that four ours is a very long time

1889
00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:11.986
that four ours is a very long time
to be a sick person. Sometimes

1890
00:57:11.986 --> 00:57:15.278
to be a sick person. Sometimes
people have been queueing outside

1891
00:57:15.278 --> 00:57:15.611
people have been queueing outside
A&Fs in

1892
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:17.986
people have been queueing outside
A&Es in the cold, in the winter,

1893
00:57:17.986 --> 00:57:18.403
Aan in the cold, in the winter,
that is

1894
00:57:18.403 --> 00:57:19.028
A&Es in the cold, in the winter,
that is completely unacceptable in

1895
00:57:19.028 --> 00:57:20.278
that is completely unacceptable in
one of the wealthiest countries on

1896
00:57:20.278 --> 00:57:24.028
one of the wealthiest countries on
earth. And Helen, I urge you,

1897
00:57:24.028 --> 00:57:26.278
earth. And Helen, I urge you,
please, don’t scrap the targets,

1898
00:57:26.278 --> 00:57:27.486
please, don’t scrap the targets,
don’t scrap the transparency and

1899
00:57:27.486 --> 00:57:28.403
don’t scrap the transparency and
accountability and let’s get behind

1900
00:57:28.403 --> 00:57:34.069
accountability and let’s get behind
the NHS. I didn’t suggest for a

1901
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.986
the NHS. I didn’t suggest for a
moment that we should scrap

1902
00:57:34.986 --> 00:57:38.153
moment that we should scrap
transparency and accountability.

1903
00:57:38.153 --> 00:57:40.819
transparency and accountability.
Under a Conservative government, we

1904
00:57:40.819 --> 00:57:42.486
Under a Conservative government, we
have made huge strides, absolutely

1905
00:57:42.486 --> 00:57:43.403
have made huge strides, absolutely
committed to transparency and

1906
00:57:43.403 --> 00:57:45.069
committed to transparency and
accountability, but let’s do it in a

1907
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.611
accountability, but let’s do it in a
“Y

1908
00:57:45.611 --> 00:57:47.819
accountability, but let’s do it in a
way that results in the best care

1909
00:57:47.819 --> 00:57:48.361
way that results in the best rare
for patients.

1910
00:57:48.361 --> 00:57:49.403
way that results in the best care
for patients. But today, all the

1911
00:57:49.403 --> 00:57:50.694
for patients. But today, all the
practitioners have been crying out

1912
00:57:50.694 --> 00:57:52.028
practitioners have been crying out
and saying otherwise, they have been

1913
00:57:52.028 --> 00:57:54.153
and saying otherwise, they have been
saying how terrible it would be to

1914
00:57:54.153 --> 00:57:59.444
saying how terrible it would be to
scrap these targets.

1915
00:58:02.486 --> 00:58:02.986
scrap these targets. Labour have

1916
00:58:02.986 --> 00:58:03.444
scrap these targets. labour have
planned to

1917
00:58:03.444 --> 00:58:04.986
scrap these targets. Labour have
planned to scrap Ofsted and other

1918
00:58:04.986 --> 00:58:06.278
planned to scrap Ofsted and other
forms of target gathering in

1919
00:58:06.278 --> 00:58:06.611
forms of target gathering in
education, so

1920
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:07.028
forms of target gathering in
education, sol

1921
00:58:07.028 --> 00:58:07.986
forms of target gathering in
education, so I think it goes both

1922
00:58:07.986 --> 00:58:10.611
education, so I think it goes both
ways. But we heard about a winter

1923
00:58:10.611 --> 00:58:12.069
ways. But we heard about a winter
crisis, travelling abroad, it is so

1924
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:14.986
crisis, travelling abroad, it is so
rare to hear other countries in a

1925
00:58:14.986 --> 00:58:16.028
rare to hear other countries in a
perpetual winter crisis. This has

1926
00:58:16.028 --> 00:58:17.194
perpetual winter crisis. This has
been happening to the NHS for

1927
00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:20.444
been happening to the NHS for
decades. I think we can and should

1928
00:58:20.444 --> 00:58:20.819
decades. I think we ran and should
spend much

1929
00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:22.028
decades. I think we can and should
spend much more on the NHS and I

1930
00:58:22.028 --> 00:58:24.194
spend much more on the NHS and I
think funding is part of the

1931
00:58:24.194 --> 00:58:25.986
think funding is part of the
solution. But I also think that

1932
00:58:25.986 --> 00:58:28.028
solution. But I also think that
given we are wedded to a highly

1933
00:58:28.028 --> 00:58:29.153
given we are wedded to a highly
centralised, top—down model which

1934
00:58:29.153 --> 00:58:29.778
centralised, top-down model which
has been

1935
00:58:29.778 --> 00:58:30.819
centralised, top—down model which
has been in place since

1936
00:58:30.819 --> 00:58:31.236
centralised, top—down model which
has been in place since1948, we

1937
00:58:31.236 --> 00:58:31.444
has been in place since 1948, we
should

1938
00:58:31.444 --> 00:58:34.028
has been in place since1948, we
should also take a look at best

1939
00:58:34.028 --> 00:58:35.153
should also take a look at best
practice abroad. The dysfunctional

1940
00:58:35.153 --> 00:58:38.403
practice abroad. The dysfunctional
American system isn’t... It is not

1941
00:58:38.403 --> 00:58:40.444
American system isn’t... It is not
the only game in town, we should

1942
00:58:40.444 --> 00:58:42.694
the only game in town, we should
look at what works in Europe, where

1943
00:58:42.694 --> 00:58:44.153
look at what works in Europe, where
they manage things very differently

1944
00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:46.069
they manage things very differently
and they certainly are not living in

1945
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:50.694
and they certainly are not living in
perpetual winter crisis mode.

1946
00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:53.819
perpetual winter crisis mode.
Laurence? As somebody very close to

1947
00:58:53.819 --> 00:59:00.111
Laurence? As somebody very close to
me has just been

Laurence? As somebody very close to
me hasjust been in A&E, on the E

1949
00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:02.986
me has just been in “IE, on the E
end of it, and

1950
00:59:02.986 --> 00:59:03.903
me hasjust been in A&E, on the E
end of it, and they were treated

1951
00:59:03.903 --> 00:59:04.611
end of it, and they were treated
straightaway, and absolutely

1952
00:59:04.611 --> 00:59:05.153
straightaway, and absolutely
wonderfully, so

1953
00:59:05.153 --> 00:59:05.403
straightaway, and absolutely
wonderfully, sol

1954
00:59:05.403 --> 00:59:05.986
straightaway, and absolutely
wonderfully, so I am very grateful

1955
00:59:05.986 --> 00:59:09.611
wonderfully, so I am very grateful
for the NHS. Well, an accident can

1956
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:10.528
for the NHS. Well, an accident ran
be an

1957
00:59:10.528 --> 00:59:13.319
for the NHS. Well, an accident can
be an emergency lamp or it can be, I

1958
00:59:13.319 --> 00:59:13.861
be an emergency lamp or it ran be, I
don’t know. Keep

1959
00:59:13.861 --> 00:59:14.528
be an emergency lamp or it can be, I
don’t know. Keep targets, why not.

1960
00:59:14.528 --> 00:59:19.236
don’t know. Keep targets, why not.
But I think the NHS when you really

1961
00:59:19.236 --> 00:59:23.653
But I think the NHS when you really
need them is incredible. I

1962
00:59:23.653 --> 00:59:23.778
But I think the NHS when you really
need them is incredible. Ijust

1963
00:59:23.778 --> 00:59:26.444
need them is incredible. Ijust
wanted a quick follow—up to say that

1964
00:59:26.444 --> 00:59:26.903
wanted a quick follow-up to say that
you haven’t

1965
00:59:26.903 --> 00:59:27.736
wanted a quick follow—up to say that
you haven’t mentioned social care,

1966
00:59:27.736 --> 00:59:28.069
you haven’t mentioned social rare,
and the

1967
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:30.236
you haven’t mentioned social care,
and the situation in A&E will never

1968
00:59:30.236 --> 00:59:30.778
and the situation in “IE will never
get better

1969
00:59:30.778 --> 00:59:32.236
and the situation in A&E will never
get better until you sort out social

1970
00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:33.819
get better until you sort out social
rare. And

1971
00:59:33.819 --> 00:59:35.028
get better until you sort out social
care. And there is no indication to

1972
00:59:35.028 --> 00:59:35.194
rare. And there is no indication to
rasuals

1973
00:59:35.194 --> 00:59:37.278
care. And there is no indication to
casuals that you have any plan, it

1974
00:59:37.278 --> 00:59:38.069
rasuals that you have any plan, it
is just a wish.

1975
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:39.028
casuals that you have any plan, it
is just a wish. But you have got to

1976
00:59:39.028 --> 00:59:45.653
is just a wish. But you have got to
do that. When are we going to see

1977
00:59:45.653 --> 00:59:45.986
do that. when are we going to see
something on

1978
00:59:45.986 --> 00:59:46.861
do that. When are we going to see
something on social care, Boris

1979
00:59:46.861 --> 00:59:47.278
something on social rare, Boris
johnson said

1980
00:59:47.278 --> 00:59:48.569
something on social care, Boris
Johnson said this year? He did

1981
00:59:48.569 --> 00:59:49.236
johnson said this year? He did
indeed say

1982
00:59:49.236 --> 00:59:50.153
Johnson said this year? He did
indeed say this year and you are

1983
00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.486
indeed say this year and you are
absolutely right because when you’ve

1984
00:59:51.486 --> 00:59:53.486
absolutely right because when you’ve
got people in hospital who are

1985
00:59:53.486 --> 00:59:54.486
got peopla in hospital who are
actually

1986
00:59:54.486 --> 00:59:55.361
got people in hospital who are
actually better being somewhere

1987
00:59:55.361 --> 00:59:56.986
actually better being somewhere

people who

00:59:57.403 --> 00:59:58.361
else, so that hospitals can treat
people who need to be in hospital,

1990
00:59:58.361 --> 00:59:58.611
peopla who need to be in hospital,
that

1991
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:00.236
people who need to be in hospital,
that would be much better

1992
01:00:00.236 --> 01:00:00.569
people who need to be in hospital,
that would be much betterfor the

1993
01:00:00.569 --> 01:00:00.986
that would be much better for the
NHS and

1994
01:00:00.986 --> 01:00:01.486
that would be much betterfor the
NHS and much better

1995
01:00:01.486 --> 01:00:04.861
that would be much betterfor the
NHS and much betterfor the patient.

1996
01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:05.153
NHS and much better for the patient.
Its words,

1997
01:00:05.153 --> 01:00:07.819
NHS and much betterfor the patient.
Its words, though, isn’t it? Well, I

1998
01:00:07.819 --> 01:00:09.736
Its words, though, isn’t it? Well, I
mean, the point is that we need

1999
01:00:09.736 --> 01:00:12.403
mean, the point is that we need
to... We had a consensus in the

2000
01:00:12.403 --> 01:00:12.694
to... We had a consensus in the
19405

2001
01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:14.694
to... We had a consensus in the
1940s about a national commitment to

2002
01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.736
19405 about a national commitment to
the NHS. We need to have that kind

2003
01:00:16.736 --> 01:00:17.986
the NHS. We need to have that kind
of consensus around a commitment on

2004
01:00:17.986 --> 01:00:20.986
of consensus around a commitment on
social rare.

2005
01:00:20.986 --> 01:00:22.236
of consensus around a commitment on
social care. And social care must be

2006
01:00:22.236 --> 01:00:22.444
social rare. And social rare must be
properly

2007
01:00:22.444 --> 01:00:22.611
social rare. And social rare must be
property funded

2008
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:24.486
social care. And social care must be
properly funded and recognised, that

2009
01:00:24.486 --> 01:00:24.861
property funded and recognised, that
raring for

2010
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:25.653
properly funded and recognised, that
caring for people is really, really

2011
01:00:25.653 --> 01:00:28.528
raring for peopla is really, really
important.

2012
01:00:28.528 --> 01:00:29.028
caring for people is really, really
important. 0K, we

2013
01:00:29.028 --> 01:00:30.069
caring for people is really, really
important. 0K, we could keep going,

Of course it’s me.

2039

Stand and finish your story.

2040
01:01:45.444 --> 01:01:46.694
# Lust for life...

2041
01:01:46.694 --> 01:01:50.736
I will tear your world to pieces
and I will drink my fill.

2042
01:01:50.736 --> 01:01:51.944
# Lust for life...

2043
01:01:51.944 --> 01:01:53.653
He is a monster.

2044
01:01:53.653 --> 01:01:55.361
He is the Devil himself.

2045
01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:56.486
# Got a lust for life... #

2046
01:01:56.486 --> 01:01:58.986
I’m very careful with what I eat.

2047
01:01:58.986 --> 01:02:00.319
Me too.

2048
01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.653
All you have to do...

2049
01:02:02.653 --> 01:02:04.569
..is let me in.

2050
01:02:10.819 --> 01:02:13.903
WHISPERED CHANTING

2051
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:18.486
You’ve been warned before.

2052
01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:20.528
Grandma’s knickers.

2053
01:02:21.528 --> 01:02:22.569
WHISTLE BLOWS

2054
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:26.361
Unfortunately, she was
a ﬂexitarian vegan cannibal.

2055
01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:29.069
All bets are off.

2056
01:02:57.111 --> 01:02:59.903
Brexitcast from the BBC.

2057
01:02:59.903 --> 01:03:02.028
No one’s got a BLEEP
clue what Brexit is.

2058
01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.069
Brexit is, er...

2059
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:05.403
I hadn’t quite understood
the full extent of this.

2060
01:03:05.403 --> 01:03:09.153
We are particularly reliant
on the Dover—Calais crossing.

2061
01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:12.361
This election blew away the argument
for a second referendum.

2062
01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:15.028
I urge everyone to find closure.

2063
01:03:15.028 --> 01:03:17.778
Let the healing begin.

2064
01:03:17.778 --> 01:03:19.694
I’m sorry, we will miss you.

2065
01:03:19.694 --> 01:03:24.736
A process which I can only
describe as a dog’s Brexit.

2066
01:03:28.403 --> 01:03:29.611
This is Katya in Brussels.

2067
01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:31.528
And Adam in Brussels.

2068
01:03:31.528 --> 01:03:32.694
I’m Laura in Westminster.

2069
01:03:32.694 --> 01:03:34.944
And Chris in Westminster.

2070
01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:38.278
I think it’s fair to say, picking up
on where we were last week,

2071
01:03:38.278 --> 01:03:40.736
compared to where it was,
the news has lost some

2072
01:03:40.736 --> 01:03:44.236
of its capacity to excite,
but there is still stuff we can get

2073
01:03:44.236 --> 01:03:48.194
into, if we return to our Brexitcast
tradition of delighting

2074
01:03:48.194 --> 01:03:50.736
in the nuance and detail.

2075
01:03:50.736 --> 01:03:53.403
Sure, stuff has been happening,
and huge news in other parts

2076
01:03:53.403 --> 01:03:58.111
of the news landscape,
but from your end, guys,

2077
01:03:58.111 --> 01:04:01.028
although he said it in London,
I think, there was something quite

2078
01:04:01.028 --> 01:04:03.903
familiar but important from one
of the people who will really matter

2079
01:04:03.903 --> 01:04:05.111
in the next 12 months.

2080
01:04:05.111 --> 01:04:07.028
This is Phil Hogan.

2081
01:04:07.028 --> 01:04:08.653
Known as big Phil.

2082
01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:09.778
Is he?!

2083
01:04:09.778 --> 01:04:14.111
He is super tell, about six
foot six, very tall.

2084
01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:17.278
He has other attributes,
he is Irish, he was the Agriculture

2085
01:04:17.278 --> 01:04:19.944
Commissioner in the last commission
and now he is the Trade

2086
01:04:19.944 --> 01:04:20.986
Commissioner.

2087
01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:23.569
He is a big character,
pretty forceful.

2088
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:26.694
Yes, and he’s now Trade Commissioner
so will be involved in the trade

2089
01:04:26.694 --> 01:04:29.694
negotiations with the UK,
I think, but not exactly clear.

2090
01:04:29.694 --> 01:04:34.653
He was in America doing an interview
with Peter Mandelson

2091
01:04:35.444 --> 01:04:40.069
at a conference in London over,
like, a Facetime,

2092
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:43.153
Skypey kind of thing.

2093
01:04:43.153 --> 01:04:46.028
He was in the States to try
and smooth over trade tensions

2094
01:04:46.028 --> 01:04:51.028
between the US and EU,
but yes, he took part in this live

2095
01:04:51.736 --> 01:04:55.819
debate and took questions,
including some questions on Brexit.

2096
01:04:55.819 --> 01:04:58.653
What did we find out,
not that we’ve heard any of this

2097
01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:00.861
in the last few weeks,
about the likelihood

2098
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:05.111
of a comprehensive trade deal
in place and ratified by the end

2099
01:05:05.111 --> 01:05:07.069
of the year?

2100
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.194
Let’s listen.

2101
01:05:08.194 --> 01:05:13.111
Prime MinisterJohnson I think
unwisely decided he wants a deadline

2102
01:05:13.319 --> 01:05:16.736
again, he wants a timeline,
putting enormous pressure on the UK
