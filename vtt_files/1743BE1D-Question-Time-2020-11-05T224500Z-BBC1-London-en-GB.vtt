of the day. Temperatures are lifting
a bit across southern areas. Further

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:06.347
a bit across southern areas. Further
north, where fog is slow to lift its

north, where fog is slow to lift its
going to be quite a cold day. The

4
00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:10.972
going to be quite a cold day. The
second half of the weekend we have

5
00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:11.763
second half of the weekend we have
weak weather fronts moving

6
00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:12.597
weak weather fronts moving
northwards, so pretty cloudy out

7
00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:14.430
northwards, so pretty cloudy out
there. There will be patchy rain,

8
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.013
there. There will be patchy rain,
most of it running through the Irish

9
00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:17.180
most of it mnning through the Irish
Sea,

10
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.597
most of it running through the Irish
Sea, northwards into Northern

11
00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:19.638
Sea, northwards into Northern
Ireland, and eventually into the

12
00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:21.347
Ireland, and eventually into the
South West of Scotland. The

13
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.930
A demonstration took place
against the police...

14
00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:51.847
..which degenerated into totally
inexcusable violence.

15
00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:56.513
This is a sustained campaign...

16
00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:57.888
Hands off!

17
00:00:57.888 --> 00:00:59.430
..against black people...

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.305
Hands off! Hands off!

19
00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.847
..and today we will say
enough is enough!

20
00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:06.180
Hands off!

21
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.972

And thank you very much

48

very well as I went to schooljust

50
00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:02.680
round the corner.

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.430
Very good to see you.

52
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.347
And welcome, of course,

53
00:03:07.347 --> 00:03:09.972
Thank you very much for watching,
and dojoin in the

54
00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:12.597
conversation the usual way, at BBC
Question Time on social media.

55
00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:14.305
Right, let’s get our first question,
which is from Tom Adams.

56
00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:19.513
Good evening, panel.

57
00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.347
Whether Trump wins or loses
the Presidential election,

58
00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:25.305
he has gained many more votes
overall than 2016.

59
00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.722
Does this show that his message
resonates more than ever

60
00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:29.763
with the American people?

61
00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:32.305
Lisa?

62
00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:33.930
Igu
es '
slmup?

63
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.930
Ah, I was going to...

64
00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:45.263
Well, you will be up in a minute,
Jan, or you can kick

65
00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:46.472
us off, if you like.

66
00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:48.638
You’re chomping at the bit,
let’s hear from you.

67
00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:49.680
Well, yes.

68
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.263
The thing is that the pollsters said
that there was going to be a blue

69
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.180
wave and we were going
to lose seats.

70
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.847
Instead, the support
for Trump has gone...

71
00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:04.597
We call it going down ballot,
and it has had a wide impact.

72
00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:09.347
Right, yes, he’s certainly...

73
00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:12.263
Lisa, it’s a fair point that Jan
makes, that the polls

74
00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:15.972
were showing that Biden
was going to win reasonably easily.

75
00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:17.638
That’s not happening at the moment.

76
00:04:17.638 --> 00:04:20.013
We still don’t know who’s
going to win, of course,

77
00:04:20.013 --> 00:04:22.430
but Trump has increased,
more people have voted for Trump

78
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.055
this time than they did last time.

79
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.180
Yeah.

80
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.013
I think what this has shown
is that America is a very

81
00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:29.055
deeply divided country.

82
00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:31.222
The 2016 election revealed huge
divisions in American society

83
00:04:31.222 --> 00:04:36.222
and my impression from the turnout
figures, Joe Biden is on course

84
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.680
to win more votes than any
presidential candidate in history,

85
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.680
but Donald Trump has also increased
the number of votes that he’s got.

86
00:04:45.138 --> 00:04:47.847
The impression that I get
from the results that are filtering

87
00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:50.138
in is that those divisions now
are deeper than they

88
00:04:50.138 --> 00:04:51.222
were four years ago.

89
00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:54.638
It’s been a very, very difficult
time in American politics.

90
00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:57.722
And what does that say about
the appeal of the left in America?

91
00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:01.305
I think what it says is that we’ve
had a president over the last four

92
00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.972
years who has sought to stoke
division rather than calm those

93
00:05:03.972 --> 00:05:06.680
tensions and we’ve seen a lot
of that sort of politics,

94
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.430
that populist style
of politics, seeping over

95
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.347
here to the United Kingdom.

96
00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:14.972
Don’t forget, of course,
thatJoe Biden once famously

97
00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:18.180
described Boris Johnson
as a political and emotional clone

98
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.513
of Donald Trump and we’ve seen those
attempts by this government as well,

99
00:05:21.513 --> 00:05:24.347
to stoke those tensions,
to start culture wars and we’ve

100
00:05:24.347 --> 00:05:26.972
had a very, very angry,
divided debate over Brexit as well.

101
00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.097
But the thing is, Trump
has appealed to people?

102
00:05:29.097 --> 00:05:30.138
Well...

103
00:05:30.138 --> 00:05:31.597
There’s no getting away from that.

104
00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:34.472
It’s easier to win votes by stirring
people up against one another

105
00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:36.138
than it is to calm a situation.

106
00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:39.305
I think what this tells us
is that ifJoe Biden wins,

107
00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:42.138
as he’s expected but not guaranteed
to do, then he is going

108
00:05:42.138 --> 00:05:46.888
to have a very, very difficultjob
on his hands because he has to unite

109
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:50.847
the American people and hold them
together through what is widely

110
00:05:50.847 --> 00:05:55.180
expected to be the worst global
economic downturn in a century.

111
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.555
That is a huge challenge
and that is why I said this week

112
00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:01.472
that Britain has to really
step up now.

113
00:06:01.472 --> 00:06:04.472
Repair those relationships
with the Democrats,

114
00:06:04.472 --> 00:06:08.388
who are seriously concerned
about some of the actions

115
00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:11.513
of the British Government recently
and play our part in helping to make

116
00:06:11.513 --> 00:06:12.972
sure that we do pull together.

117
00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.638
The director—general
of the World Health Organization

118
00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:18.805
said recently that the biggest
challenge that we now face,

119
00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:22.097
globally, is not the virus itself
but the lack of solidarity —

120
00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:24.430
at both global and local levels.

121
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.597
So, there is a huge amount of work
to do in Britain has

122
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:28.763
to play its full part.

123
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.888
So, Rose McGowan, the question is,
does the fact that Donald Trump has

124
00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:34.763
gained more votes than he did
in 2016 show that his message

125
00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:38.930
resonates with more
of the American people?

126
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.347
I think it’s a little more
complicated than that.

127
00:06:41.347 --> 00:06:43.763
It’s not, you know...

128
00:06:43.763 --> 00:06:45.180
I used to be a Democrat.

129
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.805
I’m not a Republican.

130
00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:51.347
I’m kind of in a no men’s [and
but I grew up in a very

131
00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:53.805
unusual way in Italy,
in what they calla cult.

132
00:06:53.805 --> 00:06:56.472
And what I’ve seen now
on both sides is just that.

133
00:06:56.472 --> 00:06:59.305
You know, one side thinks
the other’s a cult, the other side

134
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:02.222
thinks the other’s a cult
and the answer is that it’s both.

135
00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:05.680
The answer is that the New York
Times, they think they might be more

136
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.555
erudite in telling you that
Hillary’s going to win

137
00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:13.597
so everyone’s shocked
but it’s not really reality.

138
00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:18.972
And the thing is, is that
with the council culture thing

139
00:07:22.972 --> 00:07:25.847
—— culture thing on the left,
which I’ve been a victim of,

140
00:07:25.847 --> 00:07:28.472
I’ve been cancelled many times,
but the thing of it is,

141
00:07:28.472 --> 00:07:32.055
is thatjust by not saying bad words
orjust by thinking a certain way

142
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:33.972
doesn’t make it that you’ve
actually accomplished anything.

143
00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:36.388
You know, the party line
when I was a Democrat

144
00:07:36.388 --> 00:07:39.055
that I was always fed
was we could accomplish so much

145
00:07:39.055 --> 00:07:40.472
if the Republicans wouldn’t stop us.

146
00:07:40.472 --> 00:07:42.888
Now, I was a lobbyist in DC,
I saw behind—the—scenes.

147
00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:45.305
A lot of them are incredibly similar
and incredibly tight,

148
00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:46.472
the left and the right.

149
00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:47.513
Donald Trump is...

150
00:07:47.513 --> 00:07:49.680
His message isjust,
you know, this isn’t working.

151
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.888
He doesn’t do it well,
he doesn’t speak well,

152
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.472
in my estimation, but he’s appealing
to people that are tired

153
00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:57.722
of being lied to.

154
00:07:57.722 --> 00:07:59.472
Now, he lies as well.

155
00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:02.305
So it’s very confusing but,
in a weird way, he’s a very

156
00:08:02.305 --> 00:08:06.305
sepia, transparent liar.

157
00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:08.222
When he does lie, we can see it.

158
00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:10.430
Whereas the other ones,
they hide it much better.

159
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.263
And I don’t think it’s
as easy as we need to join

160
00:08:13.263 --> 00:08:14.305
hands and sing Kumbaya.

161
00:08:14.305 --> 00:08:16.972
There’s a lot going down
in the US and it’s, frankly,

162
00:08:16.972 --> 00:08:20.055
it’s a weird opinion but it needs
to happen and it’s very sad

163
00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:22.972
but this is two sides,
they’ve been lied to for so long,

164
00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:27.972
that it’s very hard to see
the truth any more.

165
00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:29.847
There’s some hands up
amongst our audience.

166
00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:32.180
Alex?

167
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.680
I was going to agree
there with Rose.

168
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.263
I think it’s very easy to win votes
when you are not held to account

169
00:08:38.263 --> 00:08:39.305
for what you’re saying.

170
00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:41.763
I mean, we’ve seen even
in the past 2A hours,

171
00:08:41.763 --> 00:08:44.597
Trump and his party claiming to have
won elections that they haven’t

172
00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:46.972
and there don’t seem to be any
consequences for that.

173
00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:48.930
I think, again, that’s seeping
into British politics,

174
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.305
where people aren’t held to account
for what they say.

175
00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:53.263
There just doesn’t seem
to be any regulation

176
00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:56.180
of people’s claims in the past,
so it’s easy to win votes

177
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.513
when you just say what people
want to hear and they never have to

178
00:08:59.513 --> 00:09:00.597
follow up on them.

179
00:09:00.597 --> 00:09:03.055
Exactly the same point as Alex.

180
00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:07.097
I think there’sjust
so much misinformation out

181
00:09:07.097 --> 00:09:09.763
there and we are not all starting
at the same base,

182
00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:12.847
with the same truth.

183
00:09:12.847 --> 00:09:16.930
People have so much news from social
media and we don’t know what’s

184
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.930
truth and what’s lies.

185
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.097
So I think it’s just really
important to regulate, again,

186
00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:26.263
what Alex said, so people are not
allowed to say kind of lies

187
00:09:26.263 --> 00:09:31.305
and things like, you know,
world beating test entry

188
00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:33.180
—— and trace system
when they’re not.

189
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.180
And, Simon, when you talk
to people who support Trump,

190
00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:41.472
as Jan does, many will say, well,
that’s patronising to us.

191
00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:44.097
We know what we’re voting for,
we know what we’re hearing

192
00:09:44.097 --> 00:09:47.472
and we like it and don’t tell us
that we’re just being taken in.

193
00:09:47.472 --> 00:09:50.555
Clearly, we don’t know how this
election is yet going to turn out

194
00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:53.722
but what certainly has not happened
is that Biden is not romping home

195
00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:55.888
and Trump has not been
beaten into a corner.

196
00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:58.722
Yeah, look, I don’t know a huge
amount about what the people

197
00:09:58.722 --> 00:10:01.430
in America are thinking.

198
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.305
Lisa seems to be far more connected
to the entire American nation

199
00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:08.972
than I am but it does amaze me that
Trump has done so well.

200
00:10:08.972 --> 00:10:12.055
I think the question we’ve got
to ask is really about the political

201
00:10:12.055 --> 00:10:13.722
class in America and,
potentially, about our

202
00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:14.805
own political class.

203
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:17.180
We have to remember that Tmmp isn’t
a rareer politician.

204
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.388
He came from outside of politics.

205
00:10:19.388 --> 00:10:24.388
How has he managed to break into
this world and become president?

206
00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:28.680
The answer, I think,
comes down to the lack of connection

207
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.055
between the political class
and what people are thinking.

208
00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:34.430
And part of that, I think,
is that we have moved into a world

209
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.138
where people just aren’t prepared
to speak their mind.

210
00:10:37.138 --> 00:10:39.055
There’s just this lack
of authenticity, this fear...

211
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.222
Well, you can’t say that
of Donald Trump, surely?

212
00:10:41.222 --> 00:10:42.263
That’s right.

213
00:10:42.263 --> 00:10:43.722
That’s one thing he does do.

214
00:10:43.722 --> 00:10:47.055
No, that’s exactly right and I think
that is the only way I can

215
00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:48.513
explain his success,
is that he...

216
00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:52.347
You know, love him or hate him,
and I have to say, I would not vote

217
00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:53.805
for him, but he is authentic.

218
00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:56.430
He is speaking from the heart,
he is speaking his mind.

219
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.930
He doesn’t care what he says,
he doesn’t care about

220
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.638
the consequences and I think that
overly cautious approach that

221
00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:05.722
political classes around the world
are beginning to take and the sort

222
00:11:05.722 --> 00:11:09.805
of half answers that they’re forced
to being given, to give,

223
00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:13.972
means that people like Trump can
suddenly break through

224
00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:17.097
because they’re prepared
to speak their mind.

225
00:11:17.097 --> 00:11:20.972
I think it has to be a wake—up call
to our own political class to say,

226
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.347
come on, speak your mind,
stop following the party line,

227
00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:25.972
stop just saying what you think
you want us to hear,

228
00:11:25.972 --> 00:11:27.972
tell us what you really think.

229
00:11:27.972 --> 00:11:30.847
Well, we’ll be coming to you for
that, Oliver, in a minute.

230
00:11:30.847 --> 00:11:35.222
Tom?

231
00:11:35.222 --> 00:11:38.888
I broadly agree with what Simon said
there but I think what we should be

232
00:11:38.888 --> 00:11:41.013
looking at is Trump’s
messaging has been all around

233
00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:43.430
he’s the protector of the American
people, he’s America first,

234
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.305
he’s the protector of the economy,
he’s there for the average American.

235
00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.722
But I think what’s happened
is he’s connected 3 lot

236
00:11:48.722 --> 00:11:51.597
of those things with fear,
the things he says around the fact

237
00:11:51.597 --> 00:11:53.972
that if Biden wins there’ll be riots
and pitting different

238
00:11:53.972 --> 00:11:56.222
groups against each other,
such as immigrants and portraying

239
00:11:56.222 --> 00:11:58.930
them as threats and generally acting
like a bully and being

240
00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.972
really divisive.

241
00:11:59.972 --> 00:12:03.097
But I think what concerns me more
is the fact that how easy

242
00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:06.888
is that division to unpick,
even if Trump loses and Biden wins,

243
00:12:06.888 --> 00:12:11.930
are we ever going to get back
to a point in America

244
00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.513
where there’s less division
and at a much better point?

245
00:12:14.513 --> 00:12:16.305
Natalie?

246
00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:20.430
I was going to say, I think
with Trump, I’m no fan

247
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.180
but I think he’s very clever.

248
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.013
He’s a charismatic character.

249
00:12:25.013 --> 00:12:27.972
He knows his audience
really, really well.

250
00:12:27.972 --> 00:12:30.972
He knows how to deliver that message
that’s going to land

251
00:12:30.972 --> 00:12:33.388
with them and he’s got a lot
of loyal supporters.

252
00:12:33.388 --> 00:12:36.472
So, I’m really not surprised that
a lot of people have really turned

253
00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:38.138
out to vote for him this time.

254
00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:41.722
50, Hannah, the question is,
whether Trump wins or loses,

255
00:12:41.722 --> 00:12:45.222
and at the moment he’s not
looking on track to win

256
00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:48.138
but we still don’t know,
does the fact that he’s attracted

257
00:12:48.138 --> 00:12:50.055
more votes show his message
still resonates with

258
00:12:50.055 --> 00:12:52.347
the American people?

259
00:12:52.347 --> 00:12:55.138
I certainly think that
when you’re sitting on this

260
00:12:55.138 --> 00:12:57.513
side of the Atlantic,
it is extremely surprising that tens

261
00:12:57.513 --> 00:13:02.513
of millions of people
could possibly vote for Trump.

262
00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:06.055
I mean, I’ve got some basic
expectations from a president.

263
00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:09.888
Don’t make fun of disabled people,
you know, don’t solicit

264
00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:12.347
foreign interventions,
that kind of thing.

265
00:13:12.347 --> 00:13:14.805
I mean it’s really surprising,
you know, I accept that.

266
00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:17.430
But I think wondering why
voters in America didn’t

267
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.597
make the right choice,
as it were, is kind

268
00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:20.638
of the wrong question.

269
00:13:20.638 --> 00:13:21.888
Well, that wasn’t the question.

270
00:13:21.888 --> 00:13:24.347
That isn’t the question.

271
00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:28.847
No, I mean more as in the fact that
people are surprised,

272
00:13:28.847 --> 00:13:32.138
it sort of implies that we’re
wondering why people didn’t make

273
00:13:32.138 --> 00:13:35.513
a different decision and I think
that in a way that’s not the right

274
00:13:35.513 --> 00:13:37.180
way to think about things
because essentially,

275
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.763
you know, you’ve got all these
people who are overlooking concerns

276
00:13:40.763 --> 00:13:44.097
on sexual assaults, concerns on...

277
00:13:44.097 --> 00:13:46.972
Basically, playing fast and loose
with the Constitution

278
00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:49.722
and still choosing him
and I think...

279
00:13:49.722 --> 00:13:52.305
Why do you think they are?

280
00:13:52.305 --> 00:13:54.888
Well, I think it’s not
about whether people

281
00:13:54.888 --> 00:13:58.972
couldn’t be persuaded.

282
00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:01.305
I think it’s about people not
feeling like they’re represented.

283
00:14:01.305 --> 00:14:03.722
I think there are a lot
of people in America

284
00:14:03.722 --> 00:14:04.972
who are very deeply unhappy.

285
00:14:04.972 --> 00:14:09.722
There’s lots of studies
that show this.

286
00:14:09.722 --> 00:14:12.347
There’s a study that demonstrates
that well—being in America has been

287
00:14:12.347 --> 00:14:14.805
declining for 25 years,
particularly in prime age white men

288
00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:17.930
who have lower educational outcomes.

289
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.472
I mean, there are things like,
you know, opioid deaths,

290
00:14:21.472 --> 00:14:24.097
suicides, alcohol use —
all of that is in this group

291
00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:26.097
of people who are also Trump voters.

292
00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:29.680
I think unless you get to the core
of what it is that people

293
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.555
are unhappy about and why they don’t
feel like they are being

294
00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:35.472
represented, I think that’s the only
way that you’ll really answer why

295
00:14:35.472 --> 00:14:36.888
Trump is so appealing.

296
00:14:36.888 --> 00:14:38.805
I mean, obviously that’s
not all Trump voters,

297
00:14:38.805 --> 00:14:43.722
I’m sure Dan would say.

298
00:14:43.722 --> 00:14:44.888
—— Jan would say.

299
00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:45.930
Ricky?

300
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.972
Yes, thanks.

301
00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:51.930
Just going off what Tom’s just said,
I think ifJoe Biden does win,

302
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.430
that’s more than just his first
term, if he goes for a second term,

303
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.888
of rebuilding, really looking
at what a society does —

304
00:14:57.888 --> 00:15:01.555
we have to look after each other.

305
00:15:01.555 --> 00:15:03.472
The divide and conquer
or the division, we’ve

306
00:15:03.472 --> 00:15:04.722
had too much of that.

307
00:15:04.722 --> 00:15:06.388
How can we work for each other?

308
00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:09.805
I put a face mask on to protect
someone else, notjust for myself.

309
00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:12.347
The other point Ijust wanted
to raise was that there

310
00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:14.013
was an interesting piece
on Newsnight last

311
00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:15.097
night about polling.

312
00:15:15.097 --> 00:15:17.972
And how, actually, many people lie
to pollsters about who they actually

313
00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:20.347
are going to vote for and I wonder
whether there’s

314
00:15:20.347 --> 00:15:23.013
something similar here.

315
00:15:23.013 --> 00:15:26.888
Are people open with their political
views, and if not, why not?

316
00:15:26.888 --> 00:15:29.930
Abbie?

317
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.972
Thanks, Fiona.

318
00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:34.888
I mean, my sense is that it’s not
necessarily that his message

319
00:15:34.888 --> 00:15:37.972
resonates with people,
that Trump’s message resonates,

320
00:15:37.972 --> 00:15:41.138
it’s more coming back to the point
that I think Simon made before

321
00:15:41.138 --> 00:15:43.055
around the authenticity
and the transparency that Trump

322
00:15:43.055 --> 00:15:44.055
conveys to some people.

323
00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:47.472
I think people are fed up ofjust
hearing the party line and hearing

324
00:15:47.472 --> 00:15:51.680
politicians come out with very
rehearsed and very scripted

325
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.847
communications and what they’re
looking for is that transparency

326
00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:57.680
and that openness, that perception
of openness, at least.

327
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.847
Where Trump is on Twitter
all of the time, he gives them that,

328
00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:03.222
he gives them that sense
of transparency and that’s really

329
00:16:03.222 --> 00:16:04.222
what engenders their trust.

330
00:16:04.222 --> 00:16:06.638
To me, I think that’s actually more
compelling to people

331
00:16:06.638 --> 00:16:07.722
than his actual message.

332
00:16:07.722 --> 00:16:12.097
This is a fairly unique thing that
may be about to happen in America.

333
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:16.138
There have only been three occasions
in presidential election history

334
00:16:16.138 --> 00:16:19.722
where the sitting president has not
won a second term of office.

335
00:16:19.722 --> 00:16:23.513
So, this would be a big move
by the American people.

336
00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:27.597
I think there is a danger in this
debate that we give far too much

337
00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:30.222
credence to the idea that this
would be, in some senses,

338
00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:31.430
a victory for Donald Trump.

339
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.597
It would be an almost unique moment
in American history.

340
00:16:34.597 --> 00:16:37.180
Well, we’ve heard two people now
talk about how compelling openness

341
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.305
and transparency and authenticity
is from our politicians,

342
00:16:40.305 --> 00:16:42.805
which is obviously cue...

343
00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:45.388
We haven’t yet heard, we haven’t yet
heard from you, Oliver.

344
00:16:45.388 --> 00:16:47.305
So, I want to hearfrom you.

345
00:16:47.305 --> 00:16:49.763
We don’t want any party lines
tonight, absolutely.

346
00:16:49.763 --> 00:16:51.930
So...

347
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.972
A Trump win would be better
for the Government, wouldn’t it?

348
00:16:57.055 --> 00:16:59.513
No, not at all.

349
00:16:59.513 --> 00:17:01.430
We, in the UK, have
worked with Presidents

350
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.472
from both persuasions.

351
00:17:02.472 --> 00:17:04.388
I’ve seen it myself
when I first started...

352
00:17:04.388 --> 00:17:06.055
I know, but at least you’ve met...

353
00:17:06.055 --> 00:17:07.972
At least the government,
at least Boris Johnson

354
00:17:07.972 --> 00:17:15.347
has met Donald Trump,
hasn’t even spoken toJoe Biden.

355
00:17:30.888 --> 00:17:32.847
Worked very effectively
with Barack Obama for many years.

356
00:17:32.847 --> 00:17:35.222
Theresa May and, indeed,
BorisJohnson have worked very well

357
00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:36.305
with President Trump.

358
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.972
And I’d certainly given up
as a politician trying to predict

359
00:17:38.972 --> 00:17:41.347
elections in this country,
let alone in the United States.

360
00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:43.972
But I think one thing is areal
cause for celebration,

361
00:17:43.972 --> 00:17:46.888
is the fact that the greatest nation
in the world, in terms

362
00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:48.555
of its military power,
its economic power,

363
00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:50.472
is deciding its fate,
not like the most...

364
00:17:50.472 --> 00:17:53.097
Most of the rest of the world,
it’s not being decided

365
00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:54.097
by a political elite.

366
00:17:54.097 --> 00:17:57.263
It’s not being decided by the army,
it’s being decided by the people

367
00:17:57.263 --> 00:17:59.430
of America and I think that’s
a fantastic thing.

368
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.263
What do you think about the fact
that Donald Trump is trying...

369
00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:04.722
Depending on your point of view,
some would say interfere,

370
00:18:04.722 --> 00:18:06.347
some would say correct,
the results coming

371
00:18:06.347 --> 00:18:07.805
in from the election?

372
00:18:07.805 --> 00:18:11.805
He’s talked about fraud,
he’s talked about corruption

373
00:18:11.805 --> 00:18:14.430
and he’s got legal suites
going in a number of states.

374
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.055
We are well used to this happening
in the United States

375
00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.055
and it’s happened...

376
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.097
No, we are...

377
00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.347
What we’re not used to...

378
00:18:20.347 --> 00:18:23.472
Hang on, what we are not used
to is a sitting president accusing,

379
00:18:23.472 --> 00:18:25.638
saying that the electoral system
is fraudulent and corrupt.

380
00:18:25.638 --> 00:18:27.055
I can’t think of a time...

381
00:18:27.055 --> 00:18:30.638
If you go back to the 2000 election,
similarly it ended up in the courts.

382
00:18:30.638 --> 00:18:32.055
It wasn’t about fraud or corruption.

383
00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:34.722
But what is enduring about
the United States, and indeed this

384
00:18:34.722 --> 00:18:37.347
country, is that our nations
are built on these democratic values

385
00:18:37.347 --> 00:18:39.972
and, in fact, this weekend,
as we look to the Armistice,

386
00:18:39.972 --> 00:18:41.430
those are the values we share.

387
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.597
Those are the values
we fought and died for,

388
00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:45.763
and I’m absolutely sure
that the US Constitution can

389
00:18:45.763 --> 00:18:47.888
withstand either the continuation
or the change of president,

390
00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:49.555
depending on what the American
people decide.

391
00:18:49.555 --> 00:18:52.388
Jan, since you’re being good enough
tojoin us for this part

392
00:18:52.388 --> 00:18:55.055
of the debate this evening,
I just wonder what your response

393
00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:57.472
is or what your view
is of President Trump’s comments

394
00:18:57.472 --> 00:19:00.013
about fraud and corruption
in the electoral system?

395
00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:02.930
Well, there’s a couple of points
that I would like to make.

396
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.805
Trump...

397
00:19:04.805 --> 00:19:07.388
The people that didn’t vote
for Trump in the last election

398
00:19:07.388 --> 00:19:10.055
and voted for him in this election
was because he delivered

399
00:19:10.055 --> 00:19:11.263
on every promise he made.

400
00:19:11.263 --> 00:19:14.388
I have friends who can’t stand
to listen to him and they don’t,

401
00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:19.430
but they support, they vote
for him and...

402
00:19:21.513 --> 00:19:23.180
He hasn’t quite delivered
on every promise.

403
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.847
I mean, the Mexicans haven’t paid
for the wall, have they,

404
00:19:25.847 --> 00:19:30.888
as far as I’m aware?

405
00:19:32.847 --> 00:19:34.430
Um...oh!

406
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.430
SHE LAUGHS

407
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.472
Well, you know...

408
00:19:36.472 --> 00:19:38.138
Every one apart from that one, then?

409
00:19:38.138 --> 00:19:43.138
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:50.805
But really critical
and for 30 years, actually,

411
00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:53.972
I would even say A0 years,
we have had a very divisive nation

412
00:19:53.972 --> 00:19:57.055
and I don’t believe that Biden’s
going to be able to pull it

413
00:19:57.055 --> 00:19:59.680
together but where Trump made
a mistake is that with Covid,

414
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.722
people were exhausted.

415
00:20:00.722 --> 00:20:03.888
People were hurting and so he didn’t
show enough empathy to reach out

416
00:20:03.888 --> 00:20:05.263
for those people tojoin him.

417
00:20:05.263 --> 00:20:07.430
I agree that sometimes
I just want to say,

418
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.430
"could you keep your mouth shut?"
but he knows what he’s doing.

419
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:24.638
Az, you have your hand up?

420
00:20:24.638 --> 00:20:27.513
Thank you.

421
00:20:27.513 --> 00:20:28.722
It’s a typical Trump thing.

422
00:20:28.722 --> 00:20:30.638
He’s completely divisive.

423
00:20:30.638 --> 00:20:35.597
This is what he always does.

424
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.263
In the first debate, you saw him
just interrupting Biden constantly

425
00:20:43.263 --> 00:20:45.430
and this is him yet
again doing thse things.

426
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.597
And to say that people are voting
for him more now than before,

427
00:20:48.597 --> 00:20:50.972
it’s just because those Republicans
who didn’t vote last time

428
00:20:50.972 --> 00:20:54.305
are now scared about Biden.

429
00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:56.680
That’s the only reason
that the votes have gone up,

430
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.722
nothing to do with what he’s done.

431
00:20:58.722 --> 00:20:59.763
It’s not his policies.

432
00:20:59.763 --> 00:21:04.430
So it’s a fallacy, sorry.

433
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.180
It is!

434
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.263
Jan, sorry.

435
00:21:11.263 --> 00:21:12.305
It is his policies.

436
00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:16.722
You know, to make that kind
of blanket assumption...

437
00:21:16.722 --> 00:21:18.638
We ended up having,
in the different rallies,

438
00:21:18.638 --> 00:21:21.055
we registered Democrats
who were going to vote for him,

439
00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:26.013
so it’s notjust the Republicans.

440
00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:30.930
And the fear on the Democrats’ side
was because Bernie Sanders

441
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.305
and Alexandria Ocasio—Cortez
were so vocal and have an incredible

442
00:21:33.305 --> 00:21:35.930
following, there was a fear
that we were going to go

443
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.972
really far left.

444
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:52.138
But what came out was
that they really do believe that

445
00:21:55.097 --> 00:21:58.138
Biden is more moderate and the blue
wave didn’t happen, and they ended

446
00:21:58.138 --> 00:22:01.055
up losing in the House
and in the Senate, but it really

447
00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:03.972
made a statement that the voters
want us to come together more

448
00:22:03.972 --> 00:22:08.930
because we have got to get back
to being moderate.

449
00:22:11.722 --> 00:22:15.972
Rose?

450
00:22:15.972 --> 00:22:18.388
I think what maybe people
don’t quite get is that

451
00:22:18.388 --> 00:22:23.430
America’s not a democracy —
it’s an oligarchy.

452
00:22:23.722 --> 00:22:26.930
It’s run by corporations and as many
Democrats and as many Republicans

453
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.972
have been presidents, really,
in the last 30 to A0 years, it’s

454
00:22:33.597 --> 00:22:35.263
gone, like, on high
in that direction.

455
00:22:35.263 --> 00:22:37.680
You know, yes, do the Democrats
hear what people want?

456
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.722
Yes.

457
00:22:38.722 --> 00:22:39.722
Do they do it?

458
00:22:39.722 --> 00:22:40.763
No.

459
00:22:40.763 --> 00:22:43.430
Because it’s been proven and studied
that only if it’s something

460
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:48.388
that the corporations want as well,
then it’ll happen, but if it’s

461
00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:51.097
people that want it, "Ah,
there’s other people to blame."

462
00:22:51.097 --> 00:22:52.805
What I continually
hear is Trump bashing.

463
00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:54.263
It’s very easy to bash him.

464
00:22:54.263 --> 00:22:56.888
I’m not saying I don’t,
but I’m saying in this moment,

465
00:22:56.888 --> 00:22:58.597
you know, you’re talking
about credibly accused

466
00:22:58.597 --> 00:22:59.597
of sexual assault.

467
00:22:59.597 --> 00:23:02.263
That’s been really kept out
of the headlines withJoe Biden.

468
00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:03.680
And there’s people that are just...

469
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.638
Which he’s denied,
of course, I have to say.

470
00:23:06.638 --> 00:23:07.722
Of course, alleged.

471
00:23:07.722 --> 00:23:12.680
It’s corruption on both sides.

472
00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:17.722
It’s notjust one, it’s that xcept
one has better optics.

473
00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:19.138
And that would be the Democrats.

474
00:23:19.138 --> 00:23:20.180
Rebecca?

475
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.222
Hi, there.

476
00:23:21.222 --> 00:23:23.847
I’d like to come back to something
I think Lisa mentioned,

477
00:23:23.847 --> 00:23:26.763
that this isn’t a victory for Trump
but at the same time

478
00:23:26.763 --> 00:23:28.680
it’s clearly not a victory
for Biden, outright,

479
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.680
at the moment, either.

480
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.722
And I think that’s something that’s
really important from this election,

481
00:23:36.138 --> 00:23:39.305
I think it enables us to look
a little bit into the future.

482
00:23:39.305 --> 00:23:41.972
Many of the same cultural issues
that are affecting the US,

483
00:23:41.972 --> 00:23:43.388
we see in our own electorate.

484
00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:48.347
And what’s clearly the case
is that these approaches,

485
00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:51.222
just being kind of anti—Trump
and just being less extreme

486
00:23:51.222 --> 00:23:52.305
isn’t cutting through.

487
00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:54.680
So I think there’s something
that needs to be thought

488
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.347
through from our opposition parties,
about how they can actually deal

489
00:23:57.347 --> 00:23:59.722
with some of these issues and bring
people back together.

490
00:23:59.722 --> 00:24:04.722
Caroline?

491
00:24:06.013 --> 00:24:09.347
I was going to go back to Jan’s
point about the coronavirus and ask,

492
00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:11.763
do you think Trump’s attitude
towards the virus has potentially

493
00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:14.388
put Americans off voting for him,
if the vote does go

494
00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:15.388
more towards Biden?

495
00:24:15.388 --> 00:24:17.805
Well, Ithink, Jan, that’s
what you’re saying, isn’t it?

496
00:24:17.805 --> 00:24:19.722
That that’s something that
has perhaps cost Trump?

497
00:24:19.722 --> 00:24:24.763
It did, it did cost Trump.

498
00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:32.513
There were many of his supporters
who voted for him that...

499
00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:35.138
Because in press conferences,
he was up front, saying I need

500
00:24:35.138 --> 00:24:37.305
to be a cheerleader,
I don’t want the people

501
00:24:37.305 --> 00:24:42.180
to get in panic.

502
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.805
But he didn’t come out with any
sensitivity, and I’ll tell

503
00:24:44.805 --> 00:24:46.972
you the other thing that
really has bothered me,

504
00:24:46.972 --> 00:24:51.972
is that in his rallies of the last
few days before we voted,

505
00:24:55.555 --> 00:25:00.555
was he was using himself as,
"Look how quickly I got over Covid

506
00:25:00.597 --> 00:25:00.680
because we have remdesivir."

507
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:09.972
And that doesn’t make people feel
that he is focusing on getting

508
00:25:10.722 --> 00:25:15.722
things done, because he keeps
talking about the vaccine.

509
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.930
But he’s not saying anything
about the people that have lost

510
00:25:23.472 --> 00:25:26.555
people, and the fact that one month
Fauci was telling us no masks,

511
00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:29.263
then the next month, masks are good.

512
00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:34.305
And he’s the president,
so he’s getting the blame.

513
00:25:36.013 --> 00:25:40.972
But if I could also add —
I don’t know if you have this

514
00:25:41.805 --> 00:25:46.805
perspective, that it’s notjust
Trump that has his lawyers

515
00:25:47.972 --> 00:25:51.305
going, because Biden had his lawyers
going to try to get voter ID off,

516
00:25:51.305 --> 00:25:56.138
no signature needed...

517
00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:58.055
No, no, we’ve seen
that there are legal

518
00:25:58.055 --> 00:25:59.972
cases that have been
brought on both sides.

519
00:25:59.972 --> 00:26:02.638
There is only one person who has
accused the electoral system

520
00:26:02.638 --> 00:26:04.555
of fraud and corruption,
which is Donald Trump,

521
00:26:04.555 --> 00:26:07.888
which is the reason I mentioned it.

522
00:26:07.888 --> 00:26:10.722
Listen, I think we could talk
about the election for some time.

523
00:26:10.722 --> 00:26:13.888
We don’t have the result —
I thought we might get it tonight,

524
00:26:13.888 --> 00:26:15.555
it doesn’t look like we’re going to.

525
00:26:15.555 --> 00:26:17.972
Maybe when we wake up tomorrow,
we’ll have the result.

526
00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:20.805
So I’m going to move onto another
topic, but for now, Jan,

527
00:26:20.805 --> 00:26:23.972
I just want to thank you forjoining
us in giving us your

528
00:26:23.972 --> 00:26:24.972
perspective on this.

529
00:26:24.972 --> 00:26:27.388
It’s obviously very interesting
hearing what you had to say.

530
00:26:27.388 --> 00:26:28.597
Thank you very much indeed.

531
00:26:28.597 --> 00:26:30.972
And, before we carry on,
I just want to mention

532
00:26:30.972 --> 00:26:33.680
that we are looking for people
to join our virtual audience

533
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680
for programmes to come.

534
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.555
So next week we will be, virtually,
in Dover and the week

535
00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:38.597
after that, Windsor.

536
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:41.222
So if you live there
or thereabouts, do get in touch

537
00:26:41.222 --> 00:26:42.430
on the Question Time website.

538
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.097
You can fill out the form
there and come and be

539
00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:46.763
part of our audience,
from the luxury

540
00:26:46.763 --> 00:26:47.847
of your sitting room.

541
00:26:47.847 --> 00:26:49.972
You can sit there with a cup of tea.

542
00:26:49.972 --> 00:26:53.305
It would be very good to have you,
so do please get in touch.

543
00:26:53.305 --> 00:26:55.972
Right, let’s take our next question
now from A2, A2 Nandoo.

544
00:26:55.972 --> 00:26:56.972
Thank you, Fiona.

545
00:26:56.972 --> 00:26:59.888
Is the new lockdown going to extend
beyond the 2nd of December,

546
00:26:59.888 --> 00:27:01.805
as this is a pseudo—lockdown
compared to March?

547
00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:05.430
And what do you mean
by a pseudo—lockdown?

548
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.597
It’s...
This is not a lockdown.

549
00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:11.680
In March...

550
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.805
It’s hard to say.

551
00:27:12.805 --> 00:27:17.638
I think everybody’s tired
of lockdowns anyway,

552
00:27:17.638 --> 00:27:20.555
but this is a strange one
where we’ve got children still going

553
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:22.680
to school and university,
which is great, their education.

554
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.805
But then we’ve got...

555
00:27:25.805 --> 00:27:28.680
It’s a mixed bag, because you’ve got
kids who go to school,

556
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.055
play football with their friends,
then when they go home,

557
00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:34.222
they can’t go and meet their friends
because they’re not in the school.

558
00:27:34.222 --> 00:27:35.347
So they’re already mixing...

559
00:27:35.347 --> 00:27:37.263
Everything we’re doing
at the moment, it’s not

560
00:27:37.263 --> 00:27:38.305
going to change anything.

561
00:27:38.305 --> 00:27:43.305
It’s pretty much the same.

562
00:27:50.513 --> 00:27:54.972
People today, listening
to the traffic reports,

563
00:27:54.972 --> 00:27:57.138
when the first lockdown happened,
the traffic was zero.

564
00:27:57.138 --> 00:27:59.263
Everything locked down,
no shops open, no movement.

565
00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:04.263
Now, today, everything’s exactly
the same as it was yesterday.

566
00:28:07.847 --> 00:28:12.513
And so what you’re asking is,
is the new lockdown,

567
00:28:12.513 --> 00:28:15.638
such as it is, you clearly feel —
you’re calling it a pseudo—lockdown,

568
00:28:15.638 --> 00:28:18.055
is it going to extend
beyond the 2nd of December?

569
00:28:18.055 --> 00:28:22.180
Well, is it, Oliver?

570
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.263
Absolutely.

571
00:28:23.263 --> 00:28:26.097
No, the regulations will expire
on the 2nd of December and it

572
00:28:26.097 --> 00:28:28.763
would have to be for Parliament
to come back and vote

573
00:28:28.763 --> 00:28:31.597
for further measures and we’ve
indicated that we want to go back

574
00:28:31.597 --> 00:28:32.638
to the tiered system.

575
00:28:32.638 --> 00:28:37.555
And I completely
agree with what Az...

576
00:28:37.555 --> 00:28:39.722
Yes, but, in a sense,
that’s important, but it’s

577
00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:40.763
kind of a technicality.

578
00:28:40.763 --> 00:28:42.930
Are you expecting, as
the Government, that the lockdown,

579
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.972
such as we have it, will end
on the 2nd or are you actually

580
00:28:49.972 --> 00:28:53.013
thinking, "Hmm, we’ll probably have
to go back and ask to extend it"?

581
00:28:53.013 --> 00:28:55.472
No, we’re expecting the lockdown
will end on the 2nd,

582
00:28:55.472 --> 00:28:58.805
when the Cabinet discussed it,
and I have to say it was a very

583
00:28:58.805 --> 00:29:01.180
sombre discussion that we had
on Saturday, the clear advice

584
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.263
we had was twofold.

585
00:29:02.263 --> 00:29:04.680
First of all, that if we didn’t
take these measures,

586
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.847
the NHS risked being overwhelmed.

587
00:29:05.847 --> 00:29:07.972
And what that means,
for people watching and listening

588
00:29:07.972 --> 00:29:10.680
at home, is that we’d
be in a situation where people

589
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.013
could turn up at NHS
hospitals and be turned away

590
00:29:13.013 --> 00:29:15.430
for treatment even though
they needed it and we couldn’t

591
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.472
allow that to happen.

592
00:29:16.472 --> 00:29:17.555
Well, people are...

593
00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:20.180
I completely agree with what Az
said, about how fed up

594
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.180
we are with lockdown.

595
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.597
As far as non—elective surgery goes,
people are not getting

596
00:29:23.597 --> 00:29:24.638
that treatment now.

597
00:29:24.638 --> 00:29:26.847
Well, in respect of non—elective
surgery, they’ve actually taken

598
00:29:26.847 --> 00:29:29.222
a lot of measures in relation
to getting elective surgery

599
00:29:29.222 --> 00:29:30.263
back up and running.

600
00:29:30.263 --> 00:29:32.638
But there are some hospitals
where it’s not happening already.

601
00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:35.263
Well, and we cannot have that
happening on a national basis,

602
00:29:35.263 --> 00:29:37.472
which is why we had
to take these measures.

603
00:29:37.472 --> 00:29:40.347
And the second piece of advice
we had was that our understanding

604
00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:43.180
is this will be sufficient
to suppress the R and to ensure

605
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.347
that we can then emerge
from the lockdown at

606
00:29:45.347 --> 00:29:47.055
the beginning of December.

607
00:29:47.055 --> 00:29:49.722
That is why these regulations,
they don’t roll over, they expire.

608
00:29:49.722 --> 00:29:52.888
The Government would have to come
back to Parliament in order to get

609
00:29:52.888 --> 00:29:55.472
afresh consent and we believe
that these measures are sufficient.

610
00:29:55.472 --> 00:29:58.055
Hannah?

611
00:29:58.055 --> 00:30:03.055
Sufficient for what, though,
I think is the question?

612
00:30:03.055 --> 00:30:06.097
Because I think what A2 is saying
is really important,

613
00:30:06.097 --> 00:30:08.763
about how this lockdown just
feels very different.

614
00:30:08.763 --> 00:30:12.847
You walk out in the street, there’s
people everywhere and, essentially,

615
00:30:12.847 --> 00:30:15.222
that is going to be reflected
in the reproduction number.

616
00:30:15.222 --> 00:30:17.597
Last time, we had a reproduction
number ofabout 0.6,

617
00:30:17.597 --> 00:30:19.305
which meant the virus
was radically declining.

618
00:30:19.305 --> 00:30:21.680
This time, maybe we’re
going to be at 0.8, 0.95.

619
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.972
That doesn’t sound like that much
of a difference but it makes

620
00:30:24.972 --> 00:30:29.972
a dramatic difference to how
quickly things turn.

621
00:30:31.305 --> 00:30:36.138
I think that as also picked
up on in that point,

622
00:30:36.138 --> 00:30:39.055
the fact a lot of the messaging
here feels a bit contradictory.

623
00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:41.972
You can play with your friends
in school, but you can’t play

624
00:30:41.972 --> 00:30:42.972
with them after school.

625
00:30:42.972 --> 00:30:46.597
And in the tier system, you can
drink but only if you’ve got a pie

626
00:30:46.597 --> 00:30:48.013
or a chip butty with you.

627
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:50.680
I think you might have
to have a salad as well.

628
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.680
0h, do you?
0K.

629
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.847
Maybe that was a couple of weeks
ago, it’s easy to lose track!

630
00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:57.222
It would definitely be a pie,
from a Wigan perspective!

631
00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:59.597
And I think that is one
of the big problems

632
00:30:59.597 --> 00:31:02.972
that we are in at the moment, which
is that actually I think people

633
00:31:02.972 --> 00:31:05.388
are struggling to adhere
to the basic measures and, actually,

634
00:31:05.388 --> 00:31:09.555
the adherence is the thing
that is so important.

635
00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:11.138
You know, we’ve had...

636
00:31:11.138 --> 00:31:12.888
There’s been a lack
of consistency too.

637
00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:15.763
I think when we were in spring,
there really should have been

638
00:31:15.763 --> 00:31:18.347
a message that a winter lockdown
was a really strong possibility

639
00:31:18.347 --> 00:31:21.763
and I think with Eat Out to Help Out
and get back to work,

640
00:31:21.763 --> 00:31:24.638
we sort of screeched into everything
being open and now we’re sort

641
00:31:24.638 --> 00:31:26.138
of screeching back into everything
being shut again.

642
00:31:26.138 --> 00:31:28.305
I think that’s really
hard to stay up with.

643
00:31:28.722 --> 00:31:31.388
I think the final thing
to say is that I think

644
00:31:31.388 --> 00:31:33.555
the real focus so far has
been very authoritative.

645
00:31:33.555 --> 00:31:35.472
All the measures have been very
authoritative, right?

646
00:31:35.472 --> 00:31:37.638
It’s like, 0K, Rule of Six,
10pm closing, fines,

647
00:31:37.638 --> 00:31:40.722
we’ll give your name and number
to the police, that kind of thing.

648
00:31:40.722 --> 00:31:43.638
And, actually, lots of the evidence
shows that that doesn’t really make

649
00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:46.180
that much of a difference...

650
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.180
Only about 20% of people,
apparently self—isolated.

651
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:53.097
That’s exactly right, exactly that.

652
00:31:53.097 --> 00:31:55.972
Only 20% of people who are asked
to are fully self—isolating and,

653
00:31:55.972 --> 00:31:58.888
actually, if you could find out
what it is that is stopping

654
00:31:58.888 --> 00:32:00.805
people from self—isolating
and support them through it,

655
00:32:00.805 --> 00:32:04.138
you know, Ijust think it would make
so much more of a difference.

656
00:32:04.138 --> 00:32:06.513
The effectiveness of that
would be so much greater.

657
00:32:06.513 --> 00:32:08.930
Whereas I think when measures
are presented as though they’re

658
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.263
punitive, I think itjust breeds
resentment and stops people

659
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:16.305
wanting to conform to them,
exactly as A2 is saying.

660
00:32:18.305 --> 00:32:20.055
Martin?

661
00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:24.055
I agree with the points that Az made
but I would say I do think

662
00:32:24.055 --> 00:32:26.472
we have to take a bit
of collective responsibility here.

663
00:32:26.472 --> 00:32:29.222
I think we’ve arrived at this
lockdown because people have been

664
00:32:29.222 --> 00:32:31.388
breaking rules and not adhering
to the previous tiering

665
00:32:31.388 --> 00:32:36.347
systems that were set.

666
00:32:38.055 --> 00:32:42.722
In fact, unfortunately,
the politicians have a lot to answer

667
00:32:42.722 --> 00:32:45.555
for here and there doesn’t seem
to have been enough full punishment

668
00:32:45.555 --> 00:32:50.263
for when rules have been broken.

669
00:32:50.263 --> 00:32:53.347
So, I would encourage
everybody to step up now.

670
00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:57.305
The quicker we properly follow
these new restrictions,

671
00:32:57.305 --> 00:33:02.263
the quicker we’ll be able
to come out of them.

672
00:33:02.722 --> 00:33:05.888
Ricky?

673
00:33:05.888 --> 00:33:07.513
To reiterate what Keir
Starmer said earlier...

674
00:33:07.513 --> 00:33:08.972
How did we get to this?

675
00:33:08.972 --> 00:33:10.805
People are fatigued,
people are frustrated.

676
00:33:10.805 --> 00:33:15.597
They don’t have any trust,
they don’t have any faith.

677
00:33:15.597 --> 00:33:18.222
And people who I would consider
really straight down the book,

678
00:33:18.222 --> 00:33:23.263
you know, people who are proud
about how they take their collective

679
00:33:23.347 --> 00:33:24.972
responsibility, they are fed
up, bored, frustrated.

680
00:33:24.972 --> 00:33:29.972
They’ve had enough.

681
00:33:31.388 --> 00:33:33.805
We need absolute transparency,
we need clarity and we need

682
00:33:33.805 --> 00:33:36.972
leadership, a road map for how
on earth we’re going to get out

683
00:33:36.972 --> 00:33:39.263
of this, how are we going
live with this virus?

684
00:33:39.263 --> 00:33:40.972
The vaccine is not a silver bullet.

685
00:33:40.972 --> 00:33:43.055
This thing is here.

686
00:33:43.055 --> 00:33:45.472
We’ve got to find a way
of working with it.

687
00:33:45.472 --> 00:33:48.138
And, Mr Dowden, we need confidence
in you and your government.

688
00:33:48.138 --> 00:33:50.597
We absolutely need it.

689
00:33:50.597 --> 00:33:55.013
So let’s start being really,
really clear about this.

690
00:33:55.013 --> 00:33:58.388
There’s no way this is going to end
December the 2nd, so let’s start

691
00:33:58.388 --> 00:33:59.430
being clear about that.

692
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.847
And let’s be honest,
open and find a road map.

693
00:34:01.847 --> 00:34:03.013
We’ve got to work together.

694
00:34:03.013 --> 00:34:07.888
It’s not going to end
on December the 2nd.

695
00:34:07.888 --> 00:34:10.263
Well, I set out the position
that we believe this

696
00:34:10.263 --> 00:34:11.305
would be sufficient.

697
00:34:11.305 --> 00:34:14.180
I think, and many of these
contributors have made

698
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.597
a svery important point,
Ricky and Az and others —

699
00:34:16.597 --> 00:34:18.013
people are fed up with this.

700
00:34:18.013 --> 00:34:19.972
Of course they are
fed up with this...

701
00:34:19.972 --> 00:34:22.097
What about Ricky’s point,
that he hasn’t got confidence?

702
00:34:22.097 --> 00:34:24.513
Well, it is worth noting
that we are not unique

703
00:34:24.513 --> 00:34:25.555
in the United Kingdom.

704
00:34:25.555 --> 00:34:28.680
In France, in Spain, across Europe,
we are seeing the virus come back

705
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.722
during the autumn months.

706
00:34:29.722 --> 00:34:32.597
Now, initially, because of this
fatigue, we wanted to try and ensure

707
00:34:32.597 --> 00:34:34.263
that we could have a tiered system.

708
00:34:34.263 --> 00:34:37.180
Now, that tiered system worked,
and we are getting the numbers under

709
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.347
control, but it wasn’t sufficient.

710
00:34:38.347 --> 00:34:41.013
We saw in places like
the south—west, where the levels had

711
00:34:41.013 --> 00:34:44.347
been flat, suddenly starting
to shoot up.

712
00:34:44.347 --> 00:34:46.222
That’s why we’ve had
to take these measures.

713
00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:48.388
But the point that Ricky
made about other things,

714
00:34:48.388 --> 00:34:50.847
of course the vaccine alone won’t be
a silver bullet.

715
00:34:50.847 --> 00:34:53.513
That’s why we are rolling out mass
testing, so for example

716
00:34:53.513 --> 00:34:55.180
in Liverpool right now,
starting tomorrow, we’ll

717
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.638
be testing everyone,
both those with symptoms and those

718
00:34:57.638 --> 00:34:59.805
not, so that we can start
identifying it better.

719
00:34:59.805 --> 00:35:02.388
And in addition to that,
we are making huge clinical advances

720
00:35:02.388 --> 00:35:03.638
in terms of our treatment.

721
00:35:03.638 --> 00:35:06.722
If you look at the mortality rate,
the number of people that die

722
00:35:06.722 --> 00:35:10.722
from Covid is falling as we make
advances with drugs and others.

723
00:35:10.722 --> 00:35:12.638
So we’re notjust
relying on the vaccine.

724
00:35:12.638 --> 00:35:15.597
This will buy us some space.

725
00:35:15.597 --> 00:35:18.388
On the point of Liverpool,
how is it that a country

726
00:35:18.388 --> 00:35:21.138
like Slovenia, for example,
is able to test 3.5 million people

727
00:35:21.138 --> 00:35:24.222
last week, over a weekend...

728
00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:29.263
Slovakia, sorry, not Slovenia.

729
00:35:30.305 --> 00:35:34.597
And yet and yet — and they’re in no
way as well the country as we are —

730
00:35:34.597 --> 00:35:37.222
and the Government is very proud
of this pilot in Liverpool.

731
00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:39.138
But they’re way ahead
of us, in Slovakia.

732
00:35:39.138 --> 00:35:42.305
First of all, we are doing it
in Liverpool, but it’s also worth

733
00:35:42.305 --> 00:35:43.305
looking at comparisons elsewhere.

734
00:35:43.305 --> 00:35:44.347
We have ramped up...

735
00:35:44.347 --> 00:35:46.013
Well, Ijust give a new one.

736
00:35:46.013 --> 00:35:49.680
How is it they are able to do
something like that and we are not?

737
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.013
If you look at a country
like France or Germany,

738
00:35:52.013 --> 00:35:54.180
most other European countries,
with increased our capacity more.

739
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.347
We are much bigger country
in the United Kingdom.

740
00:35:56.347 --> 00:35:58.263
We’ve gone from about
2000 tests inJanuary

741
00:35:58.263 --> 00:36:00.680
to an availability of 500,000 now,
and we are continuing

742
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.930
to ramp it up further.

743
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:02.930
That’s been...

744
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.847
We’re not actually doing
500,000, though, are we?

745
00:36:04.847 --> 00:36:06.055
We’re doing much less that.

746
00:36:06.055 --> 00:36:07.097
Deborah?

747
00:36:07.097 --> 00:36:09.263
I’m confused as to why
the Government was listening

748
00:36:09.263 --> 00:36:11.638
to the scientists when they said
that lockdowns really work

749
00:36:11.638 --> 00:36:14.805
when the R rate is lower,
but aren’t we just two weeks too

750
00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:16.763
late for this lockdown?

751
00:36:16.763 --> 00:36:21.013
Alex?

752
00:36:21.013 --> 00:36:23.638
I’m actually a few months’
pregnant so I got a specific

753
00:36:23.638 --> 00:36:27.347
question for Oliver.

754
00:36:27.347 --> 00:36:30.597
There’s been a report released
today which that shows

755
00:36:30.597 --> 00:36:32.513
that in this lockdown,
employers are being left

756
00:36:32.513 --> 00:36:34.930
to their own discretion to decide
whether pregnant women have

757
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.763
to come into work or not,
whereas in the first lockdown women

758
00:36:37.763 --> 00:36:39.180
effectively shielded
when they were pregnant,

759
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.847
given the amount of strain they’ve
already got on their bodies.

760
00:36:41.847 --> 00:36:44.263
What is the Government going do
to protect pregnant women

761
00:36:44.263 --> 00:36:46.180
from discrimination to ensure
they can actually protect

762
00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.222
themselves in this pandemic?

763
00:36:47.222 --> 00:36:50.847
I’m going to get round the rest
of the panel, so if you could just

764
00:36:50.847 --> 00:36:51.888
answer that briefly.

765
00:36:51.888 --> 00:36:53.263
I think it’s an important point.

766
00:36:53.263 --> 00:36:56.180
First of all, employers have to make
sure their workplace is safe,

767
00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.097
and they are also subject
to non—discrimination laws.

768
00:36:58.097 --> 00:36:59.805
So, they should not be
discriminating against

769
00:36:59.805 --> 00:37:02.430
women who are pregnant
on the basis of them being pregnant.

770
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.430
I’m not...

771
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.930
Does not answer your question, Alex?

772
00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:05.930
Not really.

773
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.055
No, Alex wanted to know
what her rights are,

774
00:37:08.055 --> 00:37:11.722
whether or not she has the right
to not go to work, as she did

775
00:37:11.722 --> 00:37:13.388
in the first lockdown,
because she’s pregnant.

776
00:37:13.388 --> 00:37:17.222
So she has a right to have a safe
place to work, and she should be

777
00:37:17.222 --> 00:37:19.888
able to go in there and work
as a pregnant person.

778
00:37:19.888 --> 00:37:22.972
If she can’t go in there and work
as a pregnant woman, then

779
00:37:22.972 --> 00:37:24.013
she shouldn’t go in.

780
00:37:24.013 --> 00:37:26.888
If it’s not a safe environment,
she shouldn’t go in and has

781
00:37:26.888 --> 00:37:28.347
a right not to go in.

782
00:37:28.347 --> 00:37:30.263
OK, let’s go back to
the original question.

783
00:37:30.263 --> 00:37:32.638
Simon, you haven’t had
a chance to answer that yet.

784
00:37:32.638 --> 00:37:35.555
Is the new lockdown going to extend
beyond the 2nd of December?

785
00:37:35.555 --> 00:37:37.972
And he says this is
a pseudo—lockdown compared to March.

786
00:37:37.972 --> 00:37:38.972
Well, I hope not.

787
00:37:38.972 --> 00:37:41.138
If, you know...
I think we all hope not.

788
00:37:41.138 --> 00:37:43.763
Yes, well, I mean, particularly,
I have to say, you know,

789
00:37:43.763 --> 00:37:45.430
for the country’s economy’s
point of view.

790
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.347
I mean, nonessential retail
has been locked down,

791
00:37:47.347 --> 00:37:50.013
despite the fact that Sage said that
locking down nonessential retail

792
00:37:50.013 --> 00:37:54.680
would have minimal to low
impact, despite that —

793
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.597
and we’ll take that,
and we’ll lockdown, absolutely,

794
00:37:56.597 --> 00:37:58.763
and we’ll do it well.

795
00:37:58.763 --> 00:38:02.597
But if we don’t open in December,
and people can’t get

796
00:38:02.597 --> 00:38:05.013
to the shops in December,
and that business is either

797
00:38:05.013 --> 00:38:08.138
crammed into the last two
weeks before Christmas,

798
00:38:08.138 --> 00:38:11.263
which will create all the crowds
that we are trying to avoid, or,

799
00:38:11.263 --> 00:38:13.972
even worse, we don’t open
at all before Christmas,

800
00:38:13.972 --> 00:38:17.305
that will be a dagger in the heart
to lots and lots of retailers.

801
00:38:17.305 --> 00:38:20.222
I’m very fortunate to work
for a business that could make it

802
00:38:20.222 --> 00:38:23.097
all the way through to Christmas
and beyond with our shops closed,

803
00:38:23.097 --> 00:38:26.472
but many won’t, so I have to say,
for the sake of our economy,

804
00:38:26.472 --> 00:38:27.930
I think we have to open.

805
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.555
And I also think the Government do
have to look at what is high and low

806
00:38:32.555 --> 00:38:35.972
risk, and the idea that we’ve had
to shut all our shops, even though

807
00:38:35.972 --> 00:38:38.847
the Government pulls my own advisers
say that they are low risk

808
00:38:38.847 --> 00:38:41.722
environments does strike me as being
odd, but we’ll live with it.

809
00:38:41.722 --> 00:38:43.888
What I would just say
to the Government now,

810
00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:48.097
and I think this is desperately
important, and I think Ricky made

811
00:38:48.097 --> 00:38:50.013
this point indirectly,
is that we keep hearing

812
00:38:50.013 --> 00:38:53.180
about these silver bullets
that are coming along —

813
00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.097
the vaccines, the mass
testings, whatever it is.

814
00:38:55.097 --> 00:38:58.180
I think we have to plan
on the basis that it would be

815
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.888
lovely if it does happen,
but if it doesn’t we have

816
00:39:00.888 --> 00:39:03.013
to get our hospitals
ready for a third wave.

817
00:39:03.013 --> 00:39:04.472
The Prime Minister said last week,

818
00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:09.472
"Look, we can’t double
error capacity overnight.

819
00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:10.888
—— our capacity overnight.

820
00:39:10.888 --> 00:39:13.263
You know, we might run out
of oxygen and beds."

821
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:15.930
Well, in three months’ time,
if there is a third wave

822
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.013
in February, we have to be ready,
we have to have the beds,

823
00:39:19.013 --> 00:39:21.180
we have to have the oxygen,
the trained paramedics.

824
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.847
If we were fighting a war then
we wouldn’t say, "Look,

825
00:39:23.847 --> 00:39:25.972
we’re going to surrender now
because we haven’t got

826
00:39:25.972 --> 00:39:28.138
the hospital facilities to look
after the wounded troops."

827
00:39:28.138 --> 00:39:30.555
We just wouldn’t do that,
we would make it happen.

828
00:39:30.555 --> 00:39:32.722
And we’ve got to now
get serious about this.

829
00:39:32.722 --> 00:39:35.847
We’ve got to start saying that we
hope these things will come along,

830
00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:38.972
but if they don’t, then we will make
sure that our health service

831
00:39:38.972 --> 00:39:41.097
is ready to treat people,
has the best medicines,

832
00:39:41.097 --> 00:39:42.805
has enough equipment,
enough beds, enough staff.

833
00:39:42.805 --> 00:39:45.430
That’s what we’ve got to do over
the next three months,

834
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.055
because we can live with this
lockdown, but we can’t live

835
00:39:48.055 --> 00:39:49.263
with another one next year.

836
00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:51.180
We have to get out of the cycle.

837
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.263
Lisa?

838
00:39:53.263 --> 00:39:56.138
Whether we come out of lockdown
on December the 2nd I think

839
00:39:56.138 --> 00:39:58.555
is largely in the gift
of the Government and now.

840
00:39:58.555 --> 00:40:00.722
The reason that the Sage scientists
recommended a lockdown

841
00:40:00.722 --> 00:40:03.138
was because it gives us
the breathing space to fix

842
00:40:03.138 --> 00:40:05.263
test, trace and isolate.

843
00:40:05.263 --> 00:40:08.388
50, might I suggest to Oliver
that the first priority ought to be

844
00:40:08.388 --> 00:40:10.555
to take away contact tracing
from those very expensive

845
00:40:10.555 --> 00:40:14.222
private sector firms that
are clearly failing to do that?

846
00:40:14.222 --> 00:40:16.888
They are reaching just over half
of cases in the country,

847
00:40:16.888 --> 00:40:21.263
and handing that to local public
health directors, with

848
00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:23.847
the resources that they need
in order to do thatjob.

849
00:40:23.847 --> 00:40:26.222
They’re currently reaching almost
everybody that they try to trace

850
00:40:26.222 --> 00:40:27.930
because they have significant
expertise.

851
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:32.513
My own local authority
has brought in people

852
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:34.972
from the Missing Persons Unit,
in the police, they brought

853
00:40:34.972 --> 00:40:37.555
in people who work in sexual health
who are extremely skilled

854
00:40:37.555 --> 00:40:38.638
at doing this.

855
00:40:38.638 --> 00:40:40.972
The second thing is to get
a grip on communications.

856
00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:42.930
We can’t continue to
have a situation where,

857
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.805
you know, as we’ve heard,
people are extremely

858
00:40:44.805 --> 00:40:46.222
confused about the rules.

859
00:40:46.222 --> 00:40:49.138
And when you’ve got Cabinet
ministers out unable to answer

860
00:40:49.138 --> 00:40:52.097
the basic questions about rules that
have been published for which people

861
00:40:52.097 --> 00:40:54.972
can be fined or arrested,
when you got the Prime Minister that

862
00:40:54.972 --> 00:40:58.805
goes missing, we should be having
daily press conferences again.

863
00:40:58.805 --> 00:41:01.638
BorisJohnson must begin those press
conferences again and get a grip

864
00:41:01.638 --> 00:41:03.222
on the communication...

865
00:41:03.222 --> 00:41:05.888
Lisa, he did a press conference
at five o’clock this evening.

866
00:41:05.888 --> 00:41:06.888
I just watched it...

867
00:41:06.888 --> 00:41:10.013
He did, yeah, and where has he been
for the last few months?

868
00:41:10.013 --> 00:41:13.138
I mean, it really isn’t good enough,
and if you look at most

869
00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:16.013
of the countries in the world,
their leaders are out and helping

870
00:41:16.013 --> 00:41:18.680
people to understand notjust
what the rules are but why

871
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.555
they are being asked to follow them,
because if people understand then

872
00:41:21.555 --> 00:41:22.763
they tend to follow them.

873
00:41:22.763 --> 00:41:26.388
The final thing I would just say
is that that exchange

874
00:41:26.388 --> 00:41:30.472
about pregnancy and rights at work
was enormously frustrating,

875
00:41:30.472 --> 00:41:33.388
because the answer that you gave,
Oliver, is based on this idealised

876
00:41:33.388 --> 00:41:36.888
world in which people can
go to their employer,

877
00:41:36.888 --> 00:41:39.847
that nobody will be discriminated
against, that nobody

878
00:41:39.847 --> 00:41:42.222
will be put under pressure
to come into the office,

879
00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:44.638
and we know that that
just simply is not true,

880
00:41:44.638 --> 00:41:47.305
so the third thing that
I would suggest to you, urgently,

881
00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:50.388
is that people need the right,
help and support to follow the rules

882
00:41:50.388 --> 00:41:51.597
and stay safe.

883
00:41:51.597 --> 00:41:54.013
And that means we need support
for people to self—isolate,

884
00:41:54.013 --> 00:41:57.597
we need people to have proper rights
at work, and we also need to make

885
00:41:57.597 --> 00:42:01.763
sure that we get decisions right
like the furlough quickly.

886
00:42:01.763 --> 00:42:04.305
No government could have
foreseen this pandemic,

887
00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:07.472
and I’m enormously sympathetic
to the scale of the challenge that

888
00:42:07.472 --> 00:42:09.930
you and your colleagues have faced,
but any competent government

889
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.263
would have known that trying
to end the furlough scheme

890
00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:14.430
with a hard cliff edge
was going to be

891
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.472
absolutely disastrous.

892
00:42:17.472 --> 00:42:20.347
We are a real outlier around
the world in terms of that.

893
00:42:20.347 --> 00:42:23.263
And today the Chancellor announced,
finally, that he’s going to do it,

894
00:42:23.263 --> 00:42:25.388
but thousands of people had
needlessly lost their jobs

895
00:42:25.388 --> 00:42:28.513
in the middle of a global pandemic
because of the indecision and delay.

896
00:42:28.513 --> 00:42:30.930
So we have to get far
better at making these

897
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.972
decisions more quickly.

898
00:42:33.972 --> 00:42:36.638
I think Lisa makes a very important
point about people’s jobs

899
00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:38.972
and the furlough scheme,
and that is why, and it’s

900
00:42:38.972 --> 00:42:44.013
important for people watching
the show to understand,

901
00:42:44.847 --> 00:42:48.263
that if people were made redundant
at any point after the 23rd

902
00:42:48.263 --> 00:42:51.097
of September, they can go back
to their employers, get reemployed

903
00:42:51.097 --> 00:42:53.722
and claimed the furlough scheme,
and actually in the overall working

904
00:42:53.722 --> 00:42:56.347
of the scheme — take, for example,
the International Monetary Fund

905
00:42:56.347 --> 00:42:58.013
today said we were a world leader.

906
00:42:58.013 --> 00:43:00.180
We’ve put more resource
into supporting people through work

907
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.430
than virtually any other country...

908
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.263
France gave its citizens
two years, Germany gave

909
00:43:03.263 --> 00:43:04.347
its citizens two years...

910
00:43:04.347 --> 00:43:07.472
Let’s hear from the audience, just
for a minute, because in a sense

911
00:43:07.472 --> 00:43:09.097
you are the people affected by it.

912
00:43:09.097 --> 00:43:10.555
Ricky?

913
00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:13.805
Thanks again, Fiona.

914
00:43:13.805 --> 00:43:16.930
I’m really glad to hear Mr Dowden
talk about we can go back

915
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.805
to our employers and be rehired,
and I will be quoting him

916
00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:24.388
in my e—mail to my past
employers this evening.

917
00:43:24.388 --> 00:43:27.097
I’m self—employed, I’m
a theatre director.

918
00:43:27.097 --> 00:43:29.513
I also teach in drama schools
and universities and youth

919
00:43:29.513 --> 00:43:31.347
groups and such like.

920
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:34.888
But, like so many people in the arts
and in the cultural industries,

921
00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:38.513
we do otherjobs to pay the rent
in the gaps, and one of mine

922
00:43:38.513 --> 00:43:42.972
was in box office, selling
the tickets to other people’s shows.

923
00:43:42.972 --> 00:43:45.597
And we were very grateful
for the furlough during the summer,

924
00:43:45.597 --> 00:43:50.555
and of course it ended
and we were made redundant.

925
00:43:55.472 --> 00:43:57.347
And I’m really, really
glad for those people

926
00:43:57.347 --> 00:43:59.972
who still have a job
that the furlough has been extended,

927
00:43:59.972 --> 00:44:02.597
but it really came too
late for so many of us,

928
00:44:02.597 --> 00:44:05.513
and I am now risking losing my house
and the whole thing.

929
00:44:05.513 --> 00:44:08.680
It really, really has
destroyed so many people,

930
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.055
not only in the cultural industries,
I’m notjust talking

931
00:44:11.055 --> 00:44:15.305
about theatre.

932
00:44:15.305 --> 00:44:19.222
People across the country,
itjust is so disappointing,

933
00:44:19.222 --> 00:44:22.847
and I use that word to try and be
polite, but we are here today

934
00:44:22.847 --> 00:44:24.305
finding out it has been extended.

935
00:44:24.305 --> 00:44:25.972
This should have been
extended months ago.

936
00:44:25.972 --> 00:44:27.388
This thing is not going away.

937
00:44:27.388 --> 00:44:28.847
We need to support each other.

938
00:44:28.847 --> 00:44:31.472
We need to all be back
for the recovery as well.

939
00:44:31.472 --> 00:44:35.055
You know, we all need to be
there in a job and ready to go.

940
00:44:35.055 --> 00:44:37.722
And, Rose, just get us your
perspective from over the other

941
00:44:37.722 --> 00:44:38.805
side of the Atlantic.

942
00:44:38.805 --> 00:44:41.638
I mean, America has had its own
problems with how it’s handled

943
00:44:41.638 --> 00:44:44.388
the coronavirus pandemic.

944
00:44:44.388 --> 00:44:47.305
How does the UK look to be faring
from where you’re sitting?

945
00:44:47.305 --> 00:44:51.097
You know, I think what’s
really obvious to me

946
00:44:51.097 --> 00:44:56.138
from the other side of the pond,
as it were, is that politicians

947
00:44:57.597 --> 00:44:59.555
giving these hard dates
for lockdowns ending,

948
00:44:59.555 --> 00:45:00.972
you know, you’re fighting...

949
00:45:00.972 --> 00:45:04.180
You’re boxing with a ghost.

950
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.847
You know, Covid is a ghost and it’s
everywhere right now.

951
00:45:06.847 --> 00:45:09.972
And we don’t know where it is.

952
00:45:09.972 --> 00:45:12.388
And so when you get these hard
dates, December2nd,

953
00:45:12.388 --> 00:45:17.388
or things like that,
it’s completely logical to me.

954
00:45:20.888 --> 00:45:21.930
—— illogical to me.

955
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.555
And the furlough thing didn’t work
and so many people have

956
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:27.138
needlessly lost their jobs,
and it breaks my heart because I

957
00:45:27.138 --> 00:45:28.847
know what the UK is good at.

958
00:45:28.847 --> 00:45:31.222
You know, the UK, the public
has always been great

959
00:45:31.222 --> 00:45:32.305
at pulling together.

960
00:45:32.305 --> 00:45:35.638
Look at you in World War II,
look at you taking the tough hits

961
00:45:35.638 --> 00:45:36.680
for the greater good.

962
00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.972
But when they’re completely confused
about what the greater good is,

963
00:45:39.972 --> 00:45:43.805
and that’s because people are not
laying out the right measures

964
00:45:43.805 --> 00:45:47.930
and they are not, you know,
serving their people with some kind

965
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.013
of measures of safety,
and notjust testing.

966
00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:55.055
You know, with financial safety.

967
00:45:55.222 --> 00:45:58.347
You’re ending up where you are,
and I don’t think there can be

968
00:45:58.347 --> 00:46:01.472
a hard deadline to end things,
but there has to be a very

969
00:46:01.472 --> 00:46:03.180
intelligent alternative,
and to include businesses

970
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.805
in that as well.

971
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:08.430
I know if you make things
clear the public will do

972
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.597
their damnedest to keep it going.

973
00:46:11.597 --> 00:46:14.722
But they have to know what’s up,
and doubletalk right now from any

974
00:46:14.722 --> 00:46:16.138
government is not cutting it.

975
00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:19.180
Rose, I love the fact that your dog
isjoining in behind you.

976
00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.097
That’s just a great
slice of real life.

977
00:46:21.097 --> 00:46:22.722
We love to see that.

978
00:46:22.722 --> 00:46:24.097
And very cute it is, too.

979
00:46:24.097 --> 00:46:25.263
David?

980
00:46:25.263 --> 00:46:26.847
Pearl!

981
00:46:26.847 --> 00:46:30.347
Thank you, Fiona.

982
00:46:30.347 --> 00:46:35.347
I’d be really keen to know
what the panel think of the lessons

983
00:46:35.722 --> 00:46:39.097
learned from coming out of the first
lockdown because, you know,

984
00:46:39.097 --> 00:46:44.097
we’ve got a real opportunity
here to review some of the mistakes

985
00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.805
that perhaps were made
last time with a view

986
00:46:46.805 --> 00:46:49.472
to avoiding them this time,
so, you know, where we overzealous

987
00:46:49.472 --> 00:46:53.222
in getting people back
into restaurants and pubs?

988
00:46:53.222 --> 00:46:55.930
Did we encourage people back
to the workplace too soon?

989
00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.805
Were the travel corridors that
were opened appropriate?

990
00:46:57.805 --> 00:47:02.805
And so on.

991
00:47:05.513 --> 00:47:08.305
Well, listen, we could go
all round you all, but I’m keen

992
00:47:08.305 --> 00:47:10.972
to get one more question,
so let me just hear briefly

993
00:47:10.972 --> 00:47:12.138
from you, Hannah, on that.

994
00:47:12.138 --> 00:47:13.180
OK, so...

995
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.638
I mean, yes to all of the above,
essentially, David.

996
00:47:15.638 --> 00:47:16.680
I think.

997
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.097
It depends what strategy you want.

998
00:47:18.097 --> 00:47:20.513
There are some countries
in the world that have opted

999
00:47:20.513 --> 00:47:21.555
for a zero—Covid, right?

1000
00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:24.180
So zero tolerance of Covid cases,
and in that case travel

1001
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.305
corridors are a no—no
until you establish a bubble

1002
00:47:26.305 --> 00:47:28.472
with another country
that is in a similar situation.

1003
00:47:28.472 --> 00:47:30.930
I think the best comparison,
you know, for us, really,

1004
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:35.888
is the other countries around Europe
who sort of kept travel open.

1005
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.347
You know, similar size,
similar economies and so on.

1006
00:47:42.347 --> 00:47:44.805
And I think the real lessons
from Europe have been...

1007
00:47:44.805 --> 00:47:47.180
This is like a runaway train
that is accelerating, right?

1008
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.347
And the earlier and harder
you press the brake,

1009
00:47:49.347 --> 00:47:51.763
the quicker you bring things
to a halt, and that’s

1010
00:47:51.763 --> 00:47:53.680
really what we learned,
I think, from Germany.

1011
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.847
I think the other big lesson
from Germany, actually,

1012
00:47:55.847 --> 00:47:58.222
was about really tapping into that
sort of collective spirit.

1013
00:47:58.222 --> 00:48:00.888
Angela Merkel, when she made
decisions, she made sure she had

1014
00:48:00.888 --> 00:48:03.513
all of the local leaders with her,
and they presented it

1015
00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:06.138
as a united front.

1016
00:48:06.138 --> 00:48:09.472
And I think that that really,
for me, is the big, big lesson here.

1017
00:48:09.472 --> 00:48:11.388
We had so much goodwill
in this country.

1018
00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:13.972
You know, an epidemic of altruism
we had in the spring.

1019
00:48:13.972 --> 00:48:16.930
And I think that’s really
what we should be trying to tap

1020
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.055
into now rather than squander.

1021
00:48:18.055 --> 00:48:21.513
Let’s get one more question in,
from Rebecca Falconer.

1022
00:48:21.513 --> 00:48:24.138
Yesterday, the Bank of England
projected that UK GDP is set

1023
00:48:24.138 --> 00:48:27.513
to shrink by 11% by the end of 2020,
one of the worst performances

1024
00:48:27.513 --> 00:48:28.555
in the entire world.

1025
00:48:28.555 --> 00:48:33.555
Does the panel think the UK can
afford a no—deal Brexit with the EU?

1026
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.388
Well, Simon is the
businessman on the panel.

1027
00:48:39.388 --> 00:48:43.763
What do you think?

1028
00:48:43.763 --> 00:48:46.138
I think a no—deal Brexit pales
into insignificance when compared

1029
00:48:46.138 --> 00:48:48.555
to what we’ve just been through.

1030
00:48:48.555 --> 00:48:48.972
to what we’ve just been through.

1031
00:48:48.972 --> 00:48:52.055
I think the important thing,
and I hope we do have a deal,

1032
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:54.972
let’s just say that,
but if we don’t have a deal it

1033
00:48:54.972 --> 00:48:56.638
really isn’t the end of the world.

1034
00:48:56.638 --> 00:48:59.763
really isn’t the end of the world.

1035
00:48:59.763 --> 00:49:03.763
Businesses now had three years
to prepare for this.

1036
00:49:03.763 --> 00:49:06.847
There is one thing that is going
to be important and will make

1037
00:49:06.847 --> 00:49:09.222
the difference between weather
no—deal Brexit has a huge effect

1038
00:49:09.222 --> 00:49:12.097
on our economy or very little,
and that is whether our ports

1039
00:49:12.097 --> 00:49:14.180
continue to operate well.

1040
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.972
If our ports continue to function
well, and all the administration

1041
00:49:17.972 --> 00:49:21.555
is in place to keep them going,
then I don’t think we have a great

1042
00:49:21.555 --> 00:49:23.263
deal to fear from a no—deal Brexit.

1043
00:49:23.263 --> 00:49:25.388
And, from talking to your
colleagues, do you feel

1044
00:49:25.388 --> 00:49:26.430
businesses are ready?

1045
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.847
I can only speak for the business
that I work for, and we’ve been

1046
00:49:29.847 --> 00:49:34.805
preparing for years for this.

1047
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:38.013
We were ready over a year ago,
so I think people have been

1048
00:49:38.013 --> 00:49:39.097
working incredibly hard.

1049
00:49:39.097 --> 00:49:41.722
And I should say, you know,
the company I work for,

1050
00:49:41.722 --> 00:49:43.638
we export and import virtually
everything we sell,

1051
00:49:43.638 --> 00:49:44.888
in one way or another.

1052
00:49:44.888 --> 00:49:47.472
It’s either come from another
country or sent to another country.

1053
00:49:47.472 --> 00:49:49.180
As long as the ports keep working.

1054
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.097
And tariffs — you’re not
worried about tariffs

1055
00:49:51.097 --> 00:49:52.513
in the event of an ordeal?

1056
00:49:52.513 --> 00:49:55.388
I would rather not have tariffs,
and I think there’s an enormous

1057
00:49:55.388 --> 00:49:58.805
opportunity here for the Government.

1058
00:49:58.805 --> 00:50:01.222
At the moment, the Government’s
stance is "We willjust

1059
00:50:01.222 --> 00:50:04.305
raise tariffs on all European goods
to the same level that we have

1060
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:08.805
on the rest of the world",
and the rhetoric from the Government

1061
00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.555
is "We want a free—trading
in Britain".

1062
00:50:10.555 --> 00:50:13.930
If we come out of the European
Union, if we don’t have a deal,

1063
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:15.638
we’ve got a free trade in Britain.

1064
00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:16.805
Why not lower those tariffs?

1065
00:50:16.805 --> 00:50:17.888
Why does Britain...

1066
00:50:17.888 --> 00:50:20.722
Why are we going to persist
with tariffs on goods that come

1067
00:50:20.722 --> 00:50:23.347
from other countries where we have
no domestic production at all?

1068
00:50:23.347 --> 00:50:26.513
Clothing, over 99% of the clothing
we wear comes from outside the UK.

1069
00:50:26.513 --> 00:50:27.972
Why have tariffs on those goods?

1070
00:50:27.972 --> 00:50:30.555
Don’t make the consumer pay
the price of a no—deal Brexit.

1071
00:50:30.555 --> 00:50:33.680
What the Government should do is,
if in the unlikely and, you know,

1072
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.555
hopefully it won’t happen,
in the event that there is no deal,

1073
00:50:36.555 --> 00:50:39.180
but lower tariffs on goods
that we have no production of.

1074
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.430
Don’t make the consumer pay.

1075
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.055
Lisa?

1076
00:50:42.055 --> 00:50:47.013
I think a no—deal Brexit would be
an enormous failure,

1077
00:50:50.305 --> 00:50:55.347
and I think it would be an utter
betrayal of the British people,

1078
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.513
given that we had a Prime Minister
who won an 80 seat majority only

1079
00:51:01.513 --> 00:51:03.680
last December by promising us this
oven—ready Brexit deal.

1080
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.305
All the way through this debate,
the Government has recognised that

1081
00:51:06.305 --> 00:51:08.680
a deal is perfectly possible,
it ought to be possible,

1082
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.847
and it would be in the interests
of the country to get one.

1083
00:51:11.847 --> 00:51:14.388
So I think it would be areal
failure of negotiation

1084
00:51:14.388 --> 00:51:17.013
if the Government wasn’t able
to present us with a deal

1085
00:51:17.013 --> 00:51:18.472
at the end of the year.

1086
00:51:18.472 --> 00:51:19.513
Would Labour...

1087
00:51:19.513 --> 00:51:21.430
And what I would say to Simon is...

1088
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:23.847
With Labour lower tariffs on goods
that we don’t produce?

1089
00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:24.972
We would negotiate a deal.

1090
00:51:24.972 --> 00:51:27.138
I mean, we simply wouldn’t
be in the situation.

1091
00:51:27.138 --> 00:51:29.305
Understood, but in the event
there was no deal...

1092
00:51:29.305 --> 00:51:31.472
And, actually, the Government
doesn’t need to put us

1093
00:51:31.472 --> 00:51:33.888
in the situation either,
because with a bit of goodwill

1094
00:51:33.888 --> 00:51:37.222
on both sides we could see a deal
by the end of the year.

1095
00:51:37.222 --> 00:51:38.263
Come on, answer...

1096
00:51:38.263 --> 00:51:40.888
What I would say to you,
though, is that it’s very,

1097
00:51:40.888 --> 00:51:43.222
very different running a company
like Next — or Heinz

1098
00:51:43.222 --> 00:51:45.680
in my constituency —
a major employer with huge amounts

1099
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.222
of money and the ability to plan,
compared to the small

1100
00:51:48.222 --> 00:51:49.972
and medium—sized businesses
in my constituency, especially

1101
00:51:49.972 --> 00:51:51.888
those who deal in things
like perishable goods,

1102
00:51:51.888 --> 00:51:54.972
because they will be the ones that
start to go under a very,

1103
00:51:54.972 --> 00:51:57.847
start to go under very,

1104
00:51:57.847 --> 00:52:00.972
very quickly if we have the chaos
at the ports and we have

1105
00:52:00.972 --> 00:52:03.597
all of the barriers and tariffs that
you were talking about.

1106
00:52:03.597 --> 00:52:06.388
And you’ve got to recognise that
for a lot of these businesses

1107
00:52:06.388 --> 00:52:08.305
there hasn’t been clarity,
there hasn’t been certainty.

1108
00:52:08.305 --> 00:52:11.222
They were told to get ready
for Brexit quite some time ago

1109
00:52:11.222 --> 00:52:12.388
and then it didn’t happen.

1110
00:52:12.388 --> 00:52:15.263
This has been a long period
of uncertainty, and when you add

1111
00:52:15.263 --> 00:52:17.597
into that the uncertainty around
Covid you’re creating a perfect

1112
00:52:17.597 --> 00:52:19.763
storm for many businesses
with the potential for mass

1113
00:52:19.763 --> 00:52:20.847
unemployment as a consequence.

1114
00:52:20.847 --> 00:52:24.638
What I would say to Oliver as well
is that there will be some parts

1115
00:52:24.638 --> 00:52:27.680
of the country that are much worse
affected than others in the event

1116
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.097
of a no—deal Brexit,
and the Prime Minister made two

1117
00:52:30.097 --> 00:52:33.888
promises in that election.

1118
00:52:33.888 --> 00:52:37.680
He made a promise to get us a Brexit
deal, and he made a promise

1119
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.013
to level—up parts of the country,
including my own constituency

1120
00:52:40.013 --> 00:52:42.680
in Wigan, that has seen relative
economic decline for A0 years.

1121
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.305
If the consequence of this
is a Conservative Party that has

1122
00:52:45.305 --> 00:52:47.930
failed to negotiate a deal,
and because of that has seen

1123
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.305
a levelling down of those very parts
of the country that just turned blue

1124
00:52:51.305 --> 00:52:53.638
at the last election,
that will be an enormous failure,

1125
00:52:53.638 --> 00:52:57.305
and I don’t think it
will be forgotten.

1126
00:52:57.305 --> 00:53:01.555
Well, look, I just want to say
I’m hopeful that we can

1127
00:53:01.555 --> 00:53:03.472
still get a future trading
relationship with Europe.

1128
00:53:03.472 --> 00:53:07.763
We will either go to
an Australia—style WHO terms,

1129
00:53:07.763 --> 00:53:09.138
or we’ll get the Canada deal...

1130
00:53:09.138 --> 00:53:10.222
Which is no deal.

1131
00:53:10.222 --> 00:53:15.180
Well, it’s. ..

1132
00:53:15.597 --> 00:53:18.430
Australia, Somalia, Ethiopia, call
it what you like, but it’s no deal.

1133
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:23.472
The key thing is it cannot be a deal
at any price, and what I worry

1134
00:53:24.388 --> 00:53:26.847
about from what Lisa
is saying, if we say, "Oh,

1135
00:53:26.847 --> 00:53:29.722
we’ve just got to get
a deal", then we end up surrendering

1136
00:53:29.722 --> 00:53:30.722
national interests here.

1137
00:53:30.722 --> 00:53:32.638
But people voted to leave
the European Union.

1138
00:53:32.638 --> 00:53:33.680
I was a Remainer...

1139
00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.847
We should be able
to get a good deal.

1140
00:53:35.847 --> 00:53:37.763
I accept the British
people voted to leave.

1141
00:53:37.763 --> 00:53:40.888
I mean, we were told this would be
the easiest deal in history.

1142
00:53:40.888 --> 00:53:43.972
There are opportunities from leaving
the European Union but we have to be

1143
00:53:43.972 --> 00:53:46.347
able to realise those through having
a Canada—style deal where

1144
00:53:46.347 --> 00:53:47.805
we can set our own rules.

1145
00:53:47.805 --> 00:53:50.347
If you take an area that I’m
responsible for, for example,

1146
00:53:50.347 --> 00:53:52.055
the digital economy,
there are huge opportunities

1147
00:53:52.055 --> 00:53:54.222
for trading, huge opportunities
with ﬂows of data with

1148
00:53:54.222 --> 00:53:55.930
the United States,
with China, with India.

1149
00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.222
We have to have the freedom to be
able to set our own policies,

1150
00:53:59.222 --> 00:54:02.055
and if we can do that we can seize
the brighter opportunity.

1151
00:54:02.055 --> 00:54:05.972
We can’tjust take a deal at any
cost, and Ifear that the Labour

1152
00:54:05.972 --> 00:54:09.555
policy of simply signalling
that we just want a deal would mean

1153
00:54:09.555 --> 00:54:10.972
that we won’t get the opportunity...

1154
00:54:10.972 --> 00:54:13.138
You said you would deliver
an oven—ready Brexit deal,

1155
00:54:13.138 --> 00:54:15.055
but you forgot to turn the oven on.

1156
00:54:15.055 --> 00:54:17.472
And here we are, a year
later, and you’ve made

1157
00:54:17.472 --> 00:54:18.513
precisely zero progress.

1158
00:54:18.513 --> 00:54:20.388
It’s great rhetoric, Lisa,
but actually we left

1159
00:54:20.388 --> 00:54:22.305
the European Union, we entered
the transition period,

1160
00:54:22.305 --> 00:54:23.763
we had a dealfor that.

1161
00:54:23.763 --> 00:54:25.930
What we’re talking about now
is our future trading

1162
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.680
relationship...

1163
00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.013
And you haven’t made any progress
on those key objectives.

1164
00:54:32.013 --> 00:54:34.722
the best way to get a future
trading relationship in the

1165
00:54:34.722 --> 00:54:37.097
interests of the UK
is to be willing to say,

1166
00:54:37.097 --> 00:54:39.013
"We won’t have a
deal at any cost".

1167
00:54:39.013 --> 00:54:41.888
I still believe we can get that
deal, but we have to

1168
00:54:41.888 --> 00:54:44.972
hang firm and make it clear
that we will get the right deal.

1169
00:54:44.972 --> 00:54:47.138
I’m so bored and exasperated
with all of this!

1170
00:54:47.138 --> 00:54:49.305
Are you trying to say
this debate is boring?

1171
00:54:49.305 --> 00:54:50.305
LAUGHTER

1172
00:54:50.305 --> 00:54:55.305
No, I’m sorry.

1173
00:54:57.472 --> 00:55:00.930
I’m a bit of an outsider
on this one, I accept,

1174
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.847
but itjust seems to me,
broadly speaking,

1175
00:55:02.847 --> 00:55:04.763
everyone seems happy
that is going to happen,

1176
00:55:04.763 --> 00:55:06.180
it’s not going to happen yet.

1177
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.305
We just have to wait
until it’s less politically

1178
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:11.722
embarrassing to concede to the EU
than it is to admit that you haven’t

1179
00:55:11.722 --> 00:55:12.763
got a deal.

1180
00:55:12.763 --> 00:55:15.597
I mean, that’s sort of, like,
how it looks from the outside

1181
00:55:15.597 --> 00:55:16.638
and Ijust...

1182
00:55:16.638 --> 00:55:17.680
It’s very frustrating.

1183
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.597
It’s frustrating that
everyone is in this period

1184
00:55:19.597 --> 00:55:20.763
of uncertainty while that happens.

1185
00:55:20.763 --> 00:55:23.638
And, Rose, of course, we are waiting
for the US election results.

1186
00:55:23.638 --> 00:55:26.972
There is a lot of talk about,
if Biden wins, and at the moment

1187
00:55:26.972 --> 00:55:30.805
he’s looking on track like he may
well do that, that the UK may not be

1188
00:55:30.805 --> 00:55:33.722
exactly top of the diplomacy trade
priority list if we haven’t got

1189
00:55:33.722 --> 00:55:34.888
a deal with the EU.

1190
00:55:34.888 --> 00:55:36.263
How does it look to you?

1191
00:55:36.263 --> 00:55:39.347
It looks still like a lot
of posturing and still like a lot

1192
00:55:39.347 --> 00:55:44.347
of empty promises, and still like,
you know, just get it done.

1193
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.555
If this is what you’re going to do
then you should’ve had this done.

1194
00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:56.180
You should have turned on the oven,
you should have checked

1195
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.055
on your food, on your baked goods,
and be ready to bring

1196
00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.263
it out of the oven.

1197
00:56:00.263 --> 00:56:03.180
Because if Simon at Next can do it
then surely the Government

1198
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.305
can figure it out too.

1199
00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:06.972
All this oven talk is actually
making me feel really hungry,

1200
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:07.972
actually.

1201
00:56:07.972 --> 00:56:09.013
I’m hungry!

1202
00:56:09.013 --> 00:56:10.263
We all getting hungry now.

1203
00:56:10.263 --> 00:56:11.263
Gabriel?

1204
00:56:11.263 --> 00:56:14.388
What I was going to ask is,
now that we are looking at

1205
00:56:14.388 --> 00:56:16.305
Brexit in conjunction
with lockdown, can the UK

1206
00:56:16.305 --> 00:56:17.722
afford to not have a deal?

1207
00:56:17.722 --> 00:56:20.097
Well, that’s a central question,
that’s what we are dealing

1208
00:56:20.097 --> 00:56:21.180
with here, isn’t it?

1209
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.847
Alex, you had your hand up too.

1210
00:56:22.847 --> 00:56:25.263
I was just going to comment
on the financial services

1211
00:56:25.263 --> 00:56:27.430
industry, which is actually
the industry I work in.

1212
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.472
If we leave without a deal,
there is going to be

1213
00:56:30.472 --> 00:56:35.388
no access to financial services
to European markets, which is a huge

1214
00:56:36.972 --> 00:56:40.555
blow for a lot of firms that
were out of the US into the UK,

1215
00:56:40.555 --> 00:56:42.222
and that doesn’t seem
to be recognised.

1216
00:56:42.222 --> 00:56:45.347
I know it’s not a popular industry,
but it is worth billions and

1217
00:56:45.347 --> 00:56:47.055
billions and billions
to the UK economy.

1218
00:56:47.055 --> 00:56:49.680
So how does the Government proposed
to address that lack of

1219
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.138
access if there is no deal?

1220
00:56:51.138 --> 00:56:52.138
David?

1221
00:56:52.138 --> 00:56:55.597
Thanks, Fiona.

1222
00:56:55.597 --> 00:57:00.638
I agree with the Secretary
of State’s comment that no deal

1223
00:57:01.263 --> 00:57:04.347
is better than a bad deal,
in effect, but what I’m not clear

1224
00:57:04.347 --> 00:57:09.388
on is what the argument is for not
trying to negotiate a short

1225
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.513
extension to the exit negotiations,
given the international crisis

1226
00:57:11.513 --> 00:57:16.555
we are going through.

1227
00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:25.055
So why not get an extension,
given that we are in

1228
00:57:25.055 --> 00:57:26.222
the middle of a pandemic?

1229
00:57:26.222 --> 00:57:28.388
And what about Alex’s point
about the financial services?

1230
00:57:28.388 --> 00:57:30.555
Well, I think, to the point
about an extension,

1231
00:57:30.555 --> 00:57:32.013
it goes to your point, Hannah.

1232
00:57:32.013 --> 00:57:35.097
People are fed up with Brexit —
they voted to get this thing

1233
00:57:35.097 --> 00:57:36.180
done in 2016.

1234
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.555
We are now almost in 2021.

1235
00:57:37.555 --> 00:57:39.763
We just have to deliver.

1236
00:57:39.763 --> 00:57:42.180
Alex is absolutely right
about the value of our financial

1237
00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:47.013
services, and of course we continue
to negotiate with Europe.

1238
00:57:47.013 --> 00:57:50.055
It’s also worth noting
that the London financial service

1239
00:57:50.055 --> 00:57:52.222
industry and financial services up
and down the country

1240
00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:54.805
are tremendously innovative,
and I am confident that they will be

1241
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.222
able to adapt to
those circumstances.

1242
00:57:56.222 --> 00:57:58.138
We have been a world
leader for centuries

1243
00:57:58.138 --> 00:58:00.972
because of the huge skills we have,
whether it’s at the law

1244
00:58:00.972 --> 00:58:02.013
firms, the accountancy firms.

1245
00:58:02.013 --> 00:58:04.222
All of them come together,
and I’m confident they

1246
00:58:04.222 --> 00:58:05.388
will be able to adapt.

1247
00:58:05.388 --> 00:58:07.555
50, Alex, are you confident
you’re going to adapt?

1248
00:58:07.555 --> 00:58:08.805
You are in this industry.

1249
00:58:08.805 --> 00:58:13.805
I think it’s very difficult.

1250
00:58:13.888 --> 00:58:16.763
I mean, there are some financial
services firms that will be fine

1251
00:58:16.763 --> 00:58:18.930
because they don’t rely on Europe
for their income,

1252
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:23.888
but there are others.

1253
00:58:24.347 --> 00:58:27.430
Like I say, I am familiar with quite
a few firms, for example,

1254
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:29.305
that come over from the States,
establish themselves

1255
00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:31.972
in the UK to access Europe,
and then when we leave

1256
00:58:31.972 --> 00:58:34.138
they will leave, and so
we are losing billions

1257
00:58:34.138 --> 00:58:36.055
of pounds to Germany,
to Holland, and European

1258
00:58:36.055 --> 00:58:38.680
bases are being set up
in places other than the UK,

1259
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.055
which is not only money
going off their shores, but

1260
00:58:41.055 --> 00:58:42.138
alsojobs.

1261
00:58:42.138 --> 00:58:45.472
And I don’t see how in the next
month and a half the Government

1262
00:58:45.472 --> 00:58:47.888
are going to get a comprehensive
deal on financial services.

1263
00:58:47.888 --> 00:58:50.305
You know, we’ve been watching
this for years, and it

1264
00:58:50.305 --> 00:58:53.097
doesn’t seem to have progressed
at all, to be honest with you.

1265
00:58:53.097 --> 00:58:55.513
Well, I think we could discuss
this for some time.

1266
00:58:55.513 --> 00:58:58.888
We could put you on the spot again,
Oliver, but our time is up,

1267
00:58:58.888 --> 00:59:00.347
you might be glad to know.

1268
00:59:00.347 --> 00:59:02.013
So tonight our questions
came from Lewisham.

1269
00:59:02.013 --> 00:59:04.680
Next week we’ll be joined
by our variance audience in Dover,

1270
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.347
and the week after that in Windsor.

1271
00:59:06.347 --> 00:59:08.930
So if you want to be part
of our virtual audience,

1272
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:09.597
do get in touch on the Question Time
website, and let’s hear

1273
00:59:09.597 --> 00:59:11.847
do get in touch on the Question Time
website, and let’s hear

1274
00:59:11.847 --> 00:59:12.430
what you’ve got to say.

1275
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.972
what you’ve got to say.

1276
00:59:12.972 --> 00:59:15.138
Adrian Chiles and guests
are coming up, as always,

1277
00:59:15.138 --> 00:59:16.388
on Question Time Extra Time.

1278
00:59:16.388 --> 00:59:20.222
That’s on 5 Live now, and you can
see on the screen how to get in

1279
00:59:20.222 --> 00:59:20.930
touch and put your points there.

1280
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.680
touch and put your points there.

1281
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.972
But I just want to
say, for now, thank

1282
00:59:25.972 --> 00:59:28.305
you very much to our panel
for coming into that.

1283
00:59:28.305 --> 00:59:31.222
And thank you very much to Jan,
who we met earlier on

1284
00:59:31.222 --> 00:59:32.638
at the top of the programme.

1285
00:59:32.638 --> 00:59:34.805
And thank you very
much to Rose, and I

1286
00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:36.972
must say, given that
you broke your wrist yesterday,

1287
00:59:36.972 --> 00:59:39.388
and you are doing this programme
especially for us, we

1288
00:59:39.388 --> 00:59:42.722
are very grateful — what a trooper.
So thank you very much to you.

1289
00:59:42.722 --> 00:59:44.388
Thank you to the
audience in Lewisham,

1290
00:59:44.388 --> 00:59:46.097
thank you very much forjoining us.

1291
00:59:46.097 --> 00:59:48.722
And of course thank
you to you at home for watching.

1292
00:59:48.722 --> 00:59:49.805
From Question Time, goodbye.

1293
00:59:49.805 --> 00:59:54.763
APPLAUSE

1294
01:00:06.888 --> 01:00:09.638
I’ve come to realise, as a grandson
of a Holocaust survivor,

1295
01:00:09.638 --> 01:00:12.805
that our stories bear witness
to some painful truths.

1296
01:00:12.805 --> 01:00:17.013
But they’re also full of light,
of truth and of resilience.

1297
01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.097
Thank you for being with me today.

1298
01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:30.930
This season,
the FA Cup is different.

1299
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:33.805
No draws, only winners and losers.

1300
01:00:33.805 --> 01:00:36.597
Every game is final,
and penalties await.

1301
01:00:36.597 --> 01:00:39.097
If you’re not up for it, you’re out.

1302
01:00:39.097 --> 01:00:40.763
The FA Cup: zero filler.

1303
01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:44.180
Starts with FC United of Manchester
v Doncaster Rovers.

1304
01:00:48.638 --> 01:00:53.097
# I will try to fix you... #

1305
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.972
THEY CHEER

1306
01:00:56.972 --> 01:00:59.305
Oh, my goodness!

1307
01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:02.055
You’re a magician! You are amazing!

1308
01:01:28.972 --> 01:01:32.847
There is a bit of a slide war
going on, war by PowerPoint,

1309
01:01:32.847 --> 01:01:34.305
at the top of government.

1310
01:01:34.305 --> 01:01:35.305
A chart—off.

1311
01:01:35.305 --> 01:01:39.138
A chart—off, yes!

1312
01:01:39.138 --> 01:01:42.972
So, basically, on Saturday,
we had Chris being watched

1313
01:01:42.972 --> 01:01:45.138
by M million people,
and Whitty and Vallance

1314
01:01:45.138 --> 01:01:50.138
showing these slides that
you just couldn’t read,

1315
01:01:50.388 --> 01:01:52.972
and then, Chris, today the UK
Statistics Authority kind of giving

1316
01:01:52.972 --> 01:01:55.638
them a bit of a smack
on the wrists, didn’t they?

1317
01:01:55.638 --> 01:01:56.680
They did, yeah.

1318
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.888
16 million, by the way.

1319
01:01:57.888 --> 01:02:00.013
Just to give you a
smack on the wrist!

1320
01:02:00.013 --> 01:02:01.722
Sorry!
I should have been more accurate.

1321
01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:02.763
Yeah, I know.

1322
01:02:02.763 --> 01:02:04.930
I was just saving you
a rebuke next week.

1323
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.847
So, yeah, they did, and then there’s
that broader point, isn’t there,

1324
01:02:07.847 --> 01:02:10.180
which is when you have those "Next
slide, please" moments,

1325
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.597
and somebody off—screen
clicking the clicker,

1326
01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:13.847
you’rejust left, aren’t
you, as a viewer, just

1327
01:02:13.847 --> 01:02:14.847
overwhelmed, really?

1328
01:02:14.847 --> 01:02:17.222
Particularly when you get those kind
of colour scheme ones,

1329
01:02:17.222 --> 01:02:19.138
like you would get in a paint shop.

1330
01:02:19.138 --> 01:02:21.555
When actually, you know,
the old mantra, less is more,

1331
01:02:21.555 --> 01:02:23.805
you know, they might be
onto something with that.

1332
01:02:23.805 --> 01:02:27.472
Then Simon Stevens,
the chief exec of the NHS,

1333
01:02:27.472 --> 01:02:30.305
swoops in and does his own smack
down at the Downing Street

1334
01:02:30.305 --> 01:02:31.347
press C0 nfe re nce .

1335
01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.388
Smack down!

1336
01:02:32.388 --> 01:02:34.555
Like you, and I’m sure
that the Prime Minister

1337
01:02:34.555 --> 01:02:36.763
won’t mind me saying so,
I’ve watched a number

1338
01:02:36.763 --> 01:02:40.555
of these press briefings,
and sometimes the charts can be

1339
01:02:40.555 --> 01:02:43.930
a bit hard to keep up with,
so I’ve just got one chart today

1340
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:46.055
that indisputably sets out
what we in the health

1341
01:02:46.055 --> 01:02:47.930
service are seeing.

1342
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:51.347
And if we can have that,
that one chart, please?

1343
01:02:51.347 --> 01:02:54.222
What it shows is the number
of patients that are being looked

1344
01:02:54.222 --> 01:02:56.347
after in hospitals across England.

1345
01:02:56.347 --> 01:02:58.013
Vicki, you were doing
the press conference.

1346
01:02:58.013 --> 01:03:00.763
Did the sass just
emanate off the screen?

1347
01:03:00.763 --> 01:03:03.638
Well, it was funny because Boris
Johnson was laughing when he talked

1348
01:03:03.638 --> 01:03:05.513
about how the slides
were all quite confusing.

1349
01:03:05.513 --> 01:03:07.680
But then quite a lot
of people have quite

1350
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.180
liked Chris Whitty’s
"Next slide, please".

1351
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.347
It doesn’t work if it’s
just one, does it?

1352
01:03:11.347 --> 01:03:12.972
I mean, you don’t
have that excitement.

1353
01:03:12.972 --> 01:03:14.930
Although Simon Stevens
broke his own rule then,

1354
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:15.930
by showing another slide.

1355
01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:17.388
Yes, it was all very confusing.

1356
01:03:17.388 --> 01:03:19.805
When you’re sitting there doing
the press conference on Zoom,

1357
01:03:19.805 --> 01:03:21.430
I can’t even see the slides anyway.

1358
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.347
So, I didn’t know what was going on.

1359
01:03:23.347 --> 01:03:25.805
Having said he had won,
he then seemed to be

1360
01:03:25.805 --> 01:03:26.972
talking about quite a few.

1361
01:03:26.972 --> 01:03:29.347
And we’ve all watched hundreds
of hours of American TV,

1362
01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.513
so we are absolute experts
on TV graphics now.

1363
01:03:31.513 --> 01:03:33.972
And we will discuss what those
graphics mean, whether it’s

1364
01:03:33.972 --> 01:03:36.263
the American election or coronavirus
in the UK, on this

1365
01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:37.930
edition of Newscast.

1366
01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:43.513
Hello.

1367
01:03:43.513 --> 01:03:44.888
It’s Adam in the studio.

1368
01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:47.930
And Vicki also in the studio.

1369
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:51.513
And Chris in my socially distant
booth, down the corridor.

1370
01:03:51.513 --> 01:03:54.722
And we are going to talk
about the introduction

1371
01:03:54.722 --> 01:03:57.555
of the English lockdown in a bit,
and we’ll also talk quite

1372
01:03:57.555 --> 01:03:59.722
a lot about the return
of the furlough scheme,

1373
01:03:59.722 --> 01:04:02.013
which Rishi Sunak announced today.

1374
01:04:02.013 --> 01:04:04.388
That’s quite a big deal
in terms of the Government’s

1375
01:04:04.388 --> 01:04:08.888
handling of the pandemic.

1376
01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:11.430
And we’re also going to talk loads
about the American election.

1377
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.763
And we have managed...

1378
01:04:12.763 --> 01:04:14.430
Last week, we spoke
to George Osborne.

1379
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.763
We’ve got somebody who’s spent a lot
of time arguing with him...

1380
01:04:17.763 --> 01:04:21.055
Ed Balls, former Shadow
Chancellor, and Strictly

1381
01:04:21.055 --> 01:04:23.430
contestant, and Harvard University
fellow, and bit of an American

1382
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.055
politics geek — am I right?

1383
01:04:26.055 --> 01:04:28.513
And maker of programmes
about Donald Trump for the BBC.

1384
01:04:28.513 --> 01:04:30.138
Indeed.

1385
01:04:30.138 --> 01:04:33.222
And we’re going to see some
of the best bits of that documentary

1386
01:04:33.222 --> 01:04:35.180
you’ve made in a minute.

1387
01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.597
Now, I hope somebody,
if you are listening to this

1388
01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:39.972
or watching it on iPlayer
in the future, you know

1389
01:04:39.972 --> 01:04:44.972
the result of the American
presidential election,

1390
01:04:45.805 --> 01:04:47.513
because we here now
are still waiting.

1391
01:04:47.513 --> 01:04:50.597
And, Chris, it seems to me
that the story is Biden is closing

1392
01:04:50.597 --> 01:04:55.597
in on the 270 electoral college
votes, Trump is challenging

1393
01:04:56.597 --> 01:04:59.430
in as many states as he can,
but we’re still basically waiting

1394
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:02.555
for some of the key ones to just
declare, and then this bit

1395
01:05:02.555 --> 01:05:03.972
of the process will be over?

1396
01:05:03.972 --> 01:05:06.430
Yeah, and Ijust keep bumping
into people who look

1397
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:08.847
absolutely rough as anything,
because they didn’t get any sleep

1398
01:05:08.847 --> 01:05:11.680
whatsoever over the past 48 hours,
and they are beginning to wonder

1399
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.138
whether it was worthwhile, given
we are still in the "Mm" territory.

1400
01:05:15.138 --> 01:05:18.055
But it was all very exciting
and lots of American anchors getting
