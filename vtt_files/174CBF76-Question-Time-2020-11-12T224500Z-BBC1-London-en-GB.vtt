lots of blustery showers pushing
into the north—west of the UK.

20
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.005
into the north-west of the UK.
Tomorrow,

Tomorrow, we’ll have rain first

22
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.339
Tomorrow, we’ll have rain first
thing which should clear through

23
00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.464
thing which should dear through
then

24
00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.547
thing which should clear through
then another bright day with

25
00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:34.880
then another bright day with
sunshine and showers. We have the

26
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.422
sunshine and showers. We have the
hand of heavy,

27
00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:36.172
sunshine and showers. We have the
band of heavy, squally rain across

28
00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.589
band of heavy, squally rain across
the central parts of the country.

29

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.880
Northern Ireland and western
Scotland, some could be thundery. It

35
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.797
Scotland, some could be thundery. It
will be windy, 40—50 miles an hour

a strong further south. Despite the

40
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.255
a strong further south. Despite the
sunshine it’s going to be on the

41
00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:58.297
sunshine it’s going to be on the
chilly side,

42
00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:00.505
sunshine it’s going to be on the
chilly side,10—13. Into the

43
00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:00.672
chilly side, 10-13 . Into the
weekend,

44
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:01.547
chilly side,10—13. Into the
weekend, low pressure

45
00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:02.214
chilly side, 10—13. Into the
weekend, low pressure dominates the

46
00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:05.839
weekend, low pressure dominates the
scene, both Saturday and Sunday. A

47
00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:07.255
scene, both Saturday and Sunday. A
squeeze in across southern parts of

48
00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:08.214
squeeze in across southern parts of
Britain especially on Sunday and

49
00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:09.130
Britain especially on Sunday and
lots of weather fronts indicating

50
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.589
lots of weather fronts indicating
spells of rain. And lots of weather

51
00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:11.964
spells of rain. And lots of weather
fronts indicating spells of rain. An

52
00:01:11.964 --> 00:01:12.339
fronts indicating spells of rain. An
unsettled weekend.

53
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.839
I’m not good at relationships,

54
00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:16.464
so I would love to just...

55
00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:17.797
..fix that.

56
00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:21.380
Something really bad just happened.
What? Darby?

57
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.255
Iran into Augie. BOTH: No!
Yeah! He’s in New York,

58
00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:26.255
which I would know
if I hadn’t unfollowed him.

59
00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:27.547
And he has a new girlfriend!

60
00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:28.630
Eww.

61
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.672
There are good things happening
in my life.

62
00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:35.839
You are playing the long game.
You keep your eyes on the prize.

63
00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:38.630
When you talk about love, you turn
into Coach Taylor. Really sweet.

64
00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:46.922
A demonstration took place
against the police...

65
00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:51.839
..which degenerated into totally
inexcusable violence.

66
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.464
This is a sustained campaign...

67
00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:57.839
Hands off!

68
00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:59.380
..against black people...

69
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.297
Hands off! Hands off!

70
00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:04.839
..and today we will say
enough is enough!

71
00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:06.172
Hands off!

72
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.255
Welcome to Question Time.

73

before being appointed
Health Secretary just over two

76
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:53.089
years ago, a post he held
onto when BorisJohnson

77
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.255
became party leader.

to find a vaccine for
coronavirus, Robin Shattock.

84
00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:14.380
Joining us down the line,
Merryn Somerset Webb,

85
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.797
a finance and economics commentator,
journalist and editor in chief

86

87
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:25.589
as The Last Leg and Eight Out
of Ten Cats, Rosiejones.

88
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.839
Good evening, welcome
to my guest here in the studio.

89
00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.422
Merryn, welcome to you, joining us
down the line from Edinburgh,

90
00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:39.589
very good to see you,
and our live audience

91
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:40.630
is with us again.

92
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.547
Very good to see you via video link.

93
00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:47.589
Tonight you’rejoining us
from Dover, thank you very

94
00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:48.755
much for doing that.

95
00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:51.380
And for those of you joining
us from home, dojoin

96
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.005
in the conversation on social media,
@bbcquestiontime and the usual way.

97
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:57.589
And before we get going, Ijust
want to say we are going to do

98
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:59.297
things a bit differently
to begin with.

99
00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:04.255
We have had a lot of questions
about the vaccine that we all hope

100
00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:07.339
is going to get us out of this
situation, so we are going

101
00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.047
to do quite a number of questions
quite quickly to you,

102
00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:13.130
Matt, and then of course,
for the rest of you on the panel,

103
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.255
if you want to pitch in,
please do, and of course you there,

104
00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:19.130
please do, and of course you,

105
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.172
the audience in Dover.

106
00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:23.089
There is going to be a lot
of questions coming your way

107
00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.255
to begin with before we move
onto other topics.

108
00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:29.464
So, let’s have ourfirst
question from Mark Reynolds.

109
00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:31.505
So, my question is,

110
00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.922
how many people need
to have the vaccine before it

111
00:04:33.922 --> 00:04:34.922
would be successful?

112
00:04:34.922 --> 00:04:37.839
Now we have heard that there
is going to be some vaccines

113
00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:40.922
possibly before the end of the year,
but it is going to be

114
00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:42.172
significantly less than we need.

115
00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:45.005
How many people need to be
vaccinated for it to be successful?

116
00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:47.380
Yes, what percentage of
the population are we talking about?

117
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.547
Well, the honest truth to that
question is that we don’t yet know.

118
00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:53.172
It is one of the many
things that we don’t yet

119
00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:55.839
know about the vaccine,
and the reason for that is that

120
00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:00.505
in the trials that the vaccines
undergo, you test for how effective

121
00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:03.214
they are protecting the individual,
and also of course how safe

122
00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:06.089
they are, and if they are safe
and effective then we can

123
00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.130
start to roll them out.

124
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.964
And the early date from the Pfizer
vaccine shows that it looks

125
00:05:11.964 --> 00:05:16.214
like it is 90% effective
at protecting individuals,

126
00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:20.214
so that is great, so as soon,
or if it passes the safety data,

127
00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:24.464
and, you know, that is a big hurdle
that it still has not gone over,

128
00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:27.339
then we can start rolling it out
and it starts protecting people

129
00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.339
as soon as they have had it,
a week or so after the second dose.

130
00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:36.714
But what you do not know
at the moment is whether it needs

131
00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:39.339
to be 50% of the population or 70%
of the population,

132
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.922
you are still not there.

133
00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:43.297
Because the evidence
from the trial is how much it

134
00:05:43.297 --> 00:05:47.172
protects an individual,
and you can only find out,

135
00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:51.964
once a lot of people have taken it,
what the direct impact

136
00:05:51.964 --> 00:05:53.880
is on stopping the spread
of the disease.

137
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.505
Because this particular vaccine,
Robert, we don’t know if it stops

138
00:05:56.505 --> 00:05:59.172
people catching coronavirus,
but we do know that it stops them,

139
00:05:59.172 --> 00:06:04.172
or stops 90% of them,
getting sick from it.

140
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.630
Yes.

141
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.755
It is really early.

142
00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.630
We know that it prevents
people developing disease,

143
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.047
for a period of time that it
has been studied.

144
00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:20.672
We don’t know whether it
will protect people for six months,

145
00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.839
12 months, and we have no
information right now

146
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.005
as to whether it will prevent
transmission, so that

147
00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:30.005
means its first priority is actually
to use it to protect

148
00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:31.589
vulnerable populations.

149
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.880
We have a question exactly
on that from John.

150
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.755
Can the government confirm that
if and when the vaccine is approved,

151
00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:42.755
it will be distributed strictly
based upon clinical needs?

152
00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:53.047
Yes.

153
00:06:53.047 --> 00:06:54.297
That is our proposal.

154
00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:57.422
We have a committee that is made up
of clinicians and experts that

155
00:06:57.422 --> 00:07:01.755
advises me, as Health Secretary,
in my formal capacity,

156
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:06.714
theJoint Committee on Vaccinations
and Immunisations, and this group

157
00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:11.172
looks at the data from a vaccine,
and they have been working closely

158
00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:14.255
with Pfizer and AstroZeneca
on the two early vaccines,

159
00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:19.255
and it works out what is the best
clinical way of protecting most

160
00:07:20.297 --> 00:07:23.255
people, and they have put out
an interim recommendation,

161
00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:27.422
which is that first we should
vaccinate people who are resident

162
00:07:27.422 --> 00:07:30.547
in care homes and the people
who work looking after them,

163
00:07:30.547 --> 00:07:35.547
and then health and social
care workers and then,

164
00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:41.505
essentially down the age range,
because for all the different

165
00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:46.464
things, like obesity,
that we know has an impact

166
00:07:46.464 --> 00:07:49.630
on your vulnerability to disease,
we know that your age is the single

167
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.464
biggest factor by a long stretch,
and so, the answer, very simple

168
00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:54.630
answer to your question, yes,
we will vaccinate according

169
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.297
to clinical priority,
because that is how

170
00:07:56.297 --> 00:08:01.297
we save the most lives.

171
00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:06.255
John, is this of particular
concern for you?

172
00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:08.172
Is that why you have
asked the question?

173
00:08:08.172 --> 00:08:11.047
No, I have asked the question
because I am obviously the oldest

174
00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:12.964
person here this evening
on the virtual panel,

175
00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:17.964
probably in the whole audience,
but obviously I would be one

176
00:08:21.922 --> 00:08:26.964
of those down the line to be
affected, not in the first tranche,

177
00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:31.922
but certainly I am well over 70 now,
so I would be fairly close to that.

178
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.755
I personally, I have heard of quite
a few people who are scared

179
00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:39.922
of having the vaccine,
but I personally would not

180
00:08:39.922 --> 00:08:42.547
even hesitate having it,
because I know a lot of people

181
00:08:42.547 --> 00:08:44.964
who are very scared
at the moment, simple as that.

182
00:08:44.964 --> 00:08:47.589
And, Rosie, is it clear
to you what someone in your

183
00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:49.214
situation might get the vaccine?

184
00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:53.047
No, not really.

185
00:08:53.047 --> 00:08:58.047
I know you have mentioned care
workers and what about people

186
00:08:58.422 --> 00:09:02.005
who still need to work,
what about teachers,

187
00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:07.047
what about people who
work in supermarkets?

188
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.880
Where in the line do they come?

189
00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:23.964
Yes, so the clinical priority
is all about protecting people

190
00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:30.214
according to essentially their risk
from the virus, and so after we have

191
00:09:30.214 --> 00:09:34.297
gone down to the over 655,
according to the proposal

192
00:09:34.297 --> 00:09:37.630
on the data that we have seen,
and they may update it

193
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.464
as we see more information,
then you go to those

194
00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:45.505
who are particularly vulnerable
from all age groups,

195
00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:50.005
and then after that
down to the over 505.

196
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:55.047
Once you get below the over 50s,
there is less of a clinical

197
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.505
justification for any particular...

198
00:09:59.505 --> 00:10:04.547
What do you mean,
below the over 505?

199
00:10:07.047 --> 00:10:09.714
Well, the people who don’t
have an illness which makes them

200
00:10:09.714 --> 00:10:11.630
particularly vulnerable
to coronavirus, who are

201
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.589
aged between 18 and 50,
they are the least likely to die

202
00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:25.005
from coronavirus, and so
the clinicians who have advised me

203
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:34.130
on this expert panel say
that they come after all

204
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.339
the people who are either

205
00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:38.422
older or work in health and social
care or who have a particular

206
00:10:38.422 --> 00:10:40.339
vulnerability, and unfortunately
we know quite a lot

207
00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:43.505
about who is vulnerable to Covid
because of having looked at who has

208
00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:45.880
been badly affected over
the last nine months or so.

209
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.880
The head of the Vaccine Task Force
says that she was anticipating only

210
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.630
5096 of the population would ever
get a vaccine.

211
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.297
This was before the Pfizer
announcement was made, so is that

212
00:10:55.297 --> 00:10:56.339
your anticipation as well?

213
00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:58.755
It sounds like it is,
from what you are saying?

214
00:10:58.755 --> 00:11:02.422
No, not necessarily.

215
00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:05.630
We have learned more and more
about the vaccine as time has gone

216
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.255
on and the latest advice
is that we should go in the order

217
00:11:09.255 --> 00:11:11.630
that I have described
and then to the under 505,

218
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.797
but not to children,
because this vaccine has not

219
00:11:13.797 --> 00:11:16.214
been tested on children,
it is not designed for children

220
00:11:16.214 --> 00:11:21.214
and anyway children are very,
very unlikely to get

221
00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:27.464
ill from coronavirus.

222
00:11:27.464 --> 00:11:31.047
I think two things, one,
you didn’t mention Britain’s black,

223
00:11:31.047 --> 00:11:34.297
Asian and minority ethnic
population, which we know

224
00:11:34.297 --> 00:11:38.964
are disproportionately
dying as a consequence,

225
00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.380
and I hope that they
are part of the group.

226
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.047
There are other front line workers,
other than care home workers

227
00:11:44.047 --> 00:11:46.630
There are other front line workers,
other than care home workers

228
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.797
and nurses, and we can’t have one
way, the head of the Vaccine

229
00:11:49.797 --> 00:11:51.964
Task Force saying 50%
and then one week later,

230
00:11:51.964 --> 00:11:53.880
the Secretary of State
for Health saying, no.

231
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.464
Is it less than 50%
or is it more than 50%?

232
00:11:56.464 --> 00:11:59.380
Well, we will get to, I hope,
should a vaccine come off,

233
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.714
and of course it is still uncertain,
we will get to more than 50%,

234
00:12:02.714 --> 00:12:05.880
and that is because we have learned
more about the details of both

235
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.880
the virus and the vaccine.

236
00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:15.964
In a week?

237
00:12:15.964 --> 00:12:18.547
No, the comments that you referred
to were some time ago.

238
00:12:18.547 --> 00:12:21.255
And the expert body who advises us
has published its interim

239
00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:26.214
recommendations a few weeks ago,
and then it will publish the final

240
00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:32.089
recommendations when we get
the final data about the vaccine,

241
00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:37.505
about any vaccine, it should it be
both effective and safe,

242
00:12:37.505 --> 00:12:39.630
and those are the two absolutely
critical things

243
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.172
that we will look at.

244
00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:44.297
And if people can pay for it,
will they get it more quickly?

245
00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:46.922
Well, I don’t think that
that is going to be possible.

246
00:12:46.922 --> 00:12:49.589
Well, I don’t think that
that is going to be possible.

247
00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:52.464
So does that mean that
the government is going to buy up

248
00:12:52.464 --> 00:12:56.089
all the doses, and so people
will not be able to go to a private

249
00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:58.714
doctor or what have you and say,
"I would like that"?

250
00:12:58.714 --> 00:13:02.089
It may not be in this particular
phase, or they may not be eligible

251
00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:04.255
for the government guidelines,
but "I can buy it,

252
00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:05.672
so therefore I can have it?"

253
00:13:05.672 --> 00:13:08.089
I don’t foresee that,
because it has been hard enough

254
00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:09.714
buying this as a government...

255
00:13:09.714 --> 00:13:12.339
As those who have developed
the vaccine have done and have

256
00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:14.505
been with governments,
so we have bought, on behalf

257
00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:16.880
of the whole UK population,
and we intend to roll—out,

258
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.005
according to clinical priority.

259
00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:22.464
Let us take another
question from Joe Craft.

260
00:13:22.464 --> 00:13:26.172
Yes, good evening.

261
00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:30.922
Is the storage and distribution
infrastructure in place to guarantee

262
00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:32.964
the viability of the vaccine?

263
00:13:32.964 --> 00:13:35.339
This is complicated,
isn’t it, because you need

264
00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:38.839
these super freezers,
that keep it at —70 degrees.

265
00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:41.422
Yes.

266
00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:43.589
The Scottish Government, I know,
has already bought some

267
00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:44.672
of these super freezers.

268
00:13:44.672 --> 00:13:45.714
Yes.

269
00:13:45.714 --> 00:13:48.130
Are you going to be
able to pull this off?

270
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.172
Yes.

271
00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:50.339
You sound very, very confident.

272
00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:53.005
I remember you coming
in here and saying that about PPE,

273
00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:55.172
in the very early stage
of the first wave.

274
00:13:55.172 --> 00:13:58.005
So, come on!

275
00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.339
On PPE, I remember sitting in this
chair and explaining

276
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:01.380
how difficult it was...

277
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.505
Yes, but you also said
that we will have it sorted at that

278
00:14:04.505 --> 00:14:05.547
time by the weekend.

279
00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:07.714
And we got there.

280
00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:12.047
But on this, the NHS is in charge
of distributing it and we are...

281
00:14:12.047 --> 00:14:17.047
The UK Government is buying this
vaccine and the other back

282
00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:23.339
The UK Government is buying this
vaccine and the other vaccines

283
00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:25.255
and it is important
we have a portfolio,

284
00:14:25.255 --> 00:14:28.172
that we have several
and we are buying them for the whole

285
00:14:28.172 --> 00:14:30.755
UK, and then the NHS in each
country, in England, Scotland

286
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:33.214
and Wales and Northern Ireland
is responsible for the deployment.

287
00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:37.172
It is a challenge,
it is incredibly difficult.

288
00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:41.922
In fact, I would add one
more challenge, Joe,

289
00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:45.964
you talked about the distribution
and the storage, there is one

290
00:14:45.964 --> 00:14:49.130
other really hard part,
which is the manufacture,

291
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.922
which in the case of this vaccine
that Pfizer are doing, but these

292
00:14:53.922 --> 00:14:55.172
things are hard to manufacture.

293
00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:56.214
You know...

294
00:14:56.214 --> 00:14:57.630
You are not responsible for that.

295
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.755
What you are responsible for is
making sure that people can get it.

296
00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:04.214
I will come onto that,
but you have got to think,

297
00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:07.255
they are hard to do the science,
they are then hard to manufacture,

298
00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:09.672
this thing, it is not
a chemical that is made,

299
00:15:09.672 --> 00:15:14.380
this is biological.

300
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.380
Then it arrives and you have to keep
it at —70, and we have come out,

301
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:26.339
the NHS, we have known for some
time, so the NHS has been getting

302
00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:29.464
hold of the serious deep freezers
and then you have to distribute it

303
00:15:29.464 --> 00:15:31.839
and it will be a huge
effort from the NHS.

304
00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:34.255
They are supported by the armed
services in doing that.

305
00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:39.214
Now, thankfully, the NHS is a very
significant organisation that has

306
00:15:39.214 --> 00:15:42.297
reaches into all parts
of the country.

307
00:15:42.297 --> 00:15:45.422
So, the reason I answered,
when you said, are you ready to do

308
00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:49.255
it, it is something we are working
on every day, it will be

309
00:15:49.255 --> 00:15:53.422
complicated, it will be a huge
challenge, but I am sure

310
00:15:53.422 --> 00:15:58.380
that the NHS is up to it.

311
00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:02.089
I mean, I think we need to recognise
there has been enormous

312
00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:04.464
excitement about this vaccine,
because it is the first evidence

313
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.547
that it is a vaccine
preventable disease,

314
00:16:06.547 --> 00:16:09.422
but that does not mean that it
will be the only vaccine,

315
00:16:09.422 --> 00:16:12.839
and I think what is encouraging is,
if we also believe the news

316
00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:17.464
that is coming out of Russia,
we will see a series of vaccines

317
00:16:17.464 --> 00:16:22.464
coming through, which may have
different advantages for deployment.

318
00:16:23.422 --> 00:16:26.755
So, right now, we have to act
as if this is the only vaccine

319
00:16:26.755 --> 00:16:29.630
that is going to work,
but we could have a very different

320
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.589
conversation in two,
three or four weeks’ time,

321
00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:33.964
and I think it returns to this
issue of prioritisation,

322
00:16:33.964 --> 00:16:37.089
it is a difficult vaccine to get
out, there are about 10 million

323
00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:41.714
vulnerable population,
and if you started vaccinating

324
00:16:41.714 --> 00:16:45.130
inJanuary, given that it takes 5—6
weeks to get immunity,

325
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:50.172
and you did 1 million people a week,
we would not get that 10 million

326
00:16:50.297 --> 00:16:52.922
vaccinated until way into April,
and that is assuming that everyone

327
00:16:52.922 --> 00:16:55.589
comes in for their first shot
and for their second shot

328
00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:57.964
and you are not playing catch up,
so the logistical

329
00:16:57.964 --> 00:17:03.172
problem is immense.

330
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.297
That does not mean that people
should be off the hook,

331
00:17:06.297 --> 00:17:09.464
but it is to understand that
challenge, and that is why we need

332
00:17:09.464 --> 00:17:14.047
to prioritise the way
the vaccine is rolled out.

333
00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:15.464
Ellie.

334
00:17:15.464 --> 00:17:17.672
Hi, good evening.

335
00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:21.047
So, are we aware at all of what sort
of other countries are doing

336
00:17:21.047 --> 00:17:22.255
in regards to the vaccine?

337
00:17:22.255 --> 00:17:24.880
Is there much liaison going on with
the World Health Organization,

338
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.089
because obviously China
was the first affected,

339
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.672
and how far have they advanced
in terms of coming along

340
00:17:30.672 --> 00:17:31.714
with a vaccine?

341
00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:34.172
Is there much, you know,
communication there?

342
00:17:34.172 --> 00:17:37.297
Let me get a few questions
and we will put them to Matt

343
00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:38.714
and possibly to David as well.

344
00:17:38.714 --> 00:17:41.005
Marie.

345
00:17:41.005 --> 00:17:45.214
Hi, I was just wondering
whether the government could foresee

346
00:17:45.214 --> 00:17:50.172
any potential supply issues
after Brexit at the end of the year

347
00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:52.672
and whether that would coordinate
any transportation issues

348
00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:55.297
with the vaccine coming into the UK?

349
00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:58.214
Well, I think we might come
to that point in a moment,

350
00:17:58.214 --> 00:18:01.714
so I am going to park it,
but it has obviously been

351
00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:06.755
one of the big issues.

352
00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:10.255
Eamon.

353
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.130
Yes, I guess it is more
of a statement than a question,

354
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.547
but I think that Matt is really
underestimating the massive

355
00:18:15.547 --> 00:18:19.005
challenges that we are going to have
with the supply and distribution

356
00:18:19.005 --> 00:18:23.714
of this product, because I have seen
first hand with the flu

357
00:18:23.714 --> 00:18:27.589
vaccination campaign,
this flu season, we have had massive

358
00:18:27.589 --> 00:18:32.630
issues with pharmacies
running out of stock,

359
00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:36.089
using up their stock quite
quickly and not been able

360
00:18:36.089 --> 00:18:41.130
to replenish that stock.

361
00:18:44.464 --> 00:18:47.380
GP surgeries being out of stock
for having to wait for more

362
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:52.339
than a month to get new stock in,
and the flu vaccine

363
00:18:56.214 --> 00:19:01.255
is something that is much,
much more straightforward,

364
00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:13.130
Amy, you are saying that
as a pharmacist, it is worth just

365
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.255
repeating the words ofJohn Vale
from Oxford University

366
00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:18.214
who predicted, with some confidence,
he said that life could be back

367
00:19:18.214 --> 00:19:20.130
to normal by spring,
with the big caveat,

368
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.047
provided they do not screw
up the distribution.

369
00:19:22.047 --> 00:19:24.880
Ijust want to respond to Eamon’s
point, because I totally agree

370
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.505
with him, and as a pharmacist,
you will have seen this,

371
00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:29.964
the question I was asked
was, can we do it?

372
00:19:29.964 --> 00:19:32.130
And my answer to
that is, yes, we can.

373
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.255
Well, the question was,
is the storage and distribution

374
00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:35.714
infrastructure in place
to guarantee it?

375
00:19:35.714 --> 00:19:37.589
Is this going to be
an enormous challenge?

376
00:19:37.589 --> 00:19:38.672
Of course!

377
00:19:38.672 --> 00:19:41.297
This will be one of the biggest
civilian operations in history,

378
00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:43.922
and I think it will have
all the challenges that Eamon

379
00:19:43.922 --> 00:19:46.839
set out, but I think
that the NHS can rise to them,

380
00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:49.422
and I think that we can
come together and we can

381
00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:50.464
help make it happen.

382
00:19:50.464 --> 00:19:54.130
So, I am confident that we can make
it happen, and I am also highly

383
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.964
confident that it is going to be
extremely difficult,

384
00:19:56.964 --> 00:20:00.130
and also one of the biggest
logistical exercises that this

385
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.672
country has ever seen,
and you are right, there have been

386
00:20:02.672 --> 00:20:07.630
huge challenges in so many parts
of the response to this coronavirus,

387
00:20:08.714 --> 00:20:13.505
huge challenges, and we have learnt
a huge amount all the way through,

388
00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:18.297
and it hasn’t been easy, but,
you know, we have got

389
00:20:18.297 --> 00:20:23.130
through so many of those challanges
in the past.

390
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.422
I am sorry, Matt, but it is just
a bit facile when you say

391
00:20:26.422 --> 00:20:28.839
things like, yes, we can.

392
00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:31.672
The point is that we have heard
there have been problemsjust

393
00:20:31.672 --> 00:20:34.589
getting out the flu vaccine this
year, and we have still got

394
00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:37.005
to do more, obviously,
because flu runs with us right

395
00:20:37.005 --> 00:20:40.214
into the spring, we know that
you blew 500 million

396
00:20:40.214 --> 00:20:44.714
on PPE that did not work.

397
00:20:44.714 --> 00:20:47.380
We know that it is now
nine months and 12 days

398
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.505
since the first infection in York,
and we still, in the sixth richest

399
00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:54.505
economy in the world,
have not got a successful Test,

400
00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:58.089
Track and Trace system,
and so, in the end, this

401
00:20:58.089 --> 00:21:00.630
is about public confidence.

402
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.005
We need people to believe
and to take the vaccine,

403
00:21:03.005 --> 00:21:06.672
but I think you are being asked,
can you do it, given that these

404
00:21:06.672 --> 00:21:11.380
freezers are, you know, —70,
are necessary to get this

405
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.422
distributed, and you can understand
why people are slightly nervous

406
00:21:14.422 --> 00:21:17.464
that we are going to be well
into the summer before this vaccine

407
00:21:17.464 --> 00:21:20.880
is properly rolled out.

408
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.839
All I would say is that it is not
can I do it, can we do it?

409
00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:27.339
Right?

410
00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:29.964
This is something that we,
as a nation, need to do,

411
00:21:29.964 --> 00:21:31.880
together with the NHS obviously
in the late...

412
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.505
Well, hang on a minute,
that is all very well...

413
00:21:34.505 --> 00:21:36.839
No, no, no, everybody coming
forward to be vaccinated,

414
00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:40.380
everybody participating,
in the same way that

415
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.464
with social distancing,
that is something we all need to do

416
00:21:43.464 --> 00:21:48.422
and, yes, absolutely,
this is doable.

417
00:21:49.672 --> 00:21:52.797
I am not saying it is easy
and I am not saying it

418
00:21:52.797 --> 00:21:55.672
will be straightforward,
I am just saying, we have got to do

419
00:21:55.672 --> 00:22:00.589
it and we will get it done.

420
00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:05.380
I think it is very easy to say,
it is all of us, no,

421
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.380
it is up to you and the government
to lead us and to give us

422
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:19.130
the answers that we are not getting.

423
00:22:22.922 --> 00:22:27.922
As a member of the country that
I love, I am worried

424
00:22:30.005 --> 00:22:35.005
and scared because I am not
getting any answers.

425
00:22:41.005 --> 00:22:45.714
Ask the questions and we will
try to answer them.

426
00:22:45.714 --> 00:22:48.714
One of the challenges
of the pandemic is there

427
00:22:48.714 --> 00:22:53.714
are all sorts of questions that
everybody wants an answer to.

428
00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:56.297
All right, well, let us take some
more from our audience.

429
00:22:56.297 --> 00:22:57.839
Donna.

430
00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:59.339
Thank you.

431
00:22:59.339 --> 00:23:03.922
A recent survey found that around
one in six British people

432
00:23:03.922 --> 00:23:05.630
were unlikely to agree
to being vaccinated

433
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.422
against coronavirus.

434
00:23:09.422 --> 00:23:12.130
What, in your opinion,
in the opinion of the panel,

435
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.172
is the best way to reassure
the public that the new Covid—19

436
00:23:20.714 --> 00:23:22.380
vaccine will be both
effective and safe?

437
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.505
Before you answer that, Matt,
can Ijust see if there is anyone

438
00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:28.464
in our audience who is hesitating
about taking the vaccine?

439
00:23:28.464 --> 00:23:31.672
Who is not that sure about it?

440
00:23:31.672 --> 00:23:33.047
Who have we got here?

441
00:23:33.047 --> 00:23:34.464
Kay.

442
00:23:34.464 --> 00:23:36.297
Yeah, Matt, hi.

443
00:23:36.297 --> 00:23:39.505
I am concerned, because I do not
believe there has been adequate

444
00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:42.797
time to put the vaccine
through the rigorous testing

445
00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:45.589
that we would expect it to go
through before being given

446
00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:47.297
to the general public.

447
00:23:47.297 --> 00:23:52.339
What do you say or not?

448
00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:55.755
And Ellie?

449
00:23:55.755 --> 00:23:58.380
I would agree with Kay,
especially when you look at previous

450
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.547
things like thalidomide and things
like that, you know,

451
00:24:00.547 --> 00:24:03.422
are we really fully aware of,
you know, the side effects that

452
00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:06.505
could come along with the vaccine?

453
00:24:06.505 --> 00:24:11.464
Jay, I know you had some reticence
about taking the vaccine as well.

454
00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:15.755
Yeah, I have got to say,
I do agree with Matt completely,

455
00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:18.130
because we are in an unknown
pandemic at the minute,

456
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.464
so there are going to be a lot
of unknowns coming up for us,

457
00:24:21.464 --> 00:24:23.964
so I think staying positive,
looking to the future.

458
00:24:23.964 --> 00:24:26.297
I mean, during the start
of the pandemic, we had

459
00:24:26.297 --> 00:24:29.255
all those volunteers,
apply for helping out.

460
00:24:29.255 --> 00:24:32.755
If that can happen again, who knows
what can happen, I suppose?

461
00:24:32.755 --> 00:24:37.797
Would you be happy to
take the vaccine, Jay?

462
00:24:39.005 --> 00:24:41.547
I am probably one of the cautious
people, to be fair.

463
00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:46.589
I would rather wait and see
what the effect is, first of all.

464
00:24:47.297 --> 00:24:48.922
Imean...

465
00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:52.464
So at the moment, you are not sure?

466
00:24:52.464 --> 00:24:55.630
And, Merryn, you wanted in.

467
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.089
Yeah.

468
00:24:58.089 --> 00:25:00.672
I just wanted to say
that there is a big trust

469
00:25:00.672 --> 00:25:02.630
issue around vaccines,
and looking at the different

470
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.547
surveys, you can see,
depending on the surveys,

471
00:25:04.547 --> 00:25:07.172
between seven and 25% of people
will say that they are

472
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:11.172
generally quite suspicious
of a new vaccine like this.

473
00:25:11.172 --> 00:25:14.505
So there does need to be some kind
of campaign around the safety

474
00:25:14.505 --> 00:25:17.714
and the reminding everybody
of the accuracy of the vaccines

475
00:25:17.714 --> 00:25:20.672
that we have had over the last
couple of hundred years.

476
00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:25.630
It is really important to remember
that back in the 18005, you know,

477
00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:35.339
20 or 30% of kids died
before they were five,

478
00:25:35.339 --> 00:25:37.464
and we have put in place a vaccine
programme

479
00:25:37.464 --> 00:25:39.422
since that one, and
a couple of hundred,

480
00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:42.505
but around this idea of trust,
there is probably a very simple way

481
00:25:42.505 --> 00:25:45.214
to make the general population
believe in the vaccine and trust

482
00:25:45.214 --> 00:25:47.797
in the vaccine and perhaps,
at the same time, to increase

483
00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:50.714
a little trust in our politicians,
which obviously has fallen off quite

484
00:25:50.714 --> 00:25:53.339
substantially over the last nine
months, and that, I would suggest,

485
00:25:53.339 --> 00:25:56.714
that Matt, you have the vaccine
first and then every other MP has it

486
00:25:56.714 --> 00:25:59.547
and then we can roll it
out to a couple of top

487
00:25:59.547 --> 00:26:02.214
civil servants as well,
so once you have all had it,

488
00:26:02.214 --> 00:26:05.130
there is an element of trust
and that, we wait two weeks,

489
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.255
everything is fine, then
you can start rolling it

490
00:26:07.255 --> 00:26:08.255
out to everybody else.

491
00:26:08.255 --> 00:26:10.922
So, you want to wait and see
basically if Matt does

492
00:26:10.922 --> 00:26:13.089
not drop to the floor,
frothing at the mouth,

493
00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:15.005
kind of thing, before
you take it, Merryn?

494
00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:18.255
That would reassure the population
that it is absolutely fine.

495
00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:21.422
Well, I would take the vaccine
as soon as I am allowed to.

496
00:26:21.422 --> 00:26:26.380
But what about taking it just
to kind of encourage others?

497
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.464
I would be happy to do that,
the problem is that we’ll be

498
00:26:29.464 --> 00:26:34.089
putting me ahead of the queue
in terms of clinical need.

499
00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:39.047
Now, because I work
in the Department of Health,

500
00:26:39.797 --> 00:26:43.047
I can’t, as it happens,
as a health care worker,

501
00:26:43.047 --> 00:26:46.505
so if my taking it, when health care
workers are allowed to take it,

502
00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:49.130
so notjumping the queue,
if that would persuade a single

503
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:54.005
other person to take it and give
confidence to others,

504
00:26:54.005 --> 00:26:56.714
then I would be absolutely happy to.

505
00:26:56.714 --> 00:26:59.172
Shall we do a totally
unscientific straw poll?

506
00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:02.505
Put your hand up in the audience
if you think Matt should be one

507
00:27:02.505 --> 00:27:04.339
of the first to take it.

508
00:27:06.172 --> 00:27:11.172
Quite a lot, but not unanimity.

509
00:27:14.172 --> 00:27:15.839
Daniel is nodding his
head there vigorously.

510
00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:19.005
Robin, I know, because I have spoken
to some of our audience members

511
00:27:19.005 --> 00:27:21.547
already, before we came on,
that quite a few of them

512
00:27:21.547 --> 00:27:22.839
are very happy to take

513
00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:26.172
the vaccine as soon as they can get
it, and we have already heard

514
00:27:26.172 --> 00:27:27.297
from John to that effect.

515
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:29.714
Some people are a little bit
more worried about it.

516
00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:32.172
I think it is a really important
point, and actually,

517
00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:35.255
Jay’s position, to say "I am
going to wait and see what happens"

518
00:27:35.255 --> 00:27:36.505
is probably a common response.

519
00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:38.630
I think we need to remember
that actually vaccines,

520
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.797
next to clean water,
have been the single most

521
00:27:40.797 --> 00:27:45.797
effective public health
implementation globally.

522
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.089
They have saved more lives
than any other medicine,

523
00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:52.130
and the people are concerned
about this vaccine because they

524
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.255
perceive that it has
been done too quickly,

525
00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:55.630
and actually we have done

526
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.172
a disservice in saying that it takes
ten years to make a vaccine.

527
00:27:59.172 --> 00:28:02.922
Technology is changing very,
very quickly and what has happened

528
00:28:02.922 --> 00:28:05.839
is that the same number
of participants have been

529
00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:10.839
exposed to this vaccine,
this particular vaccine,

530
00:28:11.547 --> 00:28:16.547
43,000 participants and when you are
looking at side effects,

531
00:28:16.547 --> 00:28:19.630
most of the side effects occur very
quickly, within one week

532
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.755
or so of having a vaccine,
we would see any severe side effects

533
00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:27.255
at this stage and no
regulatory authority,

534
00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:31.547
whether it is the UK medicines
regulatory authority or the European

535
00:28:31.547 --> 00:28:35.880
regulatory authority or the FDA
will let anything go through that

536
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.922
does not have a totally
squea ky—clean safety record.

537
00:28:42.505 --> 00:28:46.589
Now, one thing that I think people
completely forget is that a vaccine

538
00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:50.505
stimulates your immune system,
it tricks it to see if it has seen

539
00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:53.922
the virus, so you are getting
an aspect of a viral infection,

540
00:28:53.922 --> 00:28:58.630
that is so much minor
than the real virus,

541
00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:03.214
so when you think about the risk
benefit, the risk of having a severe

542
00:29:03.214 --> 00:29:08.172
outcome from Covid—19 for outweighs
any theoretical risk of a vaccine

543
00:29:10.089 --> 00:29:14.714
and the problem is vaccines
are so successful that diseases go

544
00:29:14.714 --> 00:29:19.755
away and all you see
is the side effects.

545
00:29:23.547 --> 00:29:26.172
Pour out any medicine, paracetamol,
we have probably all had it,

546
00:29:26.172 --> 00:29:29.672
and look at the potential side
effects of paracetamol.

547
00:29:29.672 --> 00:29:33.047
If you had never taken before, it
would probably scare you to take it,

548
00:29:33.047 --> 00:29:35.172
but you don’t have the same
concerns, because you

549
00:29:35.172 --> 00:29:38.047
are familiar with it.

550
00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:41.630
And I think the way we will build
confidence is when we roll it out

551
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.255
to vulnerable populations,
who are desperate for a vaccine,

552
00:29:44.255 --> 00:29:49.255
to get their lives back to some sort
of normality and we see it

553
00:29:49.297 --> 00:29:52.672
protecting lives and we see it
being safe, I am sure people

554
00:29:52.672 --> 00:29:57.672
like Jay will start to see
the evidence speaks for itself.

555
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:03.755
Stewart, you have got a question.

556
00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:05.005
Good evening, panel, yes.

557
00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:07.172
For those that are not
in the initial bracket

558
00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:10.130
to receive the vaccine,
will they still need to abide

559
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.005
by the social distancing or even
face the potential of going back

560
00:30:13.005 --> 00:30:16.047
into lockdowns as well?

561
00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:17.922
Yes, how is this
going to work, Matt?

562
00:30:17.922 --> 00:30:21.089
Will there be a section
of the population who can go party,

563
00:30:21.089 --> 00:30:25.964
while everyone else has to wait,
or how’s it to work?

564
00:30:25.964 --> 00:30:28.839
Because at first we don’t know
whether, even if you have had

565
00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:31.922
the vaccine, you might
still transmit the disease,

566
00:30:31.922 --> 00:30:35.755
that means that we can’t lift those
measures on just the people who have

567
00:30:35.755 --> 00:30:40.130
had the vaccine, because you still
might give it to someone else

568
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:44.755
and what we have to do is vaccinate
to protect the most vulnerable

569
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:49.755
and then get to the position
where enough people have had it

570
00:30:50.255 --> 00:30:54.880
and we will of course monitor
afterwards, as we vaccinate

571
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.755
the population come out to find out
the impact on the transmission

572
00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:59.839
of the disease.

573
00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:03.714
All of this is about how to get life
back to normal as fast

574
00:31:03.714 --> 00:31:07.464
as possible and the reason,
another reason to do this in terms

575
00:31:07.464 --> 00:31:11.005
of clinical priority,
to your point earlier,

576
00:31:11.005 --> 00:31:15.839
is that the faster we can vaccinate
those who are most vulnerable

577
00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:20.172
of dying from Covid,
the sooner we will be able to start

578
00:31:20.172 --> 00:31:25.130
to get life back to normal
for everybody else as well.

579
00:31:25.922 --> 00:31:29.755
So, this is another of those
questions that at the moment

580
00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:34.714
is unknowable, but the plan to roll
out, according to clinical priority,

581
00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:37.839
is the best way to get,
as fast as possible,

582
00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:40.422
to as much back to
normal as possible.

583
00:31:43.964 --> 00:31:46.880
Merryn, as far as business
is concerned, this is the time frame

584
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.172
they desperately need.

585
00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:55.172
When will businesses be able to open
up and operate normally again?

586
00:31:57.505 --> 00:31:59.714
That would be an absolute
game—changer, just the knowledge

587
00:31:59.714 --> 00:32:04.672
that there will be a vaccine
by spring and let’s say that

588
00:32:05.172 --> 00:32:07.089
most vulnerable people and people
have been vaccinated

589
00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:09.255
by late spring, then
I am sure Matt might

590
00:32:09.255 --> 00:32:12.339
have a different opinion of it,
but I would think that the majority

591
00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:15.005
of the economy could open up
properly and if businesses know

592
00:32:15.005 --> 00:32:17.672
of the economy could open up
properly and if businesses know

593
00:32:17.672 --> 00:32:20.505
that they can move out of this
appalling cycle of not knowing

594
00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:22.672
what is going to happen,
of hyper regulatory activity,

595
00:32:22.672 --> 00:32:25.214
lockdown this, tier this,
curfew this, rules all over

596
00:32:25.214 --> 00:32:27.589
the place, up, Down, up, Down,
up, Down, never knowing

597
00:32:27.589 --> 00:32:30.255
exactly where they are,
if they can start looking forward

598
00:32:30.255 --> 00:32:33.797
to a future that is linear,
where things don’t change

599
00:32:33.797 --> 00:32:36.464
all the time, then they can start
moving their businesses around

600
00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:39.005
to make them work again.

601
00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:42.755
So, in that sense, it is an absolute
game—changer for business

602
00:32:42.755 --> 00:32:47.714
and that is why you saw these
astonishing moves in

603
00:32:48.547 --> 00:32:50.714
the stock market on Monday
when you saw effectively

604
00:32:50.714 --> 00:32:53.005
all the companies that
are geared into the return

605
00:32:53.005 --> 00:32:55.630
of normal life, airlines,
pubs, etc go completely berserk

606
00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.005
and all the stocks that are geared
into the nightmare that we live now,

607
00:32:59.005 --> 00:33:00.922
like working from home, etc,
fall very significantly,

608
00:33:00.922 --> 00:33:03.547
so it means that the economy has
finally started to look

609
00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:05.714
forward to, as I say,
something a bit more

610
00:33:05.714 --> 00:33:08.589
linear, less choppy.

611
00:33:08.589 --> 00:33:12.214
Andy, you have had your hand up
for a while, but you have also got

612
00:33:12.214 --> 00:33:14.589
a specific question that I know
you wanted to ask.

613
00:33:14.589 --> 00:33:18.714
Yeah, so I will cover
both of that in order.

614
00:33:18.714 --> 00:33:22.172
There is a priority list,
NHS workers, health

615
00:33:22.172 --> 00:33:26.297
and social care workers,
etc, I wonder where the unpaid

616
00:33:26.297 --> 00:33:28.422
carers are that are sort
of the unsung heroes,

617
00:33:28.422 --> 00:33:30.839
caring for family members,
where they are in this priority

618
00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:34.130
list, because they don’t seem
to be mentioned nationally?

619
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.672
Let us just find out.

620
00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:40.047
Are they going to be
in the priority list?

621
00:33:40.047 --> 00:33:42.964
Defining the social care workers...

622
00:33:42.964 --> 00:33:45.547
These are sort of unpaid carers.

623
00:33:45.547 --> 00:33:49.047
Yes, but my goodness,
they may be unpaid,...

624
00:33:49.047 --> 00:33:51.880
I’m not downgrading what they do,
I am saying will they be

625
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.005
in the first wave?

626
00:33:54.005 --> 00:33:57.964
Well, theJoint Committee that
advises me will define exactly how

627
00:33:57.964 --> 00:34:00.172
broad that category is.

628
00:34:00.172 --> 00:34:03.172
Would you like to see them in there?

629
00:34:03.172 --> 00:34:05.089
I would like to follow
the clinical advice.

630
00:34:05.089 --> 00:34:08.922
I know I am not giving an answer
and I think that is because I think

631
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:11.297
it is really important
that we follow the clinical advice.

632
00:34:11.297 --> 00:34:16.297
Andy, why don’t you put
the question that you have

633
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.797
prepared as well.

634
00:34:21.797 --> 00:34:24.464
Transport, post Brexit,
is key as we rely on the vaccine

635
00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:27.839
being expedited through customs
and other such barriers,

636
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:32.880
how will we ensure the Brexit post
January importation of the vaccine

637
00:34:38.547 --> 00:34:41.422
does not have an impact on Covid,
the two don’t be sort

638
00:34:41.422 --> 00:34:43.339
of playing against each other
with swaying priorities?

639
00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:46.005
This is something that came up
from a lot of members

640
00:34:46.005 --> 00:34:47.047
of the audience, actually.

641
00:34:47.047 --> 00:34:50.380
Look, we were told by Boris that we
would have an oven ready deal.

642
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.255
We have no deal, we have Boris
putting the Good Friday Agreement

643
00:34:53.255 --> 00:34:58.047
on the table, which jeopardises that
deal, we have got the Chief

644
00:34:58.047 --> 00:35:03.005
Executive of the Port of Dover
saying that a no—deal Brexit

645
00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:10.047
could cost us, I think
it was a billion a week,

646
00:35:10.047 --> 00:35:12.422
and that traffic ﬂows could be down
by between 40—60%.

647
00:35:12.422 --> 00:35:14.839
The clock is ticking,
we are running out of time

648
00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:18.380
and it is now looking worrying
that we will have no deal

649
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.505
with the European Union
and we will have no deal by the way

650
00:35:21.505 --> 00:35:24.172
with the United States of America,
because we would have risked

651
00:35:24.172 --> 00:35:29.172
the Good Friday Agreement by having
that no deal.

652
00:35:29.964 --> 00:35:32.339
Look, it is desperately
important that we get a deal,

653
00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:35.005
that it is frictionless trade,
that it does not involve tariffs,

654
00:35:35.005 --> 00:35:40.005
that we have got food safety,
we have got health safety,

655
00:35:44.672 --> 00:35:47.047
that we have not got queues
and lorries backed up

656
00:35:47.047 --> 00:35:50.380
and I suspect a lot of people,
in an area like Dover are really

657
00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.714
worried, because a lot of promises
were being made and we wait to see

658
00:35:53.714 --> 00:35:56.380
what will happen, but we know
we have now got days,

659
00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.089
days, to deliver this,
against the backdrop

660
00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.714
days, to deliver this,
against the backdrop,

661
00:35:59.714 --> 00:36:01.964
and just remember, a lot
of people were saying,

662
00:36:01.964 --> 00:36:04.297
look, this is tough,
we have got all the European

663
00:36:04.297 --> 00:36:06.255
countries dealing with this
pandemic, we have got

664
00:36:06.255 --> 00:36:09.172
all European countries dealing
with the economic consequences,

665
00:36:09.172 --> 00:36:12.005
let’s have a little extension,
while we work this out.

666
00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:14.922
IF}

667
00:36:14.922 --> 00:36:17.505
We’re going to have a deal.

668
00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:20.172
We’re going to put the Good Friday
Agreement on the table.

669
00:36:20.172 --> 00:36:22.089
It’s a mess, but we need the deal.

670
00:36:22.089 --> 00:36:23.172
Over to Matt Hancock.

671
00:36:23.172 --> 00:36:26.255
Hang on, before we get to Matt,
Donna, I know there was something

672
00:36:26.255 --> 00:36:31.089
you wanted to add into this
particular subject as well.

673
00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:33.255
Yes, absolutely.

674
00:36:33.255 --> 00:36:38.255
On the lst of January, 2021,
will Dover become a well oiled

675
00:36:39.089 --> 00:36:42.172
gateway to Europe or the biggest car
and lorry park in the world?

676
00:36:42.172 --> 00:36:47.172
And it all plays into
the same thing, doesn’t it?

677
00:36:48.714 --> 00:36:51.089
A, what is going to happen
the end of December,

678
00:36:51.089 --> 00:36:53.964
but also in terms of us getting this
vaccine and getting it

679
00:36:53.964 --> 00:36:56.130
through customs, is that
going to be a problem?

680
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.047
Is this something that
you thought about, Robin,

681
00:36:58.047 --> 00:36:59.464
is this a concern for you?

682
00:36:59.464 --> 00:37:01.672
We haven’t thought about this
directly in terms of

683
00:37:01.672 --> 00:37:04.255
what the immediate priority is,
but we certainly recognise,

684
00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:06.422
in the UK, particularly
as we go through Brexit,

685
00:37:06.422 --> 00:37:11.422
that we need to really ramp up UK
manufacturing capacity,

686
00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:17.672
so that we can make vaccines
and we have the cutting edge

687
00:37:17.672 --> 00:37:20.339
technology in this country
and I think one of the things

688
00:37:20.339 --> 00:37:23.172
that we recognise is,
from a pragmatic point of view,

689
00:37:23.172 --> 00:37:27.339
we have made, the government has
made purchase of six vaccines,

690
00:37:27.339 --> 00:37:32.339
five of those are from overseas.

691
00:37:33.089 --> 00:37:36.172
That is actually increasing our
reliance on overseas production.

692
00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:38.255
You are involved in
developing a vaccine as well

693
00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:40.214
at Imperial College.

694
00:37:40.214 --> 00:37:42.839
We are one of the two UK teams
developing a vaccine.

695
00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:45.297
Are you getting funding
from the government as well?

696
00:37:45.297 --> 00:37:47.005
We are getting funding
from the government,

697
00:37:47.005 --> 00:37:50.339
but it is still requires a huge
effort for us to build a technology

698
00:37:50.339 --> 00:37:55.339
from scratch and to give the kind
of examples of the competition,

699
00:37:58.297 --> 00:38:01.255
there are 30 R&A companies
around the world.

700
00:38:01.255 --> 00:38:06.214
This is the particular technology
that Pfizer have used?

701
00:38:06.214 --> 00:38:11.214
It is a new technology at a tipping
point and our competition,

702
00:38:14.672 --> 00:38:16.547
our direct competition,
are two companies in Germany,

703
00:38:16.547 --> 00:38:19.422
one of which is BioNTech,
and they got grants from the German

704
00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:23.839
government of 350 million
and 250 million apiece,

705
00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:27.214
even though they are well funded,
and so we need to think in terms

706
00:38:27.214 --> 00:38:30.297
of the strategy as to how
we are going to nurture a vaccine

707
00:38:30.297 --> 00:38:34.422
industry, which is more thanjust
start—up, that is sustainable

708
00:38:34.422 --> 00:38:39.464
and has a long—term strategic plan.

709
00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:51.714
Are you getting those kind of sums
from the Secretary for Health?

710
00:38:51.714 --> 00:38:54.339
We are getting support and we fully
anticipate that the government

711
00:38:54.339 --> 00:38:57.005
will want to see the two flagship
vaccine programme is being

712
00:38:57.005 --> 00:38:58.089
supported to the hilt.

713
00:38:58.089 --> 00:38:59.089
Daniel.

714
00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:01.005
Picking up on the Shadow
Justice Secretary’s point,

715
00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.630
will the defeat in the House
of Lords of the clauses

716
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.547
of the Internal Market Bill
on Monday have any impact

717
00:39:06.547 --> 00:39:09.172
on government policy, especially
with a President—electJoe Biden?

718
00:39:09.172 --> 00:39:14.172
Antonio?

719
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:20.172
Hello there.

720
00:39:22.172 --> 00:39:23.797
My question, in fact, is for Matt.

721
00:39:23.797 --> 00:39:27.255
Matt has mentioned that there
are several companies, several deals

722
00:39:27.255 --> 00:39:31.714
going on regarding the vaccine
and I just want to know,

723
00:39:31.714 --> 00:39:34.005
these pharmaceutical
companies that are involved,

724
00:39:34.005 --> 00:39:38.422
will make an enormous
amount of money.

725
00:39:38.422 --> 00:39:42.797
My question to Matt is this,
does the government have any

726
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:45.005
strategies in place to ensure
that these pharmaceutical companies

727
00:39:45.005 --> 00:39:47.589
give back to the system
from their profits, to ensure that

728
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:50.255
everyone in the UK who wants
the vaccine can have it,

729
00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:52.922
rather than being held to ransom
for what they can produce

730
00:39:52.922 --> 00:39:57.880
and what the government wants
to pay for the vaccine?

731
00:40:02.172 --> 00:40:07.130
Justin.

732
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.922
Sorry.

733
00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:13.589
Sorry, while this announcement
is welcome, does Mr Hancock think it

734
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:15.755
goes anywhere near to placating
an increasingly apathetic population

735
00:40:15.755 --> 00:40:18.589
who, for the last nine months,
have been drip fed a series

736
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:23.630
of failures and costly failure
and double standards.

737
00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:29.297
Joe.

738
00:40:30.089 --> 00:40:33.464
Yes, I think the answer given
that the NHS will be able to manage

739
00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:36.547
the roll—out and the NHS will do it,
the NHS relies on subcontractors

740
00:40:36.547 --> 00:40:41.589
to do the job of rolling it out.

741
00:40:46.672 --> 00:40:49.755
Recently, the vetting has suffered
and I have also heard rumours

742
00:40:49.755 --> 00:40:53.130
that there are simply not enough
medical grade vials

743
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:58.089
or lorries around in order...

744
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.339
Or even PPE, for the roll—out
of this vaccine, so to say

745
00:41:04.422 --> 00:41:07.589
that the NHS will do it, well,
the NHS can only do it

746
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:11.255
if they get the support
in order to do theirjob,

747
00:41:11.255 --> 00:41:15.005
so, you know, it would be
a monumental waste of money

748
00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:19.964
to buy the vaccine...

749
00:41:26.464 --> 00:41:27.880
and it becoming effective.

750
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.255
Well, lots and lots of different
points there and I am going to drag

751
00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.464
us back for a moment,
to the original question,

752
00:41:33.464 --> 00:41:35.339
which came from Andy,
about confidence, about getting

753
00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:36.839
the vaccine through.

754
00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:37.922
Yes.

755
00:41:37.922 --> 00:41:39.089
Post the end of December.

756
00:41:39.089 --> 00:41:41.422
Are you utterly confident...

757
00:41:41.422 --> 00:41:46.464
We have heard all sorts
of warnings from road hauliers,

758
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.672
about not being ready,
about hold—ups at Customs, you know,

759
00:41:49.672 --> 00:41:52.839
lorry parks and all the rest of us,
or are you confident that

760
00:41:52.839 --> 00:41:55.130
that is not going to be a problem?

761
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.797
We have a plan for the vaccine
which is being manufactured

762
00:41:57.797 --> 00:42:00.422
in Belgium and, if necessary,
we can fly it in order

763
00:42:00.422 --> 00:42:03.589
to avoid those problems.

764
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:06.005
It is a lot more expensive
than getting it through

765
00:42:06.005 --> 00:42:07.255
on a lorry, isn’t it?

766
00:42:07.255 --> 00:42:09.339
Well, the importance of this vaccine
cannot be underestimated,

767
00:42:09.339 --> 00:42:12.005
so we have got a plan
for all eventualities and many

768
00:42:12.005 --> 00:42:14.672
of the points that were made,
some of the excellent points

769
00:42:14.672 --> 00:42:19.630
about some of the challenges,
like Joe’s point about the fact that

770
00:42:26.005 --> 00:42:27.964
vaccinators needed PPE,
absolutely that is a critical

771
00:42:27.964 --> 00:42:30.880
part of the plan.

772
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.255
So, it underlines how this
is a hugely complex project,

773
00:42:33.255 --> 00:42:36.380
but it is one that we have been
preparing for for some time.

774
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.547
So, you are confident that Brexit,
if we do leave the European Union

775
00:42:39.547 --> 00:42:42.672
without a deal, is not going to hold
up the delivery of the

776
00:42:42.672 --> 00:42:43.672
vaccines to this country?

777
00:42:43.672 --> 00:42:46.797
I am confident of that,
we have a plan for all of these

778
00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:50.714
eventualities, yes.

779
00:42:50.714 --> 00:42:53.339
Rosie, I think you
wanted to come in.

780
00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:58.339
I have just set here,
increasingly getting annoyed

781
00:43:03.255 --> 00:43:08.255
because I think we are hearing great
points and you’re taking the easy

782
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:18.630
questions and sharing one
answer and then moving on.

783
00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:29.172
I wanted to come here today and talk
about the vaccine and feel reassured

784
00:43:31.547 --> 00:43:36.589
that we are going to go into 2021
and be in a much better

785
00:43:47.339 --> 00:43:52.380
and safer place and I don’t
know if we will be.

786
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:55.339
I absolutely think there is a point
at which this vaccine

787
00:43:55.339 --> 00:43:58.714
that we heard about on Monday,
it is good news, but we are not

788
00:43:58.714 --> 00:44:01.839
there yet and there are still a lot
of steps that we need

789
00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:06.880
to get through.

790
00:44:07.047 --> 00:44:10.130
So, I am only going to reassure
you and anybody else as much

791
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.505
as I can be confident about.

792
00:44:13.505 --> 00:44:18.505
You’re not reassuring me at all.

793
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:21.464
Well, lam being honest
about the uncertainties

794
00:44:21.464 --> 00:44:26.464
that we still face and I think
that is what I am duty—bound to do.

795
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:32.380
There are some things I am more
confident about, like, for instance,

796
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.422
we have done the work to make sure
we have the —70 capacity...

797
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.214
Can you even tell us when people
might first get the vaccine?

798
00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:45.839
Well, we are planning
that if all goes well,

799
00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:49.589
including the safety coming
through and including

800
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:53.797
the manufacturing going well
by Pfizer, we are planning to be

801
00:44:53.797 --> 00:44:56.672
able to roll—out from the start
of December, which is not long.

802
00:44:56.672 --> 00:44:59.089
One of the co—founders
of the company that is manufacturing

803
00:44:59.089 --> 00:45:01.714
this vaccine said, not before mid
December, so you are not

804
00:45:01.714 --> 00:45:02.922
quite on the same page.

805
00:45:02.922 --> 00:45:06.880
Well, as I say, we are planning
to be ready from the 1st

806
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.964
of December, but we are not
guaranteeing that by any

807
00:45:10.964 --> 00:45:13.297
stretch and, you know,
it would be easier, you know,

808
00:45:13.297 --> 00:45:17.339
in the moment, for me to say,
no problem, all sorted,

809
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:21.005
we are just not there yet,
though, but what we can’t say

810
00:45:21.005 --> 00:45:23.880
is that we are making progress
towards where we need to be,

811
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.380
but there are many, many hurdles
for us still to go over.

812
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:32.464
Merryn.

813
00:45:32.464 --> 00:45:35.130
I just wanted to work
on reassuring Rosie a little bit,

814
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.005
because I think we are talking
about the vaccine at great length,

815
00:45:38.005 --> 00:45:40.380
which is incredibly interesting
and very exciting and gives me

816
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.297
enormous hope that we
are at the beginning

817
00:45:42.297 --> 00:45:45.214
of the end of the whole thing,
but we are not talking

818
00:45:45.214 --> 00:45:49.214
about the various treatments that
have been coming along as well,

819
00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:52.547
so while we wait for the vaccine
to be rolled out and for everyone

820
00:45:52.547 --> 00:45:55.922
to get it, there is also a cheap
steroid that is working quite well,

821
00:45:55.922 --> 00:45:59.047
there is a UK based company
that is in place to use trials

822
00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:02.422
in using a drug that is known to be
very cheap working in different

823
00:46:02.422 --> 00:46:05.047
illnesses that could work very well
and it has been shown

824
00:46:05.047 --> 00:46:09.880
in a clinical trial,
so it is not just about the vaccine,

825
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.797
it is also about the fact
that we know there are very

826
00:46:12.797 --> 00:46:15.172
good treatments there,
we know that death rates have been

827
00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:17.297
falling during the second wave
over the first wave,

828
00:46:17.297 --> 00:46:19.964
in older people in particular,
we know that the mortality rate

829
00:46:19.964 --> 00:46:24.130
as a whole is very low
and we are also learning more

830
00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.005
and more about how and where it
translates and I am sure

831
00:46:27.005 --> 00:46:29.630
we will then get onto
whether lockdown is a good idea

832
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.505
or not later, but we know
for example that you don’t normally

833
00:46:32.505 --> 00:46:36.255
get Covid when you’re out
shopping, for example.

834
00:46:36.255 --> 00:46:39.297
So, you know, we are beginning
to know more and more about how

835
00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:41.464
we can live relatively normal lives
with good treatments,

836
00:46:41.464 --> 00:46:43.380
regardless of exactly
when the vaccine is rolled

837
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.464
out or not.

838
00:46:44.464 --> 00:46:48.839
Merryn, you haven’t had a chance
to answer the question

839
00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:51.255
about trying to get the vaccine
through if we leave

840
00:46:51.255 --> 00:46:56.255
the EU without a deal.

841
00:46:59.255 --> 00:47:02.714
I leave that to Matt because I’m
sure there are ways of getting back

842
00:47:02.714 --> 00:47:05.464
things through long lorry cues,
but I am sure that the government

843
00:47:05.464 --> 00:47:07.922
has organised, but the wider
question is presumably about Brexit

844
00:47:07.922 --> 00:47:12.880
and whether there will be very long
lorry cues in Dover if we go

845
00:47:13.422 --> 00:47:16.297
through with this on WTO terms under
specific FTA and the answer

846
00:47:16.297 --> 00:47:21.255
to that is there probably will be
very long queues in Dover,

847
00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:23.839
but there will probably belong
lorry queues regardless

848
00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:27.005
of whether we have a deal or not,
because all change that involves

849
00:47:27.005 --> 00:47:29.839
lots of pieces of paper and admin
and new types of organisation

850
00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:31.630
results in difficulties
and hold—ups and blockages,

851
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.755
but that will, I would guess,
only last two or three months before

852
00:47:34.755 --> 00:47:38.172
we come out the other end and that
will be unpleasant for the people

853
00:47:38.172 --> 00:47:41.255
involved in it, but if you believe
that Brexit is a good thing

854
00:47:41.255 --> 00:47:44.172
for the country long term,
it will end up being a relatively

855
00:47:44.172 --> 00:47:47.005
small price to pay, I hope.

856
00:47:47.005 --> 00:47:52.047
Let’s take another question now
on a different topic from Jamie.

857
00:47:52.672 --> 00:47:55.255
Hello, panel.

858
00:47:55.255 --> 00:47:58.589
So, having had a Disability
Discrimination Act for a 25 years,

859
00:47:58.589 --> 00:48:03.547
are we now treating people with more
respect and equality?

860
00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:07.339
Well, Rosie, I’m not trying
to pigeonhole you here, but I’m in,

861
00:48:07.339 --> 00:48:10.630
in a sense you are the obvious
person to answer this.

862
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.547
Ican’t imagine!

863
00:48:12.547 --> 00:48:17.214
But, give us the benefit
of your experience.

864
00:48:17.214 --> 00:48:22.255
So, the disability act came
in in 1995, I was five years old,

865
00:48:27.297 --> 00:48:32.339
and without a doubt,
my life has been

866
00:48:32.797 --> 00:48:37.839
better because of it.

867
00:48:38.714 --> 00:48:43.630
I had an education at a mainstream
school, I went to university,

868
00:48:48.547 --> 00:48:53.589
I got a job and with by cerebral
palsy, I have been a successful

869
00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.839
and independent human being and I am
proud of who I am and I can’t

870
00:49:23.505 --> 00:49:26.464
ground—breaking disability act.

871
00:49:38.714 --> 00:49:41.339
Saying that, we are 25 years
on and whenever I walk

872
00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:43.672
in the street alone,

873
00:49:43.672 --> 00:49:48.714
I wear headphones, because of how
I walk and I talk, I get

874
00:49:51.047 --> 00:49:56.089
abuse on a daily basis.

875
00:49:59.047 --> 00:50:02.172
I am not alone and not.

876
00:50:02.172 --> 00:50:07.130
I am not alone and not I have had
times of unemployment,

877
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:13.630
unemployment is huge
amongst disabled people.

878
00:50:21.255 --> 00:50:26.297
I have tried to apply forjobs
and I have been hung up

879
00:50:30.464 --> 00:50:35.422
on because of how I speak and I am
not alone, because right now

880
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:43.589
a quarter of a million disabled
people are unemployed

881
00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:51.880
and because of Covid,
that is rising.

882
00:50:54.339 --> 00:50:59.339
I was going to say that disabled
people are overlooked,

883
00:51:03.422 --> 00:51:08.380
but they are not, they are
deliberately ignored,

884
00:51:10.547 --> 00:51:15.589
because disabled people need more
care and more money and I don’t feel

885
00:51:21.839 --> 00:51:26.839
like, as a disabled person,
I am getting the care

886
00:51:29.922 --> 00:51:34.130
and support I made right now.

887
00:51:37.339 --> 00:51:39.922
David.

888
00:51:39.922 --> 00:51:43.714
Well, I mean, it is
hard to follow that.

889
00:51:43.714 --> 00:51:47.797
And that was very
moving to listen to.

890
00:51:47.797 --> 00:51:50.005
Look, I suspect of course
there has been progress

891
00:51:50.005 --> 00:51:54.255
over the last 25 years,
but we have got a long way to go.

892
00:51:54.255 --> 00:51:59.255
Let me just say, I have three
children and one of them has sort

893
00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:05.339
of educational special needs
and I know the struggle

894
00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:07.505
of parents in this country
when they are trying

895
00:52:07.505 --> 00:52:09.380
to get a statement.

896
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:14.422
Of course there is still huge
discrimination in employment.

897
00:52:14.922 --> 00:52:17.255
I was thinking of the young
black man dragged out

898
00:52:17.255 --> 00:52:22.255
of the Oxford Union,
blind, just a year or so ago.

899
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:29.255
I think that there is a lot to do
in this country and we probably have

900
00:52:29.255 --> 00:52:34.255
to return to the legislation
that is required.

901
00:52:34.422 --> 00:52:36.964
If you look at that story
of the 20th century,

902
00:52:36.964 --> 00:52:39.880
it is a lot of people
at the beginning of that century,

903
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.422
certainly the disabled,
anyone with educational needs,

904
00:52:43.422 --> 00:52:47.755
black and brown people,
women, working people,

905
00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:51.047
all oppressed in some ways,
put down and by the end

906
00:52:51.047 --> 00:52:55.172
of the 20th century,
beginning to get their rights.

907
00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:57.839
But we are still on thatjourney.

908
00:52:57.839 --> 00:53:02.464
And as we go into a deep recession,
we know that the people who can be

909
00:53:02.464 --> 00:53:06.880
deeply affected or those
with disabilities and,

910
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.922
let me just say, if you defund local
authorities like we have in this

911
00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:15.214
country, if you have got local
authorities like Croydon

912
00:53:15.214 --> 00:53:19.172
or Northampton going bust,
with budget cuts of 50%,

913
00:53:19.172 --> 00:53:23.255
where is the money for adult social
care that the disabled depend on?

914
00:53:23.255 --> 00:53:26.255
Where is the money for the kit
and equipment that people

915
00:53:26.255 --> 00:53:29.755
need in their homes?

916
00:53:29.755 --> 00:53:33.547
All the money being cut in day
centres, right across the country?

917
00:53:33.547 --> 00:53:36.505
So it is not a rosy picture,
in some ways it feels

918
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:39.255
like a rollback and I endorse
what has been said.

919
00:53:39.255 --> 00:53:41.005
Robin.

920
00:53:41.005 --> 00:53:45.964
I mean, I think the point is that
in terms of either being overlooked

921
00:53:45.964 --> 00:53:50.339
or deliberately ignored is something
that society continues to need to be

922
00:53:50.339 --> 00:53:55.339
challenged on and disability
comes in many shapes.

923
00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:00.589
Visible disability often
leads to abuse, but also

924
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:05.297
I am very conscious,
one of my daughters has a chromosome

925
00:54:05.297 --> 00:54:07.672
abnormality and she has no
physical disability,

926
00:54:07.672 --> 00:54:11.214
but she is disadvantaged by a hidden
disability and I think

927
00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:13.964
that is also a problem,
a hidden problem that people don’t

928
00:54:13.964 --> 00:54:18.839
necessarily recognise.

929
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:22.297
I think it is so critical that
individuals like yourself,

930
00:54:22.297 --> 00:54:26.464
Rosie, challenge the rest
of society repeatedly.

931
00:54:26.464 --> 00:54:31.505
The fight needs to go on and we can
never be relaxed and not

932
00:54:32.714 --> 00:54:34.255
challenge ourselves,
whether it is disability

933
00:54:34.255 --> 00:54:37.422
or any type of prejudice.

934
00:54:37.422 --> 00:54:42.464
Merryn.

935
00:54:46.922 --> 00:54:49.964
I haven’t much to add to that to be
honest, except to say

936
00:54:49.964 --> 00:54:52.630
that from what we hear,
there are not that many families

937
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.714
in the UK but are not in some way
touched by the difficulties

938
00:54:55.714 --> 00:54:57.880
of having someone with a disability
inside theirfamily.

939
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.047
Obviously, there is a lot more to be
done to help everybody without,

940
00:55:01.047 --> 00:55:04.339
but I would also say that we must
not underestimate how far we have,

941
00:55:04.339 --> 00:55:05.547
over the last 25 years.

942
00:55:05.547 --> 00:55:07.964
Everybody now understands,
which I don’t think they did then,

943
00:55:07.964 --> 00:55:10.339
that lack of access to transport,
to buildings, to education,

944
00:55:10.339 --> 00:55:14.214
to employment etc was a travesty
and now it is considered to be

945
00:55:14.214 --> 00:55:16.172
something that everyone
should have access to.

946
00:55:16.172 --> 00:55:18.839
So, there has been huge change
over the last 25 years,

947
00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:22.172
obviously there is a long way to go,
but we must remember how far

948
00:55:22.172 --> 00:55:23.714
we have come as well.

949
00:55:23.714 --> 00:55:26.422
Merryn, I was quite surprised
to learn that rules on accessible

950
00:55:26.422 --> 00:55:28.589
public transport came into force
on buses and coaches

951
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:31.714
from the end of this year.

952
00:55:31.714 --> 00:55:33.630
So many years after
the Disability Discrimination Act,

953
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.755
rail replacement buses,
for example 60% of those

954
00:55:35.755 --> 00:55:38.172
are not accessible.

955
00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:39.839
There are quite a few hands up.

956
00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:41.130
Emily.

957
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.130
Thank you.

958
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:48.172
I just want to applaud Rosie
on that, but also I want to raise

959
00:55:48.214 --> 00:55:50.547
an issue that was just mentioned
about SEN and children

960
00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:55.589
struggling in schools.

961
00:56:00.547 --> 00:56:02.714
The delays in diagnosis
of neurodifferences at the moment

962
00:56:02.714 --> 00:56:05.797
is over three years in most areas,
including Kent, and Covid is only

963
00:56:05.797 --> 00:56:07.047
going to increase that delay.

964
00:56:07.047 --> 00:56:09.422
The Disability Discrimination Act
give us the right to education,

965
00:56:09.422 --> 00:56:12.255
there are lots of children that
are not able to access education

966
00:56:12.255 --> 00:56:14.214
because they are still
waiting for a diagnosis.

967
00:56:14.214 --> 00:56:16.130
What is going to be done about that?

968
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.214
Donna.

969
00:56:17.214 --> 00:56:20.255
I think we need to remember that
anyone of us can become disabled

970
00:56:20.255 --> 00:56:22.172
at any point in time.

971
00:56:22.172 --> 00:56:24.297
So, when we are supporting
an increase in access

972
00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:25.797
for disabled people,
we are actually

973
00:56:25.797 --> 00:56:29.755
supporting ourselves.

974
00:56:29.755 --> 00:56:31.255
We are supporting
the entire country.

975
00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:36.255
So, I think, looking at this as just
issues for disabled people

976
00:56:36.255 --> 00:56:39.297
is I don’t think it’s helpful,
it is about how do we increase

977
00:56:39.297 --> 00:56:44.339
access for all of us,
including disabled people.

978
00:56:45.089 --> 00:56:48.255
That is how I think
we should look at this.

979
00:56:48.255 --> 00:56:50.630
Daniel.

980
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.047
Is it a matter of adding
new legislation or becoming

981
00:56:53.047 --> 00:56:56.755
a lessjudgmental society?

982
00:56:56.755 --> 00:57:01.755
Matt.

983
00:57:04.797 --> 00:57:07.630
Well, I had admire you so much,
Rosie, for the way that

984
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:08.672
you articulate this

985
00:57:08.672 --> 00:57:11.964
and I thought what Emily said
was so strong, in a small way,

986
00:57:11.964 --> 00:57:15.547
I am neuro diverse, I am dyslexic,
and it took me until I was 18

987
00:57:15.547 --> 00:57:20.130
until I was diagnosed and then I got
the support I needed and it made

988
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:25.172
an enormous difference to me.

989
00:57:25.922 --> 00:57:28.922
But I was lucky, because I was able,
I was essentially able

990
00:57:28.922 --> 00:57:33.922
to get by on my maths,
despite the fact that my language

991
00:57:34.255 --> 00:57:39.297
skills were very poor, my written
language skills at school.

992
00:57:40.922 --> 00:57:45.922
So, I have feltjust a tiny bit
of what that feels like,

993
00:57:46.297 --> 00:57:51.255
but I think that Daniel’s point
is so important, which is of course

994
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:57.672
legislation is important,
and that is something we should

995
00:57:58.922 --> 00:58:02.672
always be pushing forward,
like with the change in the bosses

996
00:58:02.672 --> 00:58:05.547
at the end of this year,
I did not know about that,

997
00:58:05.547 --> 00:58:09.172
I think that is really important,
but my God, how long has it taken us

998
00:58:09.172 --> 00:58:10.339
to get to this point?

999
00:58:10.339 --> 00:58:13.005
But it is also about society
accepting everyone and looking

1000
00:58:13.005 --> 00:58:15.255
for the good in everyone.

1001
00:58:15.255 --> 00:58:18.755
I think that everyone has something
to contribute and we need...

1002
00:58:18.755 --> 00:58:22.714
It is our task, our mission is to go
and find what is good in people

1003
00:58:22.714 --> 00:58:27.714
and the contribution they can make
and bring it out and support people

1004
00:58:28.255 --> 00:58:33.214
to do that, so I think
there is a long way to go.

1005
00:58:33.297 --> 00:58:36.172
Rosie, we are almost out of time,
I just want to give

1006
00:58:36.172 --> 00:58:37.589
you a final word on this.

1007
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:42.589
I think I would kick
myself about talking

1008
00:58:43.297 --> 00:58:48.297
about the change between the DLA
Disability Living Allowance

1009
00:58:54.255 --> 00:58:59.255
to the personal independence
payment, because 650,000 disabled

1010
00:59:07.214 --> 00:59:12.255
people, including myself,
got caught and this just makes me

1011
00:59:14.005 --> 00:59:18.964
insanely angry that I thought
when I was assessed in 2008 that

1012
00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:38.880
money that kept me going,
that gave me support,

1013
00:59:40.422 --> 00:59:45.464
it was taken off me and luckily
I can work harder, I can push

1014
00:59:50.047 --> 00:59:55.089
myself, but a lot of disabled people
are now on the poverty line,

1015
01:00:00.047 --> 01:00:05.047
because they were assessed
by a stranger for ten minutes

1016
01:00:10.255 --> 01:00:15.255
who would look at them
and go, what do you need?

1017
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:25.630
Thatjust makes my blood boil
and I want to end it by going,

1018
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.339
stop ignoring disabled people.

1019
01:00:39.255 --> 01:00:44.255
We make up 22% of the population.

1020
01:00:49.755 --> 01:00:54.797
We are here and we are
worth listening to!

1021
01:00:56.214 --> 01:01:00.255
Rosie, look at that.

1022
01:01:00.255 --> 01:01:02.672
If there were people
here at the studio with us,

1023
01:01:02.672 --> 01:01:03.839
you would hear the applause.

1024
01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:05.047
You can only see it.

1025
01:01:05.047 --> 01:01:06.089
There you are.

1026
01:01:06.089 --> 01:01:09.005
I wanted to give you the final
word on that Rosie and

1027
01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:10.380
I am very glad I did.

1028
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.464
Ourtime is up.

1029
01:01:11.464 --> 01:01:14.297

1051

Oh, that is absolutely fabulous.

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:59.130
Oh, my goodness!

1053
01:03:01.339 --> 01:03:02.672
That’s amazing.

1054
01:03:02.672 --> 01:03:04.172
You are a master.

1055
01:03:35.755 --> 01:03:35.964
phrase,

1056
01:03:35.964 --> 01:03:43.714
In a change to the schedules,
Newscast tonight

1057
01:03:43.714 --> 01:03:46.880
is going to be Brexitcast —
we are bringing back our old podcast

1058
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.505
because it feels there’s quite
a lot to say on Brexit.

1059
01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:52.130
And the great thing is reality
obliged, because I’ve gone back

1060
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.047
to trying to work out
Michel Barnier’s whereabouts.

1061
01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:56.464
Because at lunchtime today,
he tweeted that he was taking

1062
01:03:56.464 --> 01:03:59.130
a break from the negotiations,
and he went looking for some

1063
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:01.255
level playing fields,
so took a picture of himself

1064
01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:02.297
in a playing field.

1065
01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:07.297
Of course, that is one of the big
disputes in the negotiations.

1066
01:04:09.464 --> 01:04:11.714
We should mention that you’re
chrging on the pitch,

1067
01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:14.297
they think it’s not quite all over,
because there’s seven weeks

1068
01:04:14.297 --> 01:04:16.464
to go and here comes Adam
chasing Michel Barnier.

1069
01:04:16.464 --> 01:04:19.630
And so it was a football pitch
in north London I was told,

1070
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:22.255
so I went to my nearest football
pitch in north London,

1071
01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:23.464
and was Michel Barnier there?

1072
01:04:23.464 --> 01:04:24.505
No, he was not.

1073
01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:25.672
Oh, how did you feel?

1074
01:04:25.672 --> 01:04:29.297
Leaving me — well, it left me
with a sort of sad Gallic shrug that

1075
01:04:29.297 --> 01:04:30.464
I had just missed him.

1076
01:04:30.464 --> 01:04:33.839
Or maybe I had gone to the wrong
football pitch and so I didn’t

1077
01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:35.755
even nearly miss him,
he wasn’t even there.

1078
01:04:35.755 --> 01:04:36.839
That’s possible.

1079
01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.714
Haven’t you kind of tagged him
though, isn’t that why you always

1080
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:42.797
used to find him in Brussels,
or is itjust because the Brussels

1081
01:04:42.797 --> 01:04:45.839
diplomatic quarter is small?

1082
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:48.255
What are we to take though
from his wistful look?

1083
01:04:48.255 --> 01:04:50.672
Look across the playing fields
told by an EU contact?

1084
01:04:50.672 --> 01:04:52.839
Was it gallows humour
or a sign of optimism?

1085
01:04:52.839 --> 01:04:53.839
The former, it said.

1086
01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:54.922
0K.

1087
01:04:54.922 --> 01:04:58.047
And also I think he was probably
trying to take the mickey out

1088
01:04:58.047 --> 01:05:00.422
of the British Government,
for they are being a bit

1089
01:05:00.422 --> 01:05:02.339
tense at the moment,
and he’s quite relaxed.

1090
01:05:02.339 --> 01:05:04.755
So we are bringing Brexitcast back,
which means Katya Adler

1091
01:05:04.755 --> 01:05:06.172
is in the house, from Brussels.

1092
01:05:06.172 --> 01:05:07.214
Hello, Katya.

1093
01:05:07.214 --> 01:05:08.255
Hello.

1094
01:05:08.255 --> 01:05:09.255
And that means...

1095
01:05:09.255 --> 01:05:10.714
That feels so Eurovision,
doesn’t it?

1096
01:05:10.714 --> 01:05:11.755
Yeah.

1097
01:05:11.755 --> 01:05:14.672
It also means we are the only prime
time BBC One programme

1098
01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:15.839
that has a Katya left.

1099
01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:16.922
0h!

1100
01:05:16.922 --> 01:05:17.964
Welcome to Brexitcast.

1101
01:05:17.964 --> 01:05:19.005
Brexitcast.
