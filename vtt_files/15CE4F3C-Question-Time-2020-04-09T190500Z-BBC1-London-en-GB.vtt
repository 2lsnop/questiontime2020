secretary, Dominic Raab, outlined

159
00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:32.644
secretary, Dominic Raab, outlined
eartier,

160
00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:33.686
secretary, Dominic Raab, outlined
earlier, later next week we will

161
00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:34.061
eartier, later next week we will
look at

162
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:38.352
earlier, later next week we will
look at where we have got to. For

163
00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:40.269
look at where we have got to. For
the moment, there is no change to

164
00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:41.936
the moment, there is no change to
the government position and people

165
00:05:41.936 --> 00:05:43.144
the government position and people
should stay home and continue to

166
00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:46.602
should stay home and continue to
follow guidelines. Peter, you are

167
00:05:46.602 --> 00:05:48.102
follow guidelines. Peter, you are
obviously advising the government in

168
00:05:48.102 --> 00:05:51.727
obviously advising the government in
terms of coronavirus and the

169
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:52.686
terms of coronavirus and the
government makes the decisions you

170
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.894
government makes the decisions you
provide advice. What is your view on

171
00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:56.436
provide advice. what is your view on
how long we

172
00:05:56.436 --> 00:05:57.519
provide advice. What is your view on
how long we might or should stay in

173
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.811
how long we might or should stay in
this kind of lockdown? If you accrue

174
00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:02.477
this kind of lockdown? If you accrue
I think it’s vital not to jump ahead

175
00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:04.102
I think it’s vital not to jump ahead
and try to make predictions which

176
00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:04.477
and try to make predictions which
may be

177
00:06:04.477 --> 00:06:08.186
and try to make predictions which
may he can’t stick to. At the moment

178
00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:10.061
may he can’t stick to. At the moment
it’s clear there are some early

179
00:06:10.061 --> 00:06:10.561
it’s clear there are some earty
signs of the

180
00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:11.144
it’s clear there are some early
signs of the measures taking effect

181
00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:15.602
signs of the measures taking effect
and it’s too early to start pulling

182
00:06:15.602 --> 00:06:16.436
and it’s too earty to start pulling
any of those

183
00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:17.727
and it’s too early to start pulling
any of those measures back. It might

184
00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:18.852
any of those measures back. It might
even be necessary to put extra

185
00:06:18.852 --> 00:06:21.811
even be necessary to put extra
measures in place. If we are not

186
00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:23.811
measures in place. If we are not
driving the rates down hard enough.

187
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:29.102
driving the rates down hard enough.
What kind of measures do you need?

188
00:06:29.102 --> 00:06:29.519
what kind of measures do you need?
At the

189
00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:30.311
What kind of measures do you need?
At the moment, the measures that

190
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:31.894
At the moment, the measures that
have been introduced are not as

191
00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:36.269
have been introduced are not as
extreme as they were in Wuhan, say,

192
00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:38.436
extreme as they were in Wuhan, say,
where they really lock people down

193
00:06:38.436 --> 00:06:39.519
where they really lock people down
absolutely, and nobody was allowed

194
00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:43.019
absolutely, and nobody was allowed
out at all. I am hoping, if the

195
00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:44.394
out at all. I am hoping, if the
measures that have been taken so far

196
00:06:44.394 --> 00:06:47.102
measures that have been taken so far
are sufficient that we can really

197
00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:47.644
are sufficient that we ran really
see a good

198
00:06:47.644 --> 00:06:49.352
are sufficient that we can really
see a good fall in the rates of

199
00:06:49.352 --> 00:06:50.769
see a good fall in the rates of
hospital admissions and subsequent

200
00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:52.727
hospital admissions and subsequent
deaths, then would be the time to

201
00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:55.436
deaths, then would be the time to
start thinking about easing off. But

202
00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.227
start thinking about easing off. But
the other important point that

203
00:06:57.227 --> 00:06:59.727
the other important point that
Mervyn made was that the way we are

204
00:06:59.727 --> 00:07:01.644
Mervyn made was that the way we are
finally going to defeat this is by

205
00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:05.144
finally going to defeat this is by
getting vaccines, and we know that

206
00:07:05.144 --> 00:07:07.936
getting vaccines, and we know that
there are 78 vaccines at various

207
00:07:07.936 --> 00:07:09.519
there are 78 vaccines at various
stages of development, and at least

208
00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:10.894
stages of development, and at least
four in clinical trials, and

209
00:07:10.894 --> 00:07:12.686
four in clinical trials, and
ultimately that will be the way we

210
00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:16.977
ultimately that will be the way we
defeat this, by getting really good

211
00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:21.019
defeat this, by getting really good
vaccines which can then drive this

212
00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:23.061
vaccines which can then drive this
infection away. That is the ultimate

213
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:26.186
infection away. That is the ultimate
hope, but it will take time. We are

214
00:07:26.186 --> 00:07:28.852
hope, but it will take time. We are
all being told that we need to wait

215
00:07:28.852 --> 00:07:30.477
all being told that we need to wait
for the pig, and the peak seems to

216
00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:33.977
for the pig, and the peak seems to
be a moving target. The Chief

217
00:07:33.977 --> 00:07:34.561
be a moving target. The Chief
Scientific Adviser, Patrick

218
00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:35.769
Scientific Adviser, Patrick
Valiance, talked about the peak

219
00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:39.727
Vallance, talked about the peak
likely to be this weekend, that was

220
00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:41.144
likely to be this weekend, that was
back on March the 27th. Today, he

221
00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:41.644
hack on March the 27th. Today, he
was talking

222
00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:43.894
back on March the 27th. Today, he
was talking about we could be weeks

223
00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:46.894
was talking about we could be weeks
from the highest number of deaths.

224
00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:48.477
from the highest number of deaths.
It’s hard to know where we are

225
00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:52.061
It’s hard to know where we are
because it keeps changing. Yes,

226
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:52.394
because it keeps changing. Yes,
well, we

227
00:07:52.394 --> 00:07:52.644
because it keeps changing. Yes,
well, wejust

228
00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:55.644
because it keeps changing. Yes,
well, we just have to observe this.

229
00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:57.644
well, we just have to observe this.
It’s like trying to turn round a

230
00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:57.936
It’s like trying to turn round a
batﬂaship.

231
00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.102
It’s like trying to turn round a
battleship. You can stop the

232
00:07:59.102 --> 00:07:59.269
battleship. You ran stop the
engines,

233
00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.644
battleship. You can stop the
engines, you can put the propellers

234
00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:01.936
engines, you ran put the propellers
into

235
00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:04.352
engines, you can put the propellers
into reverse but it takes time and

236
00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:05.894
into reverse but it takes time and
there is an inherent lack in the

237
00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:07.936
there is an inherent lack in the
system. We have to follow the

238
00:08:07.936 --> 00:08:10.269
system. We have to follow the
science and the facts and we mustn’t

239
00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:11.561
science and the facts and we mustn’t
jump ahead and trying dissipate too

240
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:15.436
jump ahead and trying dissipate too
much. --

00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:16.602
jump ahead and trying dissipate too
much. —— there is an inherent lag in

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:22.227
the system. The majority of people
have been great at following the

246
00:08:22.227 --> 00:08:24.102
have been great at following the
guidelines but continue to do that

247
00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:25.269
guidelines but continue to do that
is a really important part, not

248
00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:27.227
is a really important part, not
giving up on what we have achieved

249
00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:28.477
giving up on what we have achieved
so far but keeping going and

250
00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:30.686
so far but keeping going and
following those guidelines will be

251
00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:32.686
following those guidelines will be
an important part of making sure we

252
00:08:32.686 --> 00:08:34.019
an important part of making sure we
have enough control over the virus

253
00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:36.436
have enough control over the virus
to get to the other side of it and

254
00:08:36.436 --> 00:08:37.852
to get to the other side of it and
give the NHS the capacity and time

255
00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:40.477
give the NHS the capacity and time
to cope. If you don’t see the kind

256
00:08:40.477 --> 00:08:42.311
to cope. If you don’t see the kind
of behaviour you want

257
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:43.019
to cope. If you don’t see the kind
of behaviour you went over Easter,

258
00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:43.686
of behaviour you want over Easter,
peopla

259
00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:44.602
of behaviour you went over Easter,
people staying at home, are further

260
00:08:44.602 --> 00:08:47.977
people staying at home, are further
measures on the cards? We have

261
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:50.144
measures on the cards? We have
really good measures in place and

262
00:08:50.144 --> 00:08:51.477
really good measures in place and
people are generally following them

263
00:08:51.477 --> 00:08:53.102
people are generally following them
and I’d stress the importance of

264
00:08:53.102 --> 00:08:55.061
and I’d stress the importance of
continuing to do it even over a

265
00:08:55.061 --> 00:08:56.269
continuing to do it even over a
weekend where it might be tempting

266
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.477
weekend where it might be tempting
to try and do something different.

267
00:08:58.477 --> 00:08:59.686
to try and do something different.
Every time somebody stays home and

268
00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:01.394
Every time somebody stays home and
follows the guidelines this weekend

269
00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:03.394
follows the guidelines this weekend
all of us as a country are playing

270
00:09:03.394 --> 00:09:04.811
all of us as a country are playing
our part in saving lives and helping

271
00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:10.394
our part in saving lives and helping
the NHS. Mike Hadley has sent in a

272
00:09:10.394 --> 00:09:12.144
the NHS. Mike Hadley has sent in a
message saying, could the government

273
00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:14.352
message saying, could the government
clarify the law on exercise to

274
00:09:14.352 --> 00:09:17.686
clarify the law on exercise to
resolve the confusion over guidance?

275
00:09:17.686 --> 00:09:19.186
resolve the confusion over guidance?
I was saddened yesterday, he says,

276
00:09:19.186 --> 00:09:21.227
I was saddened yesterday, he says,
to see an interview with a woman who

277
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.561
to see an interview with a woman who
said she couldn’t take her child to

278
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.936
said she couldn’t take her child to
the park because she couldn’t get

279
00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:26.894
the park because she couldn’t get
there and back in 30 minutes. She

280
00:09:26.894 --> 00:09:31.227
there and back in 30 minutes. She
isn’t restricted to 30 minutes, she?

281
00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:31.811
isn’t restricted to 30 minutes, she?
No, peopla

282
00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:32.644
isn’t restricted to 30 minutes, she?
No, people should go and get

283
00:09:32.644 --> 00:09:36.186
No, people should go and get
exercise once a day. What people

284
00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:37.227
exercise once a day. What people
shouldn’t do, and as somebody

285
00:09:37.227 --> 00:09:41.019
shouldn’t do, and as somebody
representing a seaside resort,

286
00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:43.061
representing a seaside resort,
people shouldn’t get in a car to

287
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:43.186
peopla shouldn’t get in a far to
travel

288
00:09:43.186 --> 00:09:46.644
people shouldn’t get in a car to
travel somewhere to exercise. They

289
00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:48.144
travel somewhere to exercise. They
should take exercise around and from

290
00:09:48.144 --> 00:09:49.352
should take exercise around and from
where they live, doing it sensibly

291
00:09:49.352 --> 00:09:52.561
where they live, doing it sensibly
and following social distancing. It

292
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:54.102
and following social distancing. It
is good and important for mental and

293
00:09:54.102 --> 00:09:56.769
is good and important for mental and
physical health to get exercise but

294
00:09:56.769 --> 00:09:58.436
physical health to get exercise but
to do it in a sensible and conscious

295
00:09:58.436 --> 00:10:03.269
to do it in a sensible and conscious
way. Plan, let’s come back to the

296
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.186
way. Plan, let’s come back to the
question, which is about how we get

297
00:10:06.186 --> 00:10:08.269
question, which is about how we get
out of this, what measures can we

298
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.644
out of this, what measures ran we
introduce, do

299
00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:10.561
out of this, what measures can we
introduce, do we turn them on and

300
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:10.852
introduce, do we turn them on and
off.

301
00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:11.602
introduce, do we turn them on and
off, which businesses might reopen

302
00:10:11.602 --> 00:10:14.477
off, which businesses might reopen
first? What is a safe way of doing

303
00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:14.602
first? what is a safe way of doing
this?

304
00:10:14.602 --> 00:10:19.019
first? What is a safe way of doing
this? What is the Labour view? I

305
00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:20.061
this? what is the labour view? I
agree with

306
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:21.186
this? What is the Labour view? I
agree with what Brendan has said

307
00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:22.477
agree with what Brendan has said
about our behaviours at the moment,

308
00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:24.644
about our behaviours at the moment,
and the majority of people are doing

309
00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:24.977
and the majority of peopla are doing
the right

310
00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:27.102
and the majority of people are doing
the right thing but the more we do

311
00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:29.936
the right thing but the more we do
that, the quicker we will be able to

312
00:10:29.936 --> 00:10:31.519
that, the quicker we will be able to
come out of that lockdown, so it is

313
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.936
come out of that lockdown, so it is
in all of our interests that we

314
00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:35.852
in all of our interests that we
observe the rules. But I think it’s

315
00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:36.186
observe the mles. But I think it’s
important not

316
00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:37.894
observe the rules. But I think it’s
important not to put a date, of

317
00:10:37.894 --> 00:10:40.269
important not to put a date, of
course not, we don’t need a date,

318
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.061
course not, we don’t need a date,
and it wouldn’t be possible, but we

319
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:43.352
and it wouldn’t be possible, but we
need to start to have some

320
00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:45.061
need to start to have some
clarification of what circumstances

321
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.561
clarification of what circumstances
would allow us to relax some of

322
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:52.936
would allow us to relax some of
these rules and conditions and

323
00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:54.644
these rules and conditions and
closures and how you would go about

324
00:10:54.644 --> 00:10:57.144
closures and how you would go about
doing that, so what would be needed

325
00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:58.352
doing that, so what would be needed
in terms of testing, not

326
00:10:58.352 --> 00:10:59.144
doing that, so what would be needed
in terms of testing, notjust a test

327
00:10:59.144 --> 00:11:01.436
in terms of testing, not just a test
to show

328
00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:02.894
in terms of testing, notjust a test
to show whether we have coronavirus

329
00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:05.061
to show whether we have coronavirus
at the moment. Those tests need to

330
00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:07.102
at the moment. Those tests need to
increase sharply to meet the

331
00:11:07.102 --> 00:11:08.019
increase sharply to meet the
government targets, but auto should

332
00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:09.602
government targets, but auto should
the tests to show if you have ever

333
00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:12.894
the tests to show if you have ever
had it so if you have any immunity

334
00:11:12.894 --> 00:11:14.894
had it so if you have any immunity
to it, and that along with contact

335
00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:16.477
to it, and that along with contact
tracing so we know you have been in

336
00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:19.352
tracing so we know you have been in
contact with in the period of time

337
00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:20.686
contact with in the period of time
you have had coronavirus, those are

338
00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:21.811
you have had coronavims, those are
the sorts of

339
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:22.686
you have had coronavirus, those are
the sorts of measures that countries

340
00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:23.894
the sorts of measures that countries
like South Korea and Singapore and

341
00:11:23.894 --> 00:11:26.561
like South Korea and Singapore and
Germany are looking at, and what

342
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.852
Germany are looking at, and what
Keir Starmer has clearly said is

343
00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:28.186
Keir Starmer has dearty said is
that he

344
00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:30.102
Keir Starmer has clearly said is
that he would like to see the

345
00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:32.852
that he would like to see the
government publishing their plans

346
00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:36.644
government publishing their plans
for ending the lockdown not the

347
00:11:36.644 --> 00:11:39.061
for ending the lockdown not the
dates. We know that isn’t possible,

348
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:40.227
dates. We know that isn’t possible,
but the circumstances in which the

349
00:11:40.227 --> 00:11:41.686
but the circumstances in which the
lockdown would come to an end and

350
00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:42.936
lockdown would come to an end and
how the government go about ending

351
00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:45.977
how the government go about ending
it. That is what we are looking for

352
00:11:45.977 --> 00:11:48.019
it. That is what we are looking for
from the government and I think that

353
00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:49.144
from the government and I think that
is what people are looking for,

354
00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:50.227
is what peopla are looking for,
greater

355
00:11:50.227 --> 00:11:51.394
is what people are looking for,
greater clarity about the

356
00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:55.144
greater clarity about the
circumstances. Is it possible that

357
00:11:55.144 --> 00:11:55.602
circumstances. Is it possibla that
nobody ran

358
00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:56.561
circumstances. Is it possible that
nobody can really know that at this

359
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:58.852
nobody ran really know that at this
stage?

360
00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:00.894
nobody can really know that at this
stage? Nobody knows the date of this

361
00:12:00.894 --> 00:12:01.477
stage? Nobody knows the date of this
ran edit, but

362
00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:03.686
stage? Nobody knows the date of this
can edit, but we that, at some

363
00:12:03.686 --> 00:12:04.144
ran edit, but we that, at some
point, these

364
00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:05.977
can edit, but we that, at some
point, these restrictions on our

365
00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:11.144
point, these restrictions on our
lives will be lifted. But how does

366
00:12:11.144 --> 00:12:11.936
lives will be lifted. But how does
the government envisage that

367
00:12:11.936 --> 00:12:15.019
the government envisage that
happening? Will it be when the

368
00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:15.102
happening? will it be when the
number,

369
00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:16.102
happening? Will it be when the
number, when we have testing that

370
00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:19.311
number, when we have testing that
shows that there is only a certain

371
00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:21.894
shows that there is only a certain
number of cases detected every day

372
00:12:21.894 --> 00:12:23.769
number of cases detected every day
and we are confident that is all of

373
00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:24.186
and we are confident that is all of
the rases

374
00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:25.894
and we are confident that is all of
the cases that are emerging because

375
00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:26.436
the rases that are emerging because
we are doing

376
00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:28.144
the cases that are emerging because
we are doing testing on a mass

377
00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:29.686
we are doing testing on a mass
level, but also that we have the

378
00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:31.144
level, but also that we have the
technology or the resources to put

379
00:12:31.144 --> 00:12:35.227
technology or the resources to put
into the contact tracing, to have a

380
00:12:35.227 --> 00:12:36.477
into the contact tracing, to have a
technology base, so we know through

381
00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:38.144
technology base, so we know through
our smartphone who have been near

382
00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:41.436
our smartphone who have been near
to? It’s that sort of information

383
00:12:41.436 --> 00:12:42.561
to? It’s that sort of information
that the government might need to

384
00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:45.061
that the government might need to
start thinking about now so that,

385
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.019
start thinking about now so that,
when we are in that position, the

386
00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:48.852
when we are in that position, the
government are able to relax the

387
00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:49.269
government are able to relax the
mles to

388
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.061
government are able to relax the
rules to protect lives but also to

389
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:52.186
mles to protect lives but also to
protect

390
00:12:52.186 --> 00:12:53.436
rules to protect lives but also to
protect livelihoods. There are many

391
00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:54.811
protect livelihoods. There are many
people at the moment who are really

392
00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:55.144
people at the moment who are really
stmggling

393
00:12:55.144 --> 00:12:55.686
people at the moment who are really
struggling financially because they

394
00:12:55.686 --> 00:12:56.144
stmggling financially because they
can’t get

395
00:12:56.144 --> 00:12:58.019
struggling financially because they
can’t get out to work to pay the

396
00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:00.019
can’t get out to work to pay the
bills and put food on the table.

397
00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:02.102
bills and put food on the table.
There are businesses that have had

398
00:13:02.102 --> 00:13:02.394
There are businesses that have had
to dose

399
00:13:02.394 --> 00:13:03.561
There are businesses that have had
to close and are worried they won’t

400
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:04.644
to dose and are worried they won’t
be able to open

401
00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:05.227
to close and are worried they won’t
be able to open again. I think

402
00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:06.852
be able to open again. I think
that’s the clarification people are

403
00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:07.186
that’s the clarification peopla are
looking for

404
00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:08.227
that’s the clarification people are
looking for and we are pushing for

405
00:13:08.227 --> 00:13:12.519
looking for and we are pushing for
the government to publish. The big

406
00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.561
the government to publish. The big
downside of a lockdown is that for

407
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:15.061
downside of a lockdown is that for
some peopla

408
00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:16.436
downside of a lockdown is that for
some people it’s punishing not only

409
00:13:16.436 --> 00:13:16.602
some peopla it’s punishing not only
economically

410
00:13:16.602 --> 00:13:17.644
some people it’s punishing not only
economically but in terms of the

411
00:13:17.644 --> 00:13:20.686
economically but in terms of the
situation they live in. Custom yes,

412
00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:22.102
situation they live in. Custom yes,
and I think it’s quite appropriate

413
00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:25.977
and I think it’s quite appropriate
for you to use the word punishing.

414
00:13:25.977 --> 00:13:28.269
for you to use the word punishing.
We have to look at the ulterior to

415
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:32.519
We have to look at the ulterior to
the demand to return back to

416
00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.311
the demand to return back to
normality. People, especially those

417
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:37.019
normality. People, especially those
down the social scale. We have been

418
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:37.561
down the social sale. We have been
living in an

419
00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:38.269
down the social scale. We have been
living in an iteration of the UK

420
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:39.644
living in an iteration of the UK
which has become increasingly

421
00:13:39.644 --> 00:13:44.144
which has become increasingly
punitive for workers in precarious

422
00:13:44.144 --> 00:13:45.436
punitive for workers in precarious
jobs, lower class children in

423
00:13:45.436 --> 00:13:48.061
jobs, lower class children in
schools, people who rent

424
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.269
schools, people who rent
accommodation, so if you explore why

425
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:50.394
accommodation, so if you explore why
many peopla

426
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:51.644
accommodation, so if you explore why
many people are so keen to return to

427
00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:52.061
many peopla are so keen to return to
work and

428
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:53.686
many people are so keen to return to
work and they might flout the rules,

429
00:13:53.686 --> 00:13:54.227
work and they might ﬂout the mles,
many of them,

430
00:13:54.227 --> 00:13:55.102
work and they might flout the rules,
many of them, it’s because they have

431
00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:57.477
many of them, it’s because they have
a fear they are going to suffer in

432
00:13:57.477 --> 00:13:59.102
a fear they are going to suffer in
some way or they are going to be

433
00:13:59.102 --> 00:13:59.769
some way or they are going to be
punished or reprimanded, because

434
00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:02.727
punished or reprimanded, because
that is what their experience tells

435
00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:04.561
that is what their experience tells
them about the society they live in.

436
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:06.686
them about the society they live in.
I commend the government ministers

437
00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:09.311
I commend the government ministers
for this real shift in language and

438
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:12.561
for this real shift in language and
emphasising not the things that are

439
00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:14.894
emphasising not the things that are
deserving and undeserving about us,

440
00:14:14.894 --> 00:14:17.394
deserving and undeserving about us,
but actually this talk of

441
00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:18.602
but actually this talk of
togetherness, the idea that society

442
00:14:18.602 --> 00:14:20.394
togetherness, the idea that society
is a ship and we are only steering

443
00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:23.144
is a ship and we are only steering
as safely as the most vulnerable

444
00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:27.061
as safely as the most vulnerable
people on it, that we have got

445
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:29.977
people on it, that we have got
homeless people now been put into

446
00:14:29.977 --> 00:14:32.186
homeless people now been put into
accommodation. Suddenly, society is

447
00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:33.477
accommodation. Suddenly, society is
vulnerable because we have so many

448
00:14:33.477 --> 00:14:34.936
vulnerable because we have so many
vulnerable people. I

449
00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:35.394
vulnerable because we have so many
vulnerable people. Ifeel

450
00:14:35.394 --> 00:14:35.644
vulnerable because we have so many
vulnerable people. I feel that

451
00:14:35.644 --> 00:14:35.852
vulnerable because we have so many
vulnerable people. Ifeel that that

452
00:14:35.852 --> 00:14:36.144
vulnerable peopla. Ifeel that that
sort of

453
00:14:36.144 --> 00:14:38.102
vulnerable people. Ifeel that that
sort of language and that shift in

454
00:14:38.102 --> 00:14:40.144
sort of language and that shift in
tone, which really does set the

455
00:14:40.144 --> 00:14:41.686
tone, which really does set the
tone, when you think about the

456
00:14:41.686 --> 00:14:44.186
tone, when you think about the
amount of goodwill which has been

457
00:14:44.186 --> 00:14:45.102
amount of goodwill which has been
unleashed, 1 million volunteers

458
00:14:45.102 --> 00:14:48.061
unleashed, 1 million volunteers
signing up to help the NHS deliver

459
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:49.102
signing up to help the NHS deliver
stuff to the elderly, politicians

460
00:14:49.102 --> 00:14:49.186
stuff to the elderty, politicians
ran

461
00:14:49.186 --> 00:14:49.477
stuff to the elderly, politicians
ran really

462
00:14:49.477 --> 00:14:50.436
stuff to the elderly, politicians
can really make a difference. I

463
00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:50.644
ran really make a difference. I
think

464
00:14:50.644 --> 00:14:54.227
can really make a difference. I
think this needs to extent, the

465
00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.352
think this needs to extent, the
rhetoric, people need to be told

466
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.144
rhetoric, people need to be told
they are not going to be punished,

467
00:14:57.144 --> 00:14:59.227
they are not going to be punished,
they are not going to suffer

468
00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:00.061
they are not going to suffer
unnecessarily, and that ultimately

469
00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:01.936
unnecessarily, and that ultimately
this is not a pretext for austerity

470
00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:04.102
this is not a pretext for austerity
2.0. If government

471
00:15:04.102 --> 00:15:05.186
this is not a pretext for austerity
2.0. If government ministers bring

472
00:15:05.186 --> 00:15:08.352
2.0. If government ministers bring
into their awareness those sort of

473
00:15:08.352 --> 00:15:09.144
into their awareness those sort of
anxieties, that conditioning about

474
00:15:09.144 --> 00:15:11.894
anxieties, that conditioning about
being punished or kept out of your

475
00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:15.061
being punished or kept out of your
ﬂat or excluded from school and

476
00:15:15.061 --> 00:15:15.477
ﬂat or excluded from school and
begin to

477
00:15:15.477 --> 00:15:16.561
flat or excluded from school and
begin to reflect that in their

478
00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:16.769
begin to reﬂect that in their
rhetoric,

479
00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:18.311
begin to reflect that in their
rhetoric, people might become better

480
00:15:18.311 --> 00:15:20.769
rhetoric, people might become better
adjusted to this very necessary and

481
00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:23.686
adjusted to this very necessary and
prolonged period of ultimately

482
00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:28.769
prolonged period of ultimately
isolation at home. Can I ask Peter,

483
00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:31.102
isolation at home. (“an I ask Peter,
what does

484
00:15:31.102 --> 00:15:32.894
isolation at home. Can I ask Peter,
what does the peak and the point at

485
00:15:32.894 --> 00:15:34.477
what does the peak and the point at
which we might begin to ease off the

486
00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:38.436
which we might begin to ease off the
lockdown look like? We have heard in

487
00:15:38.436 --> 00:15:39.977
lockdown look like? We have heard in
Italy they are talking about a

488
00:15:39.977 --> 00:15:41.352
Italy they are talking about a
certain number of days, a plateau of

489
00:15:41.352 --> 00:15:43.519
certain number of days, a plateau of
a number of deaths, and they are

490
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:44.602
a number of deaths, and they are
beginning to think about when they

491
00:15:44.602 --> 00:15:46.769
beginning to think about when they
might ease the lockdown. With all

492
00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:47.186
might ease the lockdown. with all
the

493
00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:47.811
might ease the lockdown. With all
the work

494
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:48.019
might ease the lockdown. with all
the work you

495
00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:48.936
might ease the lockdown. With all
the work you have done on viral

496
00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:50.144
the work you have done on viral
threats, what does it actually look

497
00:15:50.144 --> 00:15:54.227
threats, what does it actually look
like? You often only know you have

498
00:15:54.227 --> 00:15:56.102
like? You often only know you have
reached the peak when you pass it,

499
00:15:56.102 --> 00:15:56.852
reached the peak when you pass it,
so you ran look

500
00:15:56.852 --> 00:15:59.811
reached the peak when you pass it,
so you can look back and see that

501
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:00.227
so you ran look back and see that
things are

502
00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:01.186
so you can look back and see that
things are declining. We don’t want

503
00:16:01.186 --> 00:16:02.394
things are declining. We don’t want
to take their brakes off completely

504
00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:03.811
to take their brakes off completely
at that point. The point was being

505
00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:06.977
at that point. The point was being
made about the value of testing and

506
00:16:06.977 --> 00:16:11.144
made about the value of testing and
the following up contacts when there

507
00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:12.352
the following up contacts when there
are relatively few cases, which is

508
00:16:12.352 --> 00:16:12.519
are relatively few rases, which is
really

509
00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:15.186
are relatively few cases, which is
really important. It becomes

510
00:16:15.186 --> 00:16:16.269
really important. It becomes
incredibly important to have good

511
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:17.811
incredibly important to have good
tests and a good way of following up

512
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.477
tests and a good way of following up
those contacts so you can really

513
00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:19.811
those contacts so you ran really
isolate

514
00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:22.894
those contacts so you can really
isolate pockets of infection as the

515
00:16:22.894 --> 00:16:26.894
isolate pockets of infection as the
numbers come down the other side.

516
00:16:26.894 --> 00:16:28.811
numbers come down the other side.
Plan, are we talking may be if you

517
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:32.311
Plan, are we talking may be if you
had a plateau of a of deaths for a

518
00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:35.727
had a plateau of a of deaths for a
week? What are we aiming for?

519
00:16:35.727 --> 00:16:36.186
week? what are we aiming for?
Clearty, just

520
00:16:36.186 --> 00:16:38.727
week? What are we aiming for?
Clearly, just as it takes time to

521
00:16:38.727 --> 00:16:39.186
Clearty, just as it takes time to
slow down,

522
00:16:39.186 --> 00:16:40.852
Clearly, just as it takes time to
slow down, it takes time to speed up

523
00:16:40.852 --> 00:16:42.769
slow down, it takes time to speed up
again so, as you take the brakes

524
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.977
again so, as you take the brakes
off.

525
00:16:42.977 --> 00:16:44.436
again so, as you take the brakes
off, you don’t see an immediate

526
00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:44.644
off, you don’t see an immediate
jump.

527
00:16:44.644 --> 00:16:47.269
off, you don’t see an immediate
jump, and it will take time for the

528
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:50.852
jump, and it will take time for the
effects of easing to show up in the

529
00:16:50.852 --> 00:16:51.311
effects of easing to show up in the
statistic,

530
00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:54.186
effects of easing to show up in the
statistics, so the whole thing is

531
00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:54.477
statistic, so the whola thing is
quite a

532
00:16:54.477 --> 00:16:59.936
statistics, so the whole thing is
quite a difficult trip. It’s like

533
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.852
quite a difficult trip. It’s like
using the clutch going when you’re

534
00:17:01.852 --> 00:17:03.269
using the clutch going when you’re
trying to steer this thing get the

535
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:09.436
trying to steer this thing get the
right amount of easement. Dan, ——

536
00:17:09.436 --> 00:17:10.102
right amount of easement. Dan, --
Darren, you look

537
00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:14.311
right amount of easement. Dan, ——
Darren, you look frustrated. No, I

538
00:17:14.311 --> 00:17:14.436
Darren, you look fmstrated. No, I
wasn’t

539
00:17:14.436 --> 00:17:16.644
Darren, you look frustrated. No, I
wasn’t frustrated. I’ve just been

540
00:17:16.644 --> 00:17:18.436
wasn’t frustrated. I’ve just been
informed this is life so I was

541
00:17:18.436 --> 00:17:20.436
informed this is life so I was
actually more disorientated. That

542
00:17:20.436 --> 00:17:23.727
actually more disorientated. That
was my expression. And, you didn’t

543
00:17:23.727 --> 00:17:26.227
was my expression. And, you didn’t
know we were live. I apologise. You

544
00:17:26.227 --> 00:17:28.644
know we were live. I apologise. You
are doing fine so far. And, don’t

545
00:17:28.644 --> 00:17:31.102
are doing fine so far. And, don’t
worry. Let me read you some other

546
00:17:31.102 --> 00:17:36.019
worry. Let me read you some other
messages. Simon tailor, we have a

547
00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:37.227
messages. Simon tailor, we have a
soft lockdown compared to other

548
00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:38.352
soft lockdown compared to other
countries so why are we even

549
00:17:38.352 --> 00:17:40.227
countries so why are we even
considering lifting it when we have

550
00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:41.561
considering lifting it when we have
the second highest death rate in the

551
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.977
the second highest death rate in the
world yesterday somebody who calls

552
00:17:43.977 --> 00:17:47.019
world yesterday somebody who calls
himself only needles, no comment,

553
00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.811
himself only needles, no comment,
why when the country is in lockdown

554
00:17:48.811 --> 00:17:51.394
why when the country is in lockdown
are there still thousands of people

555
00:17:51.394 --> 00:17:52.102
are there still thousands of peopla
arriving on

556
00:17:52.102 --> 00:17:54.102
are there still thousands of people
arriving on flights every day from

557
00:17:54.102 --> 00:17:54.269
arriving on ﬂights every day from
various

558
00:17:54.269 --> 00:17:54.811
arriving on flights every day from
various coronavirus hotspots without

559
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:57.227
various coronavirus hotspots without
any checks on arrival? Another

560
00:17:57.227 --> 00:18:02.436
any checks on arrival? Another
question I would like to go to, from

561
00:18:02.436 --> 00:18:06.811
question I would like to go to, from
julia stable. I am

562
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:07.394
question I would like to go to, from
Julia stable. I am an Italian

563
00:18:07.394 --> 00:18:09.019
Julia stable. I am an Italian
national in the UK. In the last two

564
00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:10.644
national in the UK. In the last two
weeks I have been following the

565
00:18:10.644 --> 00:18:11.811
weeks I have been following the
situation here and in my home

566
00:18:11.811 --> 00:18:15.936
situation here and in my home
country for the many Italians living

567
00:18:15.936 --> 00:18:18.019
country for the many Italians living
here that I know, myself included,

568
00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:19.102
here that I know, myself included,
were wondering how much of the

569
00:18:19.102 --> 00:18:21.519
were wondering how much of the
current UK measures have been

570
00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:22.727
current UK measures have been
informed by what was learned in

571
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:27.311
informed by what was learned in
Italy. Brandon, we have looked at

572
00:18:27.311 --> 00:18:30.102
Italy. Brandon, we have looked at
the figures coming out of Italy

573
00:18:30.102 --> 00:18:33.936
the figures coming out of Italy
with, I mean, open mouths in horror,

574
00:18:33.936 --> 00:18:34.602
with, I mean, open mouths in horror,
certainly eartier on,

575
00:18:34.602 --> 00:18:35.186
with, I mean, open mouths in horror,
certainly earlier on, and our death

576
00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:35.811
certainly eartier on, and our death
toll is not

577
00:18:35.811 --> 00:18:36.811
certainly earlier on, and our death
toll is not far behind. What lessons

578
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:37.311
toll is not far behind. what lassons
is the

579
00:18:37.311 --> 00:18:40.769
toll is not far behind. What lessons
is the government learning?

580
00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:42.019
is the government learning?
Customers I think one thing which

581
00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:43.894
Customers I think one thing which
was really quite striking, and cut

582
00:18:43.894 --> 00:18:49.102
was really quite striking, and cut
through a

583
00:18:55.977 --> 00:19:01.644
Image, it was clear from what we
were seeing in the hospitals. Our

584
00:19:01.644 --> 00:19:03.102
were seeing in the hospitals. Our
experts are talking to theirs and we

585
00:19:03.102 --> 00:19:04.311
experts are talking to theirs and we
are talking to people around the

586
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:05.977
are talking to peopla around the
world.

587
00:19:05.977 --> 00:19:06.977
are talking to people around the
world. The Chief Medical Officer and

588
00:19:06.977 --> 00:19:10.477
world. The Chief Medical Officer and
Chief Scientific advisor and their

589
00:19:10.477 --> 00:19:11.769
Chief Scientific advisor and their
teams have been looking at what’s

590
00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:14.144
teams have been looking at what’s
happening around the world, talking

591
00:19:14.144 --> 00:19:17.061
happening around the world, talking
to other countries. One thing I was

592
00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:18.644
to other countries. One thing I was
talking about earlier today, this

593
00:19:18.644 --> 00:19:18.936
talking about eartier today, this
week

594
00:19:18.936 --> 00:19:20.144
talking about earlier today, this
week we have seen a memorandum of

595
00:19:20.144 --> 00:19:23.269
week we have seen a memorandum of
understanding between Northern

596
00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:25.311
understanding between Northern
Ireland and the Republic, to make

597
00:19:25.311 --> 00:19:26.477
Ireland and the Republic, to make
sure we are sharing experiences and

598
00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:30.019
sure we are sharing experiences and
ideas. But Brandon, talking about

599
00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:31.686
ideas. But Brandon, talking about
Italy, we all looked at what’s been

600
00:19:31.686 --> 00:19:35.269
Italy, we all looked at what’s been
happening there. Hang on. Just

601
00:19:35.269 --> 00:19:35.477
happening there. Hang on. just
responding

602
00:19:35.477 --> 00:19:35.686
happening there. Hang on. Just
responding to

603
00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:36.769
happening there. Hang on. Just
responding toJulia’s question. Our

604
00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:37.936
responding to julia’s question. Our
death

605
00:19:37.936 --> 00:19:40.852
responding toJulia’s question. Our
death rate is approaching that of

606
00:19:40.852 --> 00:19:47.061
death rate is approaching that of
Italy. Their highest death toll

607
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.561
Italy. Their highest death toll
yesterday. Should we have been doing

608
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:49.061
yesterday. Should we have been doing
things eartier

609
00:19:49.061 --> 00:19:50.227
yesterday. Should we have been doing
things earlier not to be in that

610
00:19:50.227 --> 00:19:51.477
things eartier not to be in that
position? At

611
00:19:51.477 --> 00:19:53.852
things earlier not to be in that
position? At all times we have taken

612
00:19:53.852 --> 00:19:54.852
position? At all times we have taken
the medical and scientific advice

613
00:19:54.852 --> 00:19:56.686
the medical and scientific advice
around what we think is the correct

614
00:19:56.686 --> 00:20:01.561
around what we think is the correct
and appropriate response for the UK.

615
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:03.102
and appropriate response for the UK.
Some countries are using different

616
00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:05.477
Some countries are using different
approaches in different regions of

617
00:20:05.477 --> 00:20:06.519
approaches in different regions of
the country. It’s not entirely

618
00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:09.061
the country. It’s not entirely
straightforward. Other experts will

619
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:11.269
straightforward. Other experts will
give a view on that but it’s not

620
00:20:11.269 --> 00:20:12.519
give a view on that but it’s not
straightforward to do a direct

621
00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:14.102
straightforward to do a direct
comparison from country to country

622
00:20:14.102 --> 00:20:15.269
comparison from country to country
but we’ve taken advice about the

623
00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:17.936
but we’ve taken advice about the
right thing to do at the right time.

624
00:20:17.936 --> 00:20:20.394
right thing to do at the right time.
This comes back to the previous

625
00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:22.644
This comes back to the previous
question, why we’ve got to be

626
00:20:22.644 --> 00:20:24.061
question, why we’ve got to be
cautious about looking too far into

627
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:25.894
cautious about looking too far into
the future when we have to make sure

628
00:20:25.894 --> 00:20:27.436
the future when we have to make sure
we are following the guidelines

629
00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:29.186
we are following the guidelines
today. This question isn’t

630
00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.102
today. This question isn’t
necessarily about looking at the

631
00:20:31.102 --> 00:20:32.936
necessarily about looking at the
future but looking back. Peter, you

632
00:20:32.936 --> 00:20:34.644
future but looking back. Peter, you
won of the people advising the

633
00:20:34.644 --> 00:20:35.811
won of the people advising the
government. What lessons can we

634
00:20:35.811 --> 00:20:36.144
government. what lessons ran we
learn

635
00:20:36.144 --> 00:20:38.727
government. What lessons can we
learn from Italy, or have we learnt

636
00:20:38.727 --> 00:20:39.936
learn from Italy, or have we learnt
lessons? We’ve learnt an

637
00:20:39.936 --> 00:20:40.227
learn from Italy, or have we learnt
lessons? We’ve learnt an amazing

638
00:20:40.227 --> 00:20:43.102
lessons? We’ve learnt an amazing
amount, not only from our colleagues

639
00:20:43.102 --> 00:20:45.602
amount, not only from our colleagues
in Italy but also from China. Right

640
00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:46.102
in Italy but also from China. Right
from the

641
00:20:46.102 --> 00:20:49.102
in Italy but also from China. Right
from the beginning, the Chinese have

642
00:20:49.102 --> 00:20:51.061
from the beginning, the Chinese have
been incredibly quick to help us by

643
00:20:51.061 --> 00:20:54.561
been incredibly quick to help us by
telling us what they’ve tried, what

644
00:20:54.561 --> 00:20:55.852
telling us what therve tried, what
therve

645
00:20:55.852 --> 00:20:57.519
telling us what they’ve tried, what
they’ve found to be advantageous and

646
00:20:57.519 --> 00:20:58.644
they’ve found to be advantageous and
disadvantageous. They’ve also been

647
00:20:58.644 --> 00:20:59.227
disadvantageous. Therve also been
very quick to

648
00:20:59.227 --> 00:21:00.519
disadvantageous. They’ve also been
very quick to publish a lot of data

649
00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:03.852
very quick to publish a lot of data
on the management. I would

650
00:21:03.852 --> 00:21:07.644
on the management. I would
absolutely give credit to the

651
00:21:07.644 --> 00:21:08.727
absolutely give credit to the
Chinese for their generosity,

652
00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.102
Chinese for their generosity,
actually, with all the information

653
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:10.352
actually, with all the information
therve

654
00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:13.102
actually, with all the information
they’ve given us. And also, the more

655
00:21:13.102 --> 00:21:14.686
therve given us. And also, the more
we slow

656
00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:16.644
they’ve given us. And also, the more
we slow down this epidemic, the more

657
00:21:16.644 --> 00:21:17.519
we slow down this epidemic, the more
we ran learn,

658
00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:18.602
we slow down this epidemic, the more
we can learn, and more trials can be

659
00:21:18.602 --> 00:21:20.102
we ran learn, and more trials ran be
done. At the

660
00:21:20.102 --> 00:21:21.102
we can learn, and more trials can be
done. At the moment there are

661
00:21:21.102 --> 00:21:23.311
done. At the moment there are
literally hundreds of trials going

662
00:21:23.311 --> 00:21:24.519
literally hundreds of trials going
on, different approaches to

663
00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:26.186
on, different approaches to
treatment, many of which are

664
00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:27.977
treatment, many of which are
starting to look quite interesting

665
00:21:27.977 --> 00:21:29.977
starting to look quite interesting
and promising. Coming back to Italy,

666
00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:30.519
and promising. Coming backto Italy,
they tried a

667
00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:36.102
and promising. Coming back to Italy,
they tried a drug that

668
00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:41.769
they tried a drug that blocks a

669
00:21:41.977 --> 00:21:42.144
they tried a dmg that blocks a
particular

670
00:21:42.144 --> 00:21:42.769
they tried a drug that blocks a
particular element and these

671
00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:45.227
particular element and these
uncontrolled trials looked like they

672
00:21:45.227 --> 00:21:45.727
uncontrollad trials looked like they
had amazing

673
00:21:45.727 --> 00:21:48.477
uncontrolled trials looked like they
had amazing effects on people with

674
00:21:48.477 --> 00:21:50.102
had amazing effects on people with
advanced disease, so this has been

675
00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:53.936
advanced disease, so this has been
put to proper trial in a controlled

676
00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.769
put to proper trial in a controlled
way, with placebos and other drugs.

677
00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:58.186
way, with placebos and other drugs.
We are learning so much

678
00:21:58.186 --> 00:21:59.727
We are learning so much
scientifically about how this

679
00:21:59.727 --> 00:22:01.686
scientifically about how this
epidemic is unfolding. Can I

680
00:22:01.686 --> 00:22:01.936
scientifically about how this
epidemic is unfolding. Can Ijust

681
00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:05.102
epidemic is unfolding. (“an Ijust
ask you,

682
00:22:05.102 --> 00:22:06.519
epidemic is unfolding. Can Ijust
ask you, Peter, we are minding your

683
00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:08.436
ask you, Peter, we are minding your
experience since we have you. Italy

684
00:22:08.436 --> 00:22:11.686
experience since we have you. Italy
went into lockdown earlier than us.

685
00:22:11.686 --> 00:22:12.102
went into lockdown eartier than us.
I was

686
00:22:12.102 --> 00:22:13.186
went into lockdown earlier than us.
I was struck

687
00:22:13.186 --> 00:22:13.352
went into lockdown eartier than us.
I was stmck by

688
00:22:13.352 --> 00:22:13.977
went into lockdown earlier than us.
I was struck by the press conference

689
00:22:13.977 --> 00:22:14.352
I was stmck by the press conference
today, Dominic

690
00:22:14.352 --> 00:22:16.186
I was struck by the press conference
today, Dominic Raab saying that the

691
00:22:16.186 --> 00:22:19.477
today, Dominic Raab saying that the
lockdown is working, that it has

692
00:22:19.477 --> 00:22:21.811
lockdown is working, that it has
worked and is working, it is saving

693
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:24.186
worked and is working, it is saving
lives. It begs the question, should

694
00:22:24.186 --> 00:22:25.852
lives. It begs the question, should
we have done it earlier and

695
00:22:25.852 --> 00:22:28.519
we have done it earlier and
therefore saved more lives? Yes,

696
00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:31.102
therefore saved more lives? Yes,
very difficult to get the timing

697
00:22:31.102 --> 00:22:32.436
very difficult to get the timing
right. We knew the measures that

698
00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:34.936
right. We knew the measures that
would have to be taken and everyone

699
00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:36.686
would have to be taken and everyone
knew what was going to have to be

700
00:22:36.686 --> 00:22:41.144
knew what was going to have to be
done. I think the issue was, the

701
00:22:41.144 --> 00:22:43.186
done. I think the issue was, the
advice we were getting from some

702
00:22:43.186 --> 00:22:45.727
advice we were getting from some
elements of the advisory groups were

703
00:22:45.727 --> 00:22:47.686
elements of the advisory groups were
that we could only do this for a

704
00:22:47.686 --> 00:22:50.894
that we could only do this for a
limited time to get the maximum

705
00:22:50.894 --> 00:22:52.727
limited time to get the maximum
benefit we had to wait until the

706
00:22:52.727 --> 00:22:54.561
benefit we had to wait until the
right moment and then apply the

707
00:22:54.561 --> 00:22:58.227
right moment and then apply the
brakes and get the best effect that

708
00:22:58.227 --> 00:23:00.102
brakes and get the best effect that
could possibly be delivered. A very

709
00:23:00.102 --> 00:23:03.727
could possibly be delivered. A very
difficult thing. This is a new type

710
00:23:03.727 --> 00:23:04.352
difficult thing. This is a new type
of vims.

711
00:23:04.352 --> 00:23:05.436
difficult thing. This is a new type
of virus. And really we don’t know

712
00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:06.269
of vims. And really we don’t know
until we try at

713
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:07.102
of virus. And really we don’t know
until we try at what’s going to be

714
00:23:07.102 --> 00:23:09.811
until we try at what’s going to be
effective. Darren, from your

715
00:23:09.811 --> 00:23:12.769
effective. Darren, from your
perspective, what’s your view in

716
00:23:12.769 --> 00:23:14.311
perspective, what’s your view in
terms of, have we learnt lessons?

717
00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:16.186
terms of, have we learnt lessons?
How is it looking from where you are

718
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:17.977
How is it looking from where you are
sitting?

719
00:23:17.977 --> 00:23:19.644
How is it looking from where you are
sitting? In terms of comparisons

720
00:23:19.644 --> 00:23:23.394
sitting? In terms of comparisons
from other countries?

721
00:23:23.394 --> 00:23:24.144
sitting? In terms of comparisons
from other countries? I mean,

722
00:23:24.144 --> 00:23:25.852
from other countries? I mean,
sometimes it can be too simple to

723
00:23:25.852 --> 00:23:26.311
sometimes it ran be too simple to
compare one

724
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:27.769
sometimes it can be too simple to
compare one country with another

725
00:23:27.769 --> 00:23:30.186
compare one country with another
country and often we lack a lot of

726
00:23:30.186 --> 00:23:35.061
country and often we lack a lot of
the context of how those societies

727
00:23:35.061 --> 00:23:36.519
the context of how those societies
have developed, how they organise

728
00:23:36.519 --> 00:23:38.102
have developed, how they organise
their economies but one thing I’ve

729
00:23:38.102 --> 00:23:40.977
their economies but one thing I’ve
noticed, and this is my own

730
00:23:40.977 --> 00:23:42.686
noticed, and this is my own
anecdotal reading of it so correct

731
00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:45.352
anecdotal reading of it so correct
me if I’m wrong, but it seems like

732
00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:47.561
me if I’m wrong, but it seems like
societies where inequality is high

733
00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:50.102
societies where inequality is high
are more vulnerable. You can see

734
00:23:50.102 --> 00:23:51.102
are more vulnerable. You ran see
that in the

735
00:23:51.102 --> 00:23:52.269
are more vulnerable. You can see
that in the United States, the only

736
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:53.686
that in the United States, the only
society that is more unequal than

737
00:23:53.686 --> 00:23:57.352
society that is more unequal than
the UK. I think that accounts for

738
00:23:57.352 --> 00:24:01.936
the UK. I think that accounts for
all sorts of reasons. Obviously

739
00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:03.852
all sorts of reasons. Obviously
right now, people like to refer to

740
00:24:03.852 --> 00:24:04.727
right now, peopla like to refer to
what’s

741
00:24:04.727 --> 00:24:06.019
right now, people like to refer to
what’s happening in Sweden as an

742
00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:07.852
what’s happening in Sweden as an
argument for loosening restrictions

743
00:24:07.852 --> 00:24:10.269
argument for loosening restrictions
but in Sweden they’ve got higher

744
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.477
but in Sweden therve got higher
levels

745
00:24:10.477 --> 00:24:11.727
but in Sweden they’ve got higher
levels of investment in public

746
00:24:11.727 --> 00:24:12.686
levels of investment in public
services, higher levels of public

747
00:24:12.686 --> 00:24:15.852
services, higher levels of public
trust in government, higher levels

748
00:24:15.852 --> 00:24:17.269
trust in government, higher levels
of personal responsibility because

749
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:18.186
of personal responsibility because
of those investments over the

750
00:24:18.186 --> 00:24:19.936
of those investments over the
long-term.

751
00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:21.727
of those investments over the
long—term. Whereas the short—term is

752
00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:22.477
long-term. whereas the short-term is
that lights the

753
00:24:22.477 --> 00:24:24.644
long—term. Whereas the short—term is
that lights the British political

754
00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:26.936
that lights the British political
class in this country is really the

755
00:24:26.936 --> 00:24:27.936
class in this country is really the
chickens coming home to roost

756
00:24:27.936 --> 00:24:31.269
chickens coming home to roost
unfortunately. I don’t say that

757
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:34.686
unfortunately. I don’t say that
glibly or facetiously.

758
00:24:34.686 --> 00:24:35.602
unfortunately. I don’t say that
glibly orfacetiously. I really

759
00:24:35.602 --> 00:24:36.102
unfortunately. I don’t say that
glibly or facetiously. I really hope

760
00:24:36.102 --> 00:24:38.269
glibly or facetiously. I really hope
this is a sobering moment for all

761
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:39.852
this is a sobering moment for all
politicians of all parties, that the

762
00:24:39.852 --> 00:24:40.019
politicians of all parties, that the
“Y

763
00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:42.102
politicians of all parties, that the
way we organise our society is

764
00:24:42.102 --> 00:24:45.977
way we organise our society is
fundamentally unstable in many ways.

765
00:24:45.977 --> 00:24:50.477
fundamentally unstable in many ways.
Even Bill Gates, who many think is

766
00:24:50.477 --> 00:24:53.894
Even Bill Gates, who many think is
in cahoots with some sort of

767
00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:54.102
Even Bill Gates, who many think is
in cahoots with some sort ofJewish

768
00:24:54.102 --> 00:24:54.519
in cahoots with some sort of jewish
race of

769
00:24:54.519 --> 00:24:57.561
in cahoots with some sort ofJewish
race of aliens from China, nonsense

770
00:24:57.561 --> 00:24:59.852
race of aliens from China, nonsense
like that, emerging from a society

771
00:24:59.852 --> 00:25:02.352
like that, emerging from a society
where there is very low trust in

772
00:25:02.352 --> 00:25:03.144
where there is very low trust in
institutions, low levels of

773
00:25:03.144 --> 00:25:07.102
institutions, low levels of
education and so on, he said himself

774
00:25:07.102 --> 00:25:08.602
education and so on, he said himself
that his foundation and others had

775
00:25:08.602 --> 00:25:09.894
that his foundation and others had
brought to the attention of

776
00:25:09.894 --> 00:25:14.436
brought to the attention of
governments the risk of pandemic and

777
00:25:14.436 --> 00:25:16.102
governments the risk of pandemic and
not having vaccines developed. All

778
00:25:16.102 --> 00:25:18.352
not having vaccines developed. All
of the risks he outlined and he said

779
00:25:18.352 --> 00:25:20.269
of the risks he outlined and he said
that if we’d invested a fraction in

780
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.436
that if we’d invested a fraction in
that sort of research and early

781
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:22.436
that sort of research and earty
warning

782
00:25:22.436 --> 00:25:26.311
that sort of research and early
warning system that we do regularly,

783
00:25:26.311 --> 00:25:26.561
warning system that we do regularty,
maintaining

784
00:25:26.561 --> 00:25:27.686
warning system that we do regularly,
maintaining the nuclear arsenal, we

785
00:25:27.686 --> 00:25:29.186
maintaining the nuclear arsenal, we
might not find ourselves in the

786
00:25:29.186 --> 00:25:32.894
might not find ourselves in the
situation we are currently in. This

787
00:25:32.894 --> 00:25:35.477
situation we are currently in. This
is a moment of immense humility for

788
00:25:35.477 --> 00:25:38.102
is a moment of immense humility for
us who are deeply invested in the

789
00:25:38.102 --> 00:25:41.852
us who are deeply invested in the
economic and political status quo in

790
00:25:41.852 --> 00:25:43.894
economic and political status quo in
society I can’t think of a better

791
00:25:43.894 --> 00:25:47.102
society I can’t think of a better
argument for looking at it again.

792
00:25:47.102 --> 00:25:49.936
argument for looking at it again.
Rachel? Going back to the question,

793
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:50.227
Rachel? Going back to the question,
there are

794
00:25:50.227 --> 00:25:52.102
Rachel? Going back to the question,
there are obviously things we need

795
00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:53.519
there are obviously things we need
to learn from Italy’s

796
00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:54.894
there are obviously things we need
to learn from Italy’s experience and

797
00:25:54.894 --> 00:25:55.644
to learn from Italrs experience and
certainly at

798
00:25:55.644 --> 00:25:56.852
to learn from Italy’s experience and
certainly at the beginning of this

799
00:25:56.852 --> 00:25:58.519
certainly at the beginning of this
it didn’t feel like the policies

800
00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.519
it didn’t feel like the policies
around lockdown for example came

801
00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:02.102
around lockdown for example fame
quickly

802
00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:07.102
around lockdown for example came
quickly enough. Do you think that

803
00:26:07.102 --> 00:26:07.311
quickly enough. Do you think that
labour

804
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:10.102
quickly enough. Do you think that
Labour applied enough pressure? Was

805
00:26:10.102 --> 00:26:10.477
labour applied enough pressure? Was
there a

806
00:26:10.477 --> 00:26:11.477
Labour applied enough pressure? Was
there a sense they were missing in

807
00:26:11.477 --> 00:26:13.102
there a sense they were missing in
action for the first few weeks of

808
00:26:13.102 --> 00:26:15.019
action for the first few weeks of
the crisis because much of the focus

809
00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:17.519
the crisis because much of the focus
was on the leadership election. In

810
00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:19.436
was on the leadership election. In
the end the government had to make

811
00:26:19.436 --> 00:26:22.311
the end the government had to make
decisions. I know, but Labour have a

812
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:24.519
decisions. I know, but labour have a
rola to play as

813
00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:25.311
decisions. I know, but Labour have a
role to play as the opposition. Yes,

814
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:26.311
role to play as the opposition. Yes,
certainly under Keir Starmer’s

815
00:26:26.311 --> 00:26:26.519
certainly under Keir Starmer’s
leadership

816
00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:29.144
certainly under Keir Starmer’s
leadership over the last few days,

817
00:26:29.144 --> 00:26:32.269
leadership over the last few days,
Labour’s approach has been around

818
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.852
Laboqu approach has been around
supporting the

819
00:26:32.852 --> 00:26:34.061
Labour’s approach has been around
supporting the government when they

820
00:26:34.061 --> 00:26:36.186
supporting the government when they
get it right, willing the government

821
00:26:36.186 --> 00:26:37.977
get it right, willing the government
to succeed because it’s in all our

822
00:26:37.977 --> 00:26:40.102
to succeed because it’s in all our
interests for them to succeed but

823
00:26:40.102 --> 00:26:42.561
interests for them to succeed but
asking difficult questions to be

824
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:44.269
asking difficult questions to be
constructed. It’s true questioning

825
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.477
constructed. It’s tme questioning
and

826
00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:47.227
constructed. It’s true questioning
and challenge that you get a better

827
00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:49.936
and challenge that you get a better
decision made. The point I wanted to

828
00:26:49.936 --> 00:26:53.144
decision made. The point I wanted to
mate, we need to learn from

829
00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:53.686
mate, we need to learn from
experience --

830
00:26:53.686 --> 00:26:54.727
mate, we need to learn from
experience —— with the point I

831
00:26:54.727 --> 00:26:54.811
experience -- with the point I
wanted

832
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:56.394
experience —— with the point I
wanted to make, we are learning from

833
00:26:56.394 --> 00:26:58.436
wanted to make, we are learning from
the experience of other countries

834
00:26:58.436 --> 00:27:00.311
the experience of other countries
but we are rapidly catching up. We

835
00:27:00.311 --> 00:27:01.977
but we are rapidly catching up. We
need to listen to people on the

836
00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:06.727
need to listen to people on the
front line, those in the NHS and the

837
00:27:06.727 --> 00:27:07.102
front line, those in the NHS and the
social rare

838
00:27:07.102 --> 00:27:08.269
front line, those in the NHS and the
social care sector. What they are

839
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:09.477
social rare sector. what they are
saying, what I

840
00:27:09.477 --> 00:27:10.852
social care sector. What they are
saying, what I hear in Leeds where I

841
00:27:10.852 --> 00:27:12.811
saying, what I hear in Leeds where I
am the MP, we need more testing, we

842
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:15.852
am the MP, we need more testing, we
need to be testing people who were

843
00:27:15.852 --> 00:27:17.436
need to be testing people who were
on the front line in higher numbers

844
00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:20.102
on the front line in higher numbers
and ramping it up quicker but also

845
00:27:20.102 --> 00:27:21.561
and ramping it up quicker but also
and I think most importantly, we

846
00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:25.269
and I think most importantly, we
need to give people on the front

847
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:26.644
need to give people on the front
line the protective equipment and

848
00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:30.769
line the protective equipment and
clothing they’re crying out for.

849
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:34.852
clothing therre crying out for.
We’ve

850
00:27:34.852 --> 00:27:37.269
clothing they’re crying out for.
We’ve seen terrible examples, nurses

851
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:38.727
We’ve seen terrible examples, nurses
in Harrow using bin liners to

852
00:27:38.727 --> 00:27:39.727
in Harrow using bin liners to
protect themselves because there was

853
00:27:39.727 --> 00:27:43.602
protect themselves because there was
nothing else and they now have

854
00:27:43.602 --> 00:27:44.894
nothing else and they now have
coronavirus and a doctor from East

855
00:27:44.894 --> 00:27:46.102
coronavirus and a doctor from East
London who wrote to the Prime

856
00:27:46.102 --> 00:27:47.977
London who wrote to the Prime
Minister saying,

857
00:27:47.977 --> 00:27:48.144
London who wrote to the Prime
Ministersaying, give

858
00:27:48.144 --> 00:27:48.561
London who wrote to the Prime
Minister saying, give us the

859
00:27:48.561 --> 00:27:50.602
Minister saying, give us the
protective equipment, and now that

860
00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:53.894
protective equipment, and now that
Doctor is dead. I would say to the

861
00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:55.436
Doctor is dead. I would say to the
government that those who understand

862
00:27:55.436 --> 00:27:57.102
government that those who understand
this best are those on the front

863
00:27:57.102 --> 00:27:58.602
this best are those on the front
line who are delivering the care to

864
00:27:58.602 --> 00:27:58.977
line who are delivering the rare to
the people

865
00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.269
line who are delivering the care to
the people who are our friends and

866
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:02.186
the people who are our friends and
neighbours and loved ones. We need

867
00:28:02.186 --> 00:28:05.019
neighbours and loved ones. We need
to ensure that their voices are

868
00:28:05.019 --> 00:28:07.936
to ensure that their voices are
being heard in this. When they say

869
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:08.477
being heard in this. when they say
that we

870
00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:09.561
being heard in this. When they say
that we don’t have the protective

871
00:28:09.561 --> 00:28:12.019
that we don’t have the protective
equipment, it’s not to be difficult

872
00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:14.936
equipment, it’s not to be difficult
and cause problems. I know that you

873
00:28:14.936 --> 00:28:15.269
and cause problams. I know that you
know that,

874
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:16.061
and cause problems. I know that you
know that, Brandon. It’s because

875
00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:17.477
know that, Brandon. It’s because
they are trying to do the right

876
00:28:17.477 --> 00:28:19.269
they are trying to do the right
thing and they deserve the best

877
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:21.102
thing and they deserve the best
equipment to protect themselves and

878
00:28:21.102 --> 00:28:23.102
equipment to protect themselves and
the people they are supporting in

879
00:28:23.102 --> 00:28:23.477
the peopla they are supporting in
hospitals or

880
00:28:23.477 --> 00:28:24.102
the people they are supporting in
hospitals or social care settings

881
00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:24.477
hospitals or social rare settings
and they

882
00:28:24.477 --> 00:28:26.519
hospitals or social care settings
and they say they don’t have that.

883
00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:28.686
and they say they don’t have that.
More than anything else that has to

884
00:28:28.686 --> 00:28:30.561
More than anything else that has to
be the number one priority of

885
00:28:30.561 --> 00:28:32.769
be the number one priority of
government, to ensure that the

886
00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:35.436
government, to ensure that the
people who are dedicating their

887
00:28:35.436 --> 00:28:36.602
peopla who are dedicating their
lives,

888
00:28:36.602 --> 00:28:37.477
people who are dedicating their
lives, because of their vocation,

889
00:28:37.477 --> 00:28:39.102
lives, because of their vocation,
putting themselves at risk, that we

890
00:28:39.102 --> 00:28:41.644
putting themselves at risk, that we
are doing everything in our power to

891
00:28:41.644 --> 00:28:44.144
are doing everything in our power to
give them all the material and

892
00:28:44.144 --> 00:28:45.602
give them all the material and
equipment and clothing that they

893
00:28:45.602 --> 00:28:47.727
equipment and clothing that they
need to keep themselves safe. We’ve

894
00:28:47.727 --> 00:28:49.644
need to keep themselves safe. We’ve
got a situation at the moment where

895
00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:51.852
got a situation at the moment where
about 8% of people in the NHS are

896
00:28:51.852 --> 00:28:53.102
about 896 of peopla in the NHS are
off sick.

897
00:28:53.102 --> 00:28:55.686
about 8% of people in the NHS are
off sick. And probably the same

898
00:28:55.686 --> 00:28:57.519
off sick. And probably the same
again in social care. If we ramped

899
00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:57.727
again in social rare. If we ramped
“P

900
00:28:57.727 --> 00:28:58.102
again in social rare. If we ramped
up testing and

901
00:28:58.102 --> 00:28:58.769
again in social care. If we ramped
up testing and gave them the

902
00:28:58.769 --> 00:29:01.644
up testing and gave them the
protective clothing we could ensure

903
00:29:01.644 --> 00:29:04.311
protective clothing we could ensure
that those on the front line, ensure

904
00:29:04.311 --> 00:29:06.186
that those on the front line, ensure
that when it comes to an end, we’ve

905
00:29:06.186 --> 00:29:08.144
that when it comes to an end, we’ve
lost as few lives as possible.

906
00:29:08.144 --> 00:29:09.852
lost as few lives as possible.
That’s all our priority but we have

907
00:29:09.852 --> 00:29:12.686
That’s all our priority but we have
to listen to those workers. Peter, I

908
00:29:12.686 --> 00:29:14.477
to listen to those workers. Peter, I
want to come to you. We will move

909
00:29:14.477 --> 00:29:17.186
want to come to you. We will move
onto a different element a moment.

910
00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:17.894
onto a different element a moment.
when it

911
00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:19.477
onto a different element a moment.
When it comes to testing and people

912
00:29:19.477 --> 00:29:21.561
When it comes to testing and people
comment about testing to us time and

913
00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:23.852
comment about testing to us time and
time again, were we too slow to get

914
00:29:23.852 --> 00:29:25.602
time again, were we too slow to get
off the mark with testing in your

915
00:29:25.602 --> 00:29:27.102
off the mark with testing in your
view as a scientist advising the

916
00:29:27.102 --> 00:29:32.269
view as a scientist advising the
government? I’m sorry, the line has

917
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:34.019
government? I’m sorry, the line has
been breaking up at this end. Can

918
00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:37.019
been breaking up at this end. (“an
you hear me?

919
00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:38.102
been breaking up at this end. Can
you hear me? Yes, can you hear us?

920
00:29:38.102 --> 00:29:38.436
you hear me? Yes, ran you hear us?
Rachel has

921
00:29:38.436 --> 00:29:40.602
you hear me? Yes, can you hear us?
Rachel has been talking about

922
00:29:40.602 --> 00:29:42.769
Rachel has been talking about
testing. Were we too slow getting

923
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:45.436
testing. Were we too slow getting
off the ground with testing? I think

924
00:29:45.436 --> 00:29:47.019
off the ground with testing? I think
nobody would say we’ve been able to

925
00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:52.186
nobody would say we’ve been able to
test enough and to be quick enough

926
00:29:52.186 --> 00:29:53.227
test enough and to be quick enough
off the mark. It’s incredibly

927
00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:54.477
off the mark. It’s incredibly
important to appreciate the brave

928
00:29:54.477 --> 00:29:57.644
important to appreciate the brave
work of scientists who have been

929
00:29:57.644 --> 00:29:58.602
work of scientists who have been
developing testing. They’ve been

930
00:29:58.602 --> 00:29:58.852
developing testing. Therve been
working

931
00:29:58.852 --> 00:30:00.102
developing testing. They’ve been
working really hard to build up from

932
00:30:00.102 --> 00:30:03.436
working really hard to build up from
a fairly low base because there

933
00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:03.686
a fairty low base because there
hasn’t

934
00:30:03.686 --> 00:30:04.311
a fairly low base because there
hasn’t been enough investment in

935
00:30:04.311 --> 00:30:04.686
hasn’t been enough investment in
pub“:

936
00:30:04.686 --> 00:30:06.102
hasn’t been enough investment in
public health over the last ten

937
00:30:06.102 --> 00:30:09.811
public health over the last ten
years. The public health

938
00:30:09.811 --> 00:30:11.936
years. The public health
infrastructure has been repeatedly

939
00:30:11.936 --> 00:30:13.061
infrastmclure has been repeatedly
reorganised.

940
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:15.686
infrastructure has been repeatedly
reorganised. I think we know now

941
00:30:15.686 --> 00:30:18.311
reorganised. I think we know now
that we get on with the testing but

942
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:19.519
that we get on with the testing but
it’s really important that its high

943
00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:25.144
it’s really important that its high
quality testing. We know

944
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:28.102
quality testing. We know that
there’s nothing worse than a bad

945
00:30:28.102 --> 00:30:29.769
there’s nothing worse than a bad
test, so we have to have really good

946
00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:32.686
test, so we have to have really good
tests. Let me give you a flavour of

947
00:30:32.686 --> 00:30:33.186
tests. Let me give you a ﬂavour of
some of

948
00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:34.227
tests. Let me give you a flavour of
some of the comments that people are

949
00:30:34.227 --> 00:30:37.686
some of the comments that people are
sending. Chris, was it a mistake to

950
00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:38.061
sending. Chris, was ita mistake to
employ the

951
00:30:38.061 --> 00:30:38.686
sending. Chris, was it a mistake to
employ the herd immunity strategy

952
00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:40.852
employ the herd immunity strategy
and then change it to mass

953
00:30:40.852 --> 00:30:43.394
and then change it to mass
isolation, losing many days? Neal

954
00:30:43.394 --> 00:30:45.561
isolation, losing many days? Neal
asks if it’s time for a cross—party

955
00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:49.061
asks if it’s time for a cross—party
committee for Covid—19, making the

956
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:49.186
committee for Covid-19, making the
decisions

957
00:30:49.186 --> 00:30:50.977
committee for Covid—19, making the
decisions and taking the politics

958
00:30:50.977 --> 00:30:51.394
decisions and taking the politic
out of

959
00:30:51.394 --> 00:30:52.727
decisions and taking the politics
out of it? Tom says, how much of a

960
00:30:52.727 --> 00:30:56.686
out of it? Tom says, how much of a
risk is a second wave pandemic as

961
00:30:56.686 --> 00:30:58.811
risk is a second wave pandemic as
there was in 1918? Is the government

962
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:01.269
there was in 1918? Is the government
planning for it? Let me move onto

963
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:05.394
planning for it? Let me move onto
question from Thomas. Clearly we are

964
00:31:05.394 --> 00:31:06.061
question from Thomas. Cleariy we are
all in

965
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:07.352
question from Thomas. Clearly we are
all in distress at this difficult

966
00:31:07.352 --> 00:31:08.602
all in distress at this difficult
time and people deal with it

967
00:31:08.602 --> 00:31:12.561
time and people deal with it
differently. Recently a high—profile

968
00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:12.769
differently. Recenﬂya high-profit;
figure

969
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:14.227
differently. Recently a high—profile
figure travelled with her family to

970
00:31:14.227 --> 00:31:18.561
figure travelled with her family to
deal with this in her own way. With

971
00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:19.019
deal with this in her own way. with
such strict

972
00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:19.644
deal with this in her own way. With
such strict restrictions on her

973
00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:22.019
such strict restrictions on her
Civil Liberties and to us all, what

974
00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:24.644
Civil Liberties and to us all, what
does the panel think the wider

975
00:31:24.644 --> 00:31:25.769
does the panel think the wider
impact could be on our mental

976
00:31:25.769 --> 00:31:30.977
impact could be on our mental
health?

977
00:31:33.644 --> 00:31:33.936
ﬂ

978
00:31:33.936 --> 00:31:38.269
I think Thomas is referring to the
Scottish Chief Medical Officer. Ruby

979
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:41.061
Scottish Chief Medical Officer. Ruby
Wax, I want to bring you in. The

980
00:31:41.061 --> 00:31:42.561
Wax, I want to bring you in. The
impact on our mental health is

981
00:31:42.561 --> 00:31:43.769
impact on our mental health is
something a lot of people are

982
00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:43.977
something a lot of peopla are
talking

983
00:31:43.977 --> 00:31:45.352
something a lot of people are
talking about and there is a lot of

984
00:31:45.352 --> 00:31:50.061
talking about and there is a lot of
concern about it. What is your view?

985
00:31:50.061 --> 00:31:50.769
concern about it. what is your view?
Yes, there is a

986
00:31:50.769 --> 00:31:51.436
concern about it. What is your view?
Yes, there is a break—up on the

987
00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:52.769
Yes, there is a break-up on the
line. So

988
00:31:52.769 --> 00:31:52.977
Yes, there is a break-up on the
line. Sol

989
00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:53.644
Yes, there is a break—up on the
line. So I didn’t really hear the

990
00:31:53.644 --> 00:31:57.602
line. So I didn’t really hear the
question. In terms of concerns about

991
00:31:57.602 --> 00:31:59.144
question. In terms of concerns about
the impact on peoples mental health

992
00:31:59.144 --> 00:32:02.644
the impact on peoples mental health
of the lockdown, of isolation,

993
00:32:02.644 --> 00:32:09.852
of the lockdown, of isolation,
simply of loneliness. Yeah. We are

994
00:32:09.852 --> 00:32:11.519
simply of loneliness. Yeah. We are
stating the obvious. People say, we

995
00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:13.102
stating the obvious. People say, we
need more of this. We all know we

996
00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:15.602
need more of this. We all know we
need more. But there is an emergency

997
00:32:15.602 --> 00:32:17.436
need more. But there is an emergency
right now so rather than saying,

998
00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:19.811
right now so rather than saying,
should we have done this, you know,

999
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:21.894
should we have done this, you know,
those of us who have mental health

1000
00:32:21.894 --> 00:32:24.602
those of us who have mental health
issues, we have been practising this

1001
00:32:24.602 --> 00:32:26.019
issues, we have been practising this
for years, so it’s almost like the

1002
00:32:26.019 --> 00:32:26.602
for years, so it’s almost like the
world is now

1003
00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:30.436
for years, so it’s almost like the
world is nowjoining us. Sorry to go

1004
00:32:30.436 --> 00:32:30.936
world is now joining us. Sorry to go
on about

1005
00:32:30.936 --> 00:32:34.144
world is nowjoining us. Sorry to go
on about what I do, but I have an

1006
00:32:34.144 --> 00:32:34.352
on about what I do, but I have an
onUne

1007
00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:37.769
on about what I do, but I have an
online service called Fresnel cafe

dot org and everyday, twice a day,

1009
00:32:42.144 --> 00:32:44.811
dot org and everyday, twice a day,
there are 100 people each time and

1010
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:46.477
there are 100 people each time and
it’s a community of people who

1011
00:32:46.477 --> 00:32:46.686
it’s a community of peopla who
express

1012
00:32:46.686 --> 00:32:47.727
it’s a community of people who
express themselves, and really

1013
00:32:47.727 --> 00:32:49.436
express themselves, and really
emotionally we are not equipped for

1014
00:32:49.436 --> 00:32:50.227
emotionally we are not equipped for
this, and it’s not

1015
00:32:50.227 --> 00:32:50.852
emotionally we are not equipped for
this, and it’s notjust about being

1016
00:32:50.852 --> 00:32:56.019
this, and it’s not just about being
mentally ill.

1017
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:58.769
mentally ill. I wish politicians
would speak human—to—human at one

1018
00:32:58.769 --> 00:32:59.477
would speak human-to-human at one
point. We have

1019
00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.019
would speak human—to—human at one
point. We have not been trained

1020
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.269
point. We have not been trained
emotionally. We don’t understand it

1021
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:05.186
emotionally. We don’t understand it
is human to be sad to feel like a

1022
00:33:05.186 --> 00:33:07.061
is human to be sad to feel like a
failure that we have avoided those

1023
00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:12.561
failure that we have avoided those
issues. Along.

1024
00:33:14.144 --> 00:33:18.061
issues. Along.
SOUND BREAKS UP.

1025
00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:19.977
SOUND BREAKS UP.
Plan, sadly there is break—up on

1026
00:33:19.977 --> 00:33:20.269
Plan, sadly there is break-up on
your line,

1027
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:22.477
Plan, sadly there is break—up on
your line, Rugby. We will try and

1028
00:33:22.477 --> 00:33:26.852
your line, Rugby. We will try and
fix that, Rugby. Frustratingly, you

1029
00:33:26.852 --> 00:33:28.436
fix that, Rugby. Frustratingly, you
are cutting in and out. Darren, let

1030
00:33:28.436 --> 00:33:31.936
are cutting in and out. Darren, let
me come to you. The Chancellor

1031
00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:33.477
me come to you. The Chancellor
talked about as all being in this

1032
00:33:33.477 --> 00:33:36.227
talked about as all being in this
together but when it comes to the

1033
00:33:36.227 --> 00:33:37.352
together but when it comes to the
restriction of civil liberties

1034
00:33:37.352 --> 00:33:38.686
restriction of civil liberties
Thomas was talking about and the

1035
00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:40.269
Thomas was talking about and the
effect on our mental health, we are

1036
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:42.394
effect on our mental health, we are
not, are we? It’s much easier

1037
00:33:42.394 --> 00:33:42.602
effect on our mental health, we are
not, are we? It’s much easierfor

1038
00:33:42.602 --> 00:33:45.061
not, are we? It’s much easier for
some peopla to

1039
00:33:45.061 --> 00:33:45.852
not, are we? It’s much easierfor
some people to isolate and much

1040
00:33:45.852 --> 00:33:46.019
some peopla to isolate and much
harder

1041
00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:46.602
some people to isolate and much
harder for others,

1042
00:33:46.602 --> 00:33:46.769
some people to isolate and much
harderfor others, people

1043
00:33:46.769 --> 00:33:46.936
some people to isolate and much
harder for others, people living

1044
00:33:46.936 --> 00:33:47.186
some people to isolate and much
harderfor others, people living in

1045
00:33:47.186 --> 00:33:47.561
harder for others, peopla living in
ﬂats, that

1046
00:33:47.561 --> 00:33:52.186
harderfor others, people living in
flats, that kind of thing.

1047
00:33:52.186 --> 00:33:52.727
ﬂats, that kind of thing.
Yes, I

1048
00:33:52.727 --> 00:33:53.727
flats, that kind of thing.
Yes, I think most people are going

1049
00:33:53.727 --> 00:33:54.102
Yes, I think most peopla are going
to be

1050
00:33:54.102 --> 00:33:55.394
Yes, I think most people are going
to be experiencing some level of

1051
00:33:55.394 --> 00:33:57.769
to be experiencing some level of
mental and emotional discomfort

1052
00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:00.269
mental and emotional discomfort
relative to what they can tolerate,

1053
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:02.352
relative to what they ran tolerate,
so while

1054
00:34:02.352 --> 00:34:03.102
relative to what they can tolerate,
so while obviously some people are

1055
00:34:03.102 --> 00:34:03.352
so whila obviously some peopla are
actually

1056
00:34:03.352 --> 00:34:05.269
so while obviously some people are
actually dealing materially with

1057
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:07.477
actually dealing materially with
more acute circumstances, everybody

1058
00:34:07.477 --> 00:34:10.852
more acute circumstances, everybody
feels a certain level of strain and

1059
00:34:10.852 --> 00:34:12.852
feels a certain level of strain and
experiences certain levels of stress

1060
00:34:12.852 --> 00:34:15.186
experiences certain levels of stress
and anxiety, and it’s important to

1061
00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:16.644
and anxiety, and it’s important to
note that that is affecting

1062
00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:17.227
note that that is affecting
everybody and not

1063
00:34:17.227 --> 00:34:17.852
note that that is affecting
everybody and notjust people who

1064
00:34:17.852 --> 00:34:18.186
everybody and not just peopla who
are

1065
00:34:18.186 --> 00:34:21.227
everybody and notjust people who
are struggling financially. But the

1066
00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:22.144
are stmggling financially. But the
impact of

1067
00:34:22.144 --> 00:34:24.436
are struggling financially. But the
impact of isolation compounded with

1068
00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:31.019
impact of isolation compounded with
financial strain, insecurity, as

1069
00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:33.477
financial strain, insecurity, as
well as many households where you

1070
00:34:33.477 --> 00:34:35.144
well as many households where you
have children who have grown up in

1071
00:34:35.144 --> 00:34:36.227
have children who have grown up in
that household perhaps with an

1072
00:34:36.227 --> 00:34:41.186
that household perhaps with an
abusive parent, active addiction in

1073
00:34:41.186 --> 00:34:43.852
abusive parent, active addiction in
the household, the impacts there are

1074
00:34:43.852 --> 00:34:44.811
the household, the impacts there are
quite severe, and as for

1075
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:47.352
the household, the impacts there are
quite severe, and as forjust

1076
00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:48.644
quite severe, and as forjust
isolation in and of itself, social

1077
00:34:48.644 --> 00:34:49.436
isolation in and of itself, social
interaction and connection is

1078
00:34:49.436 --> 00:34:52.644
interaction and connection is
everything in life, from the moment

1079
00:34:52.644 --> 00:34:54.644
everything in life, from the moment
that we are in the womb, when we

1080
00:34:54.644 --> 00:34:57.894
that we are in the womb, when we
hear the voice of our mother, this

1081
00:34:57.894 --> 00:34:59.186
hear the voice of our mother, this
brings online many of our first

1082
00:34:59.186 --> 00:35:02.436
brings online many of our first
cognitive systems. As we develop as

1083
00:35:02.436 --> 00:35:04.061
cognitive systems. As we develop as
children we get a sense of our place

1084
00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:05.436
children we get a sense of our place
in the world as well as our

1085
00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:08.602
in the world as well as our
personality. It’s shaped by the

1086
00:35:08.602 --> 00:35:09.686
personality. It’s shaped by the
quality of the social connections

1087
00:35:09.686 --> 00:35:11.519
quality of the social connections
around us and, even when we are

1088
00:35:11.519 --> 00:35:13.519
around us and, even when we are
adults and living our lives, without

1089
00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:13.977
adults and living our lives, without
other peopla

1090
00:35:13.977 --> 00:35:17.602

feelings, we become very unwell very

1098
00:35:27.977 --> 00:35:29.394
feelings, we become very unwell very
quickly, and the problem is we very

1099
00:35:29.394 --> 00:35:32.727
quickly, and the problem is we very
often don’t detect how and where we

1100
00:35:32.727 --> 00:35:34.311
often don’t detect how and where we
have become. We to live in our own

1101
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:36.811
have become. We to live in our own
heads and to buy into the anxieties

1102
00:35:36.811 --> 00:35:40.061
heads and to buy into the anxieties
and fears and resentments that often

1103
00:35:40.061 --> 00:35:40.602
and fears and resentments that often
we ran get

1104
00:35:40.602 --> 00:35:43.602
and fears and resentments that often
we can get away with in daily life

1105
00:35:43.602 --> 00:35:43.977
we ran get away with in daily life
by mnning

1106
00:35:43.977 --> 00:35:45.394
we can get away with in daily life
by running out for a job or going on

1107
00:35:45.394 --> 00:35:47.894
by mnning out for a job or going on
a long drive or

1108
00:35:47.894 --> 00:35:48.686
by running out for a job or going on
a long drive or booking a holiday or

1109
00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:50.436
a long drive or booking a holiday or
doing some retail therapy. Now, a

1110
00:35:50.436 --> 00:35:54.686
doing some retail therapy. Now, a
lot of things we previously defined

1111
00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:56.352
lot of things we previously defined
ourselves by have been removed so

1112
00:35:56.352 --> 00:35:57.269
ourselves by have been removed so
it’s very challenging in many

1113
00:35:57.269 --> 00:36:02.977
it’s very challenging in many
respects. I want to touch quickly to

1114
00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:04.352
respects. I want to touch quickly to
pluck up quickly, please, because we

1115
00:36:04.352 --> 00:36:08.436
pluck up quickly, please, because we
have Ruby back.

1116
00:36:08.436 --> 00:36:09.602
have Ruby back.
The case for listening the lockdown

1117
00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:09.811
The rase for listening the lockdown
because

1118
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:11.602
The case for listening the lockdown
because of the impacts we are going

1119
00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:12.852
because of the impacts we are going
to see on people, including the

1120
00:36:12.852 --> 00:36:13.019
to see on peopla, including the
mental

1121
00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:14.352
to see on people, including the
mental health problems and people

1122
00:36:14.352 --> 00:36:14.727
mental health problams and peopla
who are

1123
00:36:14.727 --> 00:36:15.477
mental health problems and people
who are not getting treated for

1124
00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:18.936
who are not getting treated for
cancer. The difference between all

1125
00:36:18.936 --> 00:36:20.102
cancer. The difference between all
of the negative impacts of the

1126
00:36:20.102 --> 00:36:22.644
of the negative impacts of the
lockdown, whether they be medical or

1127
00:36:22.644 --> 00:36:24.936
lockdown, whether they be medical or
mental or emotional or financial is

1128
00:36:24.936 --> 00:36:26.352
mental or emotional or financial is
that these things are unknown

1129
00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:29.561
that these things are unknown
quantities, so we know roughly how

1130
00:36:29.561 --> 00:36:31.227
quantities, so we know roughly how
to address a lot of those things and

1131
00:36:31.227 --> 00:36:34.102
to address a lot of those things and
at least mitigate them, we can

1132
00:36:34.102 --> 00:36:34.269
at least mitigate them, we ran
divert

1133
00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:36.019
at least mitigate them, we can
divert resources and raise awareness

1134
00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:38.436
divert resources and raise awareness
and deploy people in the community.

Covid—19 is an unknown quantity.

Covid-19 is an unknown quantity.
Still

00:36:40.936 --> 00:36:42.727
Covid—19 is an unknown quantity.
Still don’t know basic things about

Still don’t know basic things about

don’t dismiss completely those

1143
00:36:59.852 --> 00:37:00.852
don’t dismiss completely those
arguments for listening the

1144
00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:01.811
arguments for listening the
lockdown, particularly for those who

1145

lockdown, particularty for those who
might be in

1146

lockdown, particularly for those who
might be in some danger, Covid—19,

we don’t

1148

might be in some danger, Covid—19,
we don’t know enough about it, we

we don’t know enough about it, we
don’t know what sort of genie we are

that, but it’s a

1155
00:37:20.186 --> 00:37:21.977
is keen to come in. Will understand
that, but it’s a lot of platitudes.

that, but it’s a lot of platitudes.
What

1157

that, but it’s a lot of platitudes.
what do

1158
00:37:22.269 --> 00:37:27.977
that, but it’s a lot of platitudes.

what do we do that connects peopla.
what is

1162
00:37:30.186 --> 00:37:31.561
What do we do that connects people.
What is inspiring is that, when you

1163
00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:32.061
what is inspiring is that, when you
see peopla

1164
00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:32.352
What is inspiring is that, when you
see people now, they

1165
00:37:32.352 --> 00:37:33.269
What is inspiring is that, when you
see people now, they are connecting

1166
00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:34.227
see peopla now, they are connecting
in a way

1167
00:37:34.227 --> 00:37:35.061
see people now, they are connecting
in a way they have never connected

1168
00:37:35.061 --> 00:37:36.144
in a way they have never connected
before, because now we need each

1169
00:37:36.144 --> 00:37:39.727
before, because now we need each
other. We are in mutual trauma, so

1170
00:37:39.727 --> 00:37:41.852
other. We are in mutual trauma, so
it’s no good talking about, of

1171
00:37:41.852 --> 00:37:43.602
it’s no good talking about, of
course, if we lived in a world where

1172

course, if we lived in a world where
our earty

our early identity was what we did

1174
00:37:44.936 --> 00:37:46.519
our earty identity was what we did
for a living and

1175
00:37:46.519 --> 00:37:47.436
our early identity was what we did
for a living and we are run by

1176
00:37:47.436 --> 00:37:47.977
for a living and we are mn by
social

1177
00:37:47.977 --> 00:37:49.227
for a living and we are run by
social media, so maybe we can learn

1178
00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:50.852
social media, so maybe we ran learn
what is going on

1179
00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:51.644
social media, so maybe we can learn
what is going on now, but I had

1180
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:54.394
what is going on now, but I had
somebody on the line today during

will make you feel better even if

1195
00:38:16.144 --> 00:38:18.227
will make you feel better even if
you are depressed. By the way, there

1196
00:38:18.227 --> 00:38:22.727
you are depressed. By the way, there
will be a tsunami when this is over.

1197
00:38:22.727 --> 00:38:23.769
will be a tsunami when this is over.
Let’s concentrate on physical safety

1198
00:38:23.769 --> 00:38:25.977
Let’s concentrate on physical safety
now. I

1199
00:38:25.977 --> 00:38:27.061
Let’s concentrate on physical safety
now. Ithink, by

1200
00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:27.644
Let’s concentrate on physical safety
now. I think, by being aware of

1201
00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:28.852
now. I think, by being aware of
other people, which we haven’t been

1202
00:38:28.852 --> 00:38:32.227
other people, which we haven’t been
for a long time, that kindness, as I

1203
00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:39.311
for a long time, that kindness, as I
say, is infectious, so we should try

1204
00:38:40.311 --> 00:38:42.102
say, is infectious, so we should try
and create or help somebody. I love

1205
00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:46.061
and create or help somebody. I love
that the Queen came on... We don’t

1206
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:49.394
that the Queen came on... We don’t
have a voice that

1207
00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:49.602
that the Queen came on... We don’t
have a voice thatjust

1208
00:38:49.602 --> 00:38:50.561
that the Queen came on... We don’t
have a voice thatjustjust say,

1209
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.644
have a voice that just just say,
yes, we are in

1210
00:38:51.644 --> 00:38:52.227
have a voice thatjustjust say,
yes, we are in danger, we shouldn’t

1211
00:38:52.227 --> 00:38:54.936
yes, we are in danger, we shouldn’t
go out. We know that, but somebody

1212
00:38:54.936 --> 00:38:57.686
go out. We know that, but somebody
to help us understand it is human to

1213
00:38:57.686 --> 00:38:59.352
to help us understand it is human to
be sad and to feel like a failure.

1214
00:38:59.352 --> 00:38:59.769
be sad and to feel like a failure.
just be

1215
00:38:59.769 --> 00:39:02.019
be sad and to feel like a failure.
Just be honest and speak human

1216
00:39:02.019 --> 00:39:02.186
just be honest and speak human
rather

1217
00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:03.061
Just be honest and speak human
rather than standing on your

1218
00:39:03.061 --> 00:39:04.769
rather than standing on your
soapbox. I think we can make a

1219
00:39:04.769 --> 00:39:08.852
soapbox. I think we can make a
connection that might last past this

1220
00:39:08.852 --> 00:39:10.977
connection that might last past this
catastrophe. You talk about the

1221
00:39:10.977 --> 00:39:14.227
catastrophe. You talk about the
longer term impact once we get past

1222
00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:15.061
longer term impact once we get past
fight or ﬂight.

1223
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:15.144
longer term impact once we get past
fight orﬂight. You

1224
00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:15.936
longer term impact once we get past
fight or flight. You talk about a

1225
00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:16.186
fight or ﬂight. You talk about a
tsunami

1226
00:39:16.186 --> 00:39:17.102
fight or flight. You talk about a
tsunami of depression, and I hope

1227
00:39:17.102 --> 00:39:18.644
tsunami of depression, and I hope
not. what

1228
00:39:18.644 --> 00:39:19.686
tsunami of depression, and I hope
not. What do you think the longer

1229
00:39:19.686 --> 00:39:19.977
not. what do you think the longer
term impact

1230
00:39:19.977 --> 00:39:21.894
not. What do you think the longer
term impact will be? the longer term

1231
00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:26.519
term impact will be? the longer term
impact is some people are resilient,

1232
00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:26.894
impact is some peopla are resilient,
it’s in

1233
00:39:26.894 --> 00:39:28.144
impact is some people are resilient,
it’s in their genes, and other

1234
00:39:28.144 --> 00:39:31.144
it’s in their genes, and other
people are vulnerable. There will be

1235
00:39:31.144 --> 00:39:35.561
people are vulnerable. There will be
major mental illness and, as I

1236
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:36.561
major mental illness and, as I
always say, mental isn’t something

1237
00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:39.311
always say, mental isn’t something
that happens from the neck up.

1238
00:39:39.311 --> 00:39:40.394
that happens from the neck up.
Mental is physical. It will

1239
00:39:40.394 --> 00:39:41.977
Mental is physical. It will
breakdown your immune system, make

1240
00:39:41.977 --> 00:39:44.186
breakdown your immune system, make
you even more vulnerable. But I

1241
00:39:44.186 --> 00:39:47.311
you even more vulnerable. But I
don’t want to stoke fear. I really

1242
00:39:47.311 --> 00:39:48.019
don’t want to stoke fear. I really
think peopla

1243
00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:49.269
don’t want to stoke fear. I really
think people should try and connect

1244
00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:49.686
think peopla should try and connect
to other

1245
00:39:49.686 --> 00:39:50.769
think people should try and connect
to other people. I know they can’t

1246
00:39:50.769 --> 00:39:52.561
to other peopla. I know they can’t
do it

1247
00:39:52.561 --> 00:39:53.811
to other people. I know they can’t
do it physically, but we were always

1248
00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:55.977
do it physically, but we were always
too busy in our lives before. Maybe

1249
00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.936
too busy in our lives before. Maybe
now we have the time to make that

1250
00:39:57.936 --> 00:39:59.727
now we have the time to make that
phone call and reach out. Maybe we

1251
00:39:59.727 --> 00:40:01.936
phone call and reach out. Maybe we
could all get the phone numbers of

1252
00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:03.269
could all get the phone numbers of
five other people and call up and

1253
00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:03.727
five other peopla and all up and
ask how

1254
00:40:03.727 --> 00:40:03.977
five other people and all up and
ask how they

1255
00:40:03.977 --> 00:40:05.852
five other people and call up and
ask how they are. Let’s make some of

1256
00:40:05.852 --> 00:40:11.269
ask how they are. Let’s make some of
these possibilities. Brandon do you

1257
00:40:11.269 --> 00:40:14.061
these possibilities. Brandon do you
want to talk human? I always try but

1258
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:15.602
want to talk human? I always try but
as a politician I might not succeed.

1259
00:40:15.602 --> 00:40:18.144
as a politician I might not succeed.
That point is really interesting.

1260
00:40:18.144 --> 00:40:20.352
That point is really interesting.
One thing I found was,

1261
00:40:20.352 --> 00:40:20.602
That point is really interesting.
One thing Ifound was, first

1262
00:40:20.602 --> 00:40:21.019
That point is really interesting.
One thing I found was, first of all,

1263
00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:22.727
One thing I found was, first of all,
I have worked hard to keep a bit of

1264
00:40:22.727 --> 00:40:24.727
I have worked hard to keep a bit of
a routine, that I have been talking

1265
00:40:24.727 --> 00:40:26.144
a routine, that I have been talking
to friends and had calls from

1266
00:40:26.144 --> 00:40:27.686
to friends and had falls from
friends, as

1267
00:40:27.686 --> 00:40:28.977
to friends and had calls from
friends, as wife has, but I wouldn’t

1268
00:40:28.977 --> 00:40:30.186
friends, as wife has, but I wouldn’t
normally speak to as regularly, and

1269
00:40:30.186 --> 00:40:30.602
normally speak to as regularty, and
I think

1270
00:40:30.602 --> 00:40:32.144
normally speak to as regularly, and
I think there is an important thing,

1271
00:40:32.144 --> 00:40:35.769
I think there is an important thing,
and one benefit... At the Home

1272

about the

about the dangers of social media

1275
00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:42.436
about the dangers of social media
but technology can be really helpful

1276
00:40:42.436 --> 00:40:42.852
but technology ran be really helpful
for the

1277
00:40:42.852 --> 00:40:45.561

for the various apps to connect with

1278
00:40:45.561 --> 00:40:46.769
for the various apps to connect with
peopla. It’s not

1279
00:40:46.769 --> 00:40:47.477
for the various apps to connect with
people. It’s not the same as body

1280
00:40:47.477 --> 00:40:47.936
peopla. It’s not the same as body
language but

1281
00:40:47.936 --> 00:40:49.102
people. It’s not the same as body
language but you can see people and

1282
00:40:49.102 --> 00:40:49.686
language but you ran see peopla and
talk to peopla

1283
00:40:49.686 --> 00:40:50.769
language but you can see people and
talk to people and reach out for

1284
00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:51.144
talk to peopla and reach out for
those

connect with a friend or somebody

1287
00:40:53.602 --> 00:40:55.352
connect with a friend or somebody
you haven’t seen for a while or

1288
00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:57.352
you haven’t seen for a while or
because you need help or you think

1289
00:40:57.352 --> 00:40:59.186
because you need help or you think
they need support, it’s important to

1290
00:40:59.186 --> 00:41:00.852
they need support, it’s important to
do that, and I’ve noticed that in my

1291
00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:03.602
do that, and I’ve noticed that in my
life. A few friends I have spoken to

1292
00:41:03.602 --> 00:41:05.144
life. A few friends I have spoken to
that I haven’t spoken to for a while

1293
00:41:05.144 --> 00:41:05.602
that I haven’t spoken to for a whila
and I

1294
00:41:05.602 --> 00:41:06.602
that I haven’t spoken to for a while
and I made the effort and that’s

1295
00:41:06.602 --> 00:41:10.352
and I made the effort and that’s
important. We are never trained in

1296
00:41:10.352 --> 00:41:13.102
important. We are never trained in
listening, and I hope social media

1297
00:41:13.102 --> 00:41:15.727
listening, and I hope social media
now develops ways of saying on

1298
00:41:15.727 --> 00:41:17.519
now develops ways of saying on
Twitter, I don’t feel well, I

1299
00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:17.769
now develops ways of saying on
Twitter, I don’t feel well, Ifeel

1300
00:41:17.769 --> 00:41:18.144
Twitter, Idon’t feel well, Ifeel
weak today,

1301
00:41:18.144 --> 00:41:18.936
Twitter, I don’t feel well, Ifeel
weak today, and everybody will rush

1302
00:41:18.936 --> 00:41:21.144
weak today, and everybody will rush
to help you rather than having to

1303
00:41:21.144 --> 00:41:24.227
to help you rather than having to
show, look what I’ve got, look at my

1304
00:41:24.227 --> 00:41:25.727
show, look what I’ve got, look at my
status. I think that it drove up a

1305
00:41:25.727 --> 00:41:29.186
status. I think that it drove up a
lot mental strain. Now we can learn.

1306
00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:30.102
lot mental strain. Now we ran learn.

totally agree with Ruby. It seems,

1311
00:41:34.061 --> 00:41:36.686
totally agree with Ruby. It seems,
if you have already received

if you have already received
treatment for mental health it’s

1313

treatment for mental health it’s
ready in your tool box for coping

with isolation and this person says,

with isolation and this person says,
the impact on mental health will be

1316
00:41:45.227 --> 00:41:47.061
the impact on mental health will be
huge. Anybody looked away from human

1317

what about the mental health and

1320
00:41:52.602 --> 00:41:54.352
what about the mental health and
wellbeing of people who are in

1321
00:41:54.352 --> 00:41:55.602
wellbeing of people who are in
lockdown alone, living in flats or

1322
00:41:55.602 --> 00:41:56.519
lockdown alone, living in ﬂats or
apartments?

1323
00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:57.644
lockdown alone, living in flats or
apartments? Why can’t they sit in a

1324
00:41:57.644 --> 00:42:00.227
apartments? why can’t they sit in a
park? Come

1325
00:42:00.227 --> 00:42:02.186
apartments? Why can’t they sit in a
park? Come back to Thomas’s

1326
00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.227
park? Come back to Thomas’s
question, he struck about the

1327
00:42:03.227 --> 00:42:04.352
question, he struck about the
restrictions on civil liberties and

1328
00:42:04.352 --> 00:42:08.227
restrictions on civil liberties and
the impact on mental health. I think

1329
00:42:08.227 --> 00:42:09.852
the impact on mental health. I think
the term social distancing is

1330
00:42:09.852 --> 00:42:11.477
the term social distancing is
unhelpful, because we need physical

1331
00:42:11.477 --> 00:42:14.061
unhelpful, because we need physical
distancing, and we are doing that

1332
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:16.311
distancing, and we are doing that
now, that we don’t want to be

1333
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:18.186
now, that we don’t want to be
socially distancing from people, we

1334
00:42:18.186 --> 00:42:18.519
socially distancing from peopla, we
want to

1335
00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:19.311
socially distancing from people, we
want to keep up those connections,

1336
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:20.602
want to keep up those connections,
because they are really important to

1337
00:42:20.602 --> 00:42:22.144
because they are really important to
help us through this. I totally

1338
00:42:22.144 --> 00:42:25.894
help us through this. I totally
agree with Ruby that a lot of

1339
00:42:25.894 --> 00:42:25.977
agree with Ruby that a lot of
peoplas

1340
00:42:25.977 --> 00:42:27.686
agree with Ruby that a lot of
peoples mental health will be very

1341
00:42:27.686 --> 00:42:28.769
peoplas mental health will be very
badly

1342
00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:30.102
peoples mental health will be very
badly affected by this. Some people

1343
00:42:30.102 --> 00:42:31.352
badly affected by this. Some people
already struggle with mental health

1344
00:42:31.352 --> 00:42:32.769
already struggle with mental health
and other people who might not have

1345
00:42:32.769 --> 00:42:33.019
and other peopla who might not have
known

1346
00:42:33.019 --> 00:42:34.644
and other people who might not have
known that they struggled but

1347
00:42:34.644 --> 00:42:36.811
known that they struggled but
certainly are struggling with it

1348
00:42:36.811 --> 00:42:37.144
certainly are stmggling with it
right now

1349
00:42:37.144 --> 00:42:38.227
certainly are struggling with it
right now also, I think Ruby’s point

1350
00:42:38.227 --> 00:42:41.144
right now also, I think Ruby’s point
about it unleashing some really

1351
00:42:41.144 --> 00:42:42.852
about it unleashing some really
wonderful things in our society as

1352
00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:44.644
wonderful things in our society as
well, all of this. We are looking

1353
00:42:44.644 --> 00:42:46.061
well, all of this. We are looking
out for our neighbours and friends.

1354
00:42:46.061 --> 00:42:48.811
out for our neighbours and friends.
We are phoning family members and

1355
00:42:48.811 --> 00:42:54.352
We are phoning family members and
recognising that, actually, we are

1356
00:42:54.352 --> 00:42:55.727
recognising that, actually, we are
not little isolated atoms, we are

1357
00:42:55.727 --> 00:42:57.269
not little isolated atoms, we are
part of something bigger, and

1358
00:42:57.269 --> 00:43:00.727
part of something bigger, and
looking out for others. I also agree

1359
00:43:00.727 --> 00:43:02.269
looking out for others. I also agree
with Brandon Lewis’s point about a

1360
00:43:02.269 --> 00:43:05.519
with Brandon Lewis’s point about a
routine. I’ve got two little

1361
00:43:05.519 --> 00:43:06.852
routine. I’ve got two little
children so I am home—schooling as

1362
00:43:06.852 --> 00:43:07.269
children so I am home-schooling as
well as

1363
00:43:07.269 --> 00:43:10.311
children so I am home—schooling as
well as everything else. How’s it

1364
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:12.894
well as everything else. Hovfs it
going? I

1365
00:43:12.894 --> 00:43:13.894
well as everything else. How’s it
going? I mean, I’m brilliant at it,

1366
00:43:13.894 --> 00:43:17.477
going? I mean, I’m brilliant at it,
not. But it gives you a routine. You

1367
00:43:17.477 --> 00:43:19.936
not. But it gives you a routine. You
get up in the morning, you do pee

1368
00:43:19.936 --> 00:43:20.769
get up in the morning, you do pee
with joe, you

1369
00:43:20.769 --> 00:43:21.561
get up in the morning, you do pee
withJoe, you might do some maths

1370
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:22.061
with joe, you might do some maths
and literacy

1371
00:43:22.061 --> 00:43:24.269
withJoe, you might do some maths
and literacy and then you let them

1372
00:43:24.269 --> 00:43:26.186
and literacy and then you let them
play with a Lego. —— you do physical

1373
00:43:26.186 --> 00:43:26.436
play with a Lego. -- you do physical
education

education withJoe. I’m very lucky

1376
00:43:27.852 --> 00:43:29.477
education with joe. I’m very lucky
for the

1377
00:43:29.477 --> 00:43:30.769
education withJoe. I’m very lucky
for the I’ve with the people I love

1378
00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:32.561
for the I’ve with the peopla I love
but that

1379
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:33.352
for the I’ve with the people I love
but that isn’t the same for

1380
00:43:33.352 --> 00:43:34.686
but that isn’t the same for
everybody. Some people are on their

1381
00:43:34.686 --> 00:43:36.311
everybody. Some people are on their
own, and that’s really difficult.

those experiences... It comes back

1391
00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:53.311
those experiences... It comes back
to Darren’s point. Not everybody is

1392
00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:54.352
to Darren’s point. Not everybody is
experiencing the lockdown in the

1393
00:43:54.352 --> 00:43:57.561
experiencing the lockdown in the
same way. It depends on your

1394
00:43:57.561 --> 00:44:00.227
same way. It depends on your
circumstances, in terms of your

1395
00:44:00.227 --> 00:44:01.227
circumstances, in terms of your
mental health, physical health and

1396
00:44:01.227 --> 00:44:02.519
mental health, physical health and
to the surroundings in which you

1397
00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:03.519
to the surroundings in which you
live, and I think those

1398
00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:06.561
live, and I think those
inequalities, they are stark in

1399
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:07.936
inequalities, they are stark in
society, and they are coming home to

1400
00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:10.144
society, and they are coming home to
us and I hope after this we can

1401
00:44:10.144 --> 00:44:10.602
us and I hope after this we ran
build a

1402
00:44:10.602 --> 00:44:11.394
us and I hope after this we can
build a different type of society

1403
00:44:11.394 --> 00:44:14.811
build a different type of society
where we worry more about mental

1404
00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:15.769
where we worry more about mental
health and social connections and

1405
00:44:15.769 --> 00:44:16.019
health and social connections and
tacklc

1406
00:44:16.019 --> 00:44:17.477
health and social connections and
tackle some of those economic

1407
00:44:17.477 --> 00:44:19.019
tackle some of those economic
inequalities which mean some people

1408
00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:22.311
inequalities which mean some people
have so little and some so much.

1409
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:25.102
have so little and some so much.
Peter, you are listening patiently.

1410
00:44:25.102 --> 00:44:26.227
Peter, you are listening patiently.
Is the effect on mental health

1411
00:44:26.227 --> 00:44:27.769
Is the effect on mental health
something you factor in when you

1412
00:44:27.769 --> 00:44:29.144
something you factor in when you
come up with your plans and advice

1413
00:44:29.144 --> 00:44:33.769
come up with your plans and advice
for the government? Yes, on the

1414
00:44:33.769 --> 00:44:35.602
for the government? Yes, on the
advisory committees there are mental

1415
00:44:35.602 --> 00:44:36.561
advisory committees there are mental
health experts and it’s really

1416
00:44:36.561 --> 00:44:37.894
health experts and it’s really
valuable to have them there. We

1417
00:44:37.894 --> 00:44:41.352
valuable to have them there. We
should also flag up that there are

1418
00:44:41.352 --> 00:44:41.436
should also ﬂag up that there are
quite

1419
00:44:41.436 --> 00:44:42.686
should also flag up that there are
quite profound consequences on the

1420
00:44:42.686 --> 00:44:45.561
quite profound consequences on the
mental health of some of the key

1421
00:44:45.561 --> 00:44:49.394
mental health of some of the key
workers and health care workers, in

1422
00:44:49.394 --> 00:44:49.894
workers and health rare workers, in
particular, who

1423
00:44:49.894 --> 00:44:50.311
workers and health care workers, in
particular, who take extremely

1424
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:52.894
particular, who take extremely
difficult decisions under very tough

1425
00:44:52.894 --> 00:44:54.019
difficult decisions under very tough
circumstances. They have to make

1426
00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:57.102
circumstances. They have to make
life and death decisions that they

1427
00:44:57.102 --> 00:44:57.936
life and death decisions that they
feel really uncomfortable about

1428
00:44:57.936 --> 00:45:00.227
feel really uncomfortable about
subsequently. This has been

1429
00:45:00.227 --> 00:45:02.894
subsequently. This has been
highlighted by colleagues at King’s

1430
00:45:02.894 --> 00:45:05.436
highlighted by colleagues at King’s
College London talking about moral

1431
00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:08.977
College London talking about moral
injury in that you have to make a

1432
00:45:08.977 --> 00:45:10.769
injury in that you have to make a
decision which you then go away and

1433
00:45:10.769 --> 00:45:12.519
decision which you then go away and
think about afterwards and you

1434
00:45:12.519 --> 00:45:14.102
think about afterwards and you
think, that person could have lived

1435
00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:15.269
think, that person could have lived
if only I’d made a different

1436
00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:18.561
if only I’d made a different
decision. And they feel a great

1437
00:45:18.561 --> 00:45:24.727
decision. And they feel a great
sense of loss and guilt. Ruby, you

1438
00:45:24.727 --> 00:45:28.561
sense of loss and guilt. Ruby, you
wanted to add something. I

1439
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:30.269
wanted to add something. I
completely sympathise with that, and

1440
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:32.394
completely sympathise with that, and
rather than saying, should we have

1441
00:45:32.394 --> 00:45:36.102
rather than saying, should we have
done something earlier, it would be

1442
00:45:36.102 --> 00:45:36.477
done something eartier, it would be
nice now

1443
00:45:36.477 --> 00:45:36.727
done something earlier, it would be
nice new if

1444
00:45:36.727 --> 00:45:37.102
done something earlier, it would be
nice now if somebody could

1445
00:45:37.102 --> 00:45:39.769
nice now if somebody could
concentrate a little on what we

1446
00:45:39.769 --> 00:45:42.936
concentrate a little on what we
should do when the trauma really

1447
00:45:42.936 --> 00:45:44.102
should do when the trauma really
kicks in, if somebody could put

1448
00:45:44.102 --> 00:45:46.311
kicks in, if somebody could put
their attention on that? That will

1449
00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:50.102
their attention on that? That will
be the second or third wave. We will

1450
00:45:50.102 --> 00:45:53.977
be the second or third wave. We will
be mentally shaken. I don’t mean

1451
00:45:53.977 --> 00:45:55.102
be mentally shaken. I don’t mean
people with mental illness, I mean

1452
00:45:55.102 --> 00:45:57.561
people with mental illness, I mean
those people on the front line. Can

1453
00:45:57.561 --> 00:45:58.019
those people on the front line. (“an
we start

1454
00:45:58.019 --> 00:45:59.186
those people on the front line. Can
we start thinking of what we can do

1455
00:45:59.186 --> 00:46:02.102
we start thinking of what we ran do
now? Let

1456
00:46:02.102 --> 00:46:03.436
we start thinking of what we can do
now? Let me take another question

1457
00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:04.519
now? Let me take another question
which is particularly pertinent as

1458
00:46:04.519 --> 00:46:05.519
which is particularty pertinent as
we are

1459
00:46:05.519 --> 00:46:06.519
which is particularly pertinent as
we are coming up to Easter weekend,

1460
00:46:06.519 --> 00:46:10.144
we are coming up to Easter weekend,
from Louis Kulik. With the lockdown

1461
00:46:10.144 --> 00:46:10.477
from Louis Kulik. with the lockdown
taking its

1462
00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:11.352
from Louis Kulik. With the lockdown
taking its mental toll on many

1463
00:46:11.352 --> 00:46:13.436
taking its mental toll on many
members of the public, is it right

1464
00:46:13.436 --> 00:46:14.519
members of the public, is it right
for them to use their allocated

1465
00:46:14.519 --> 00:46:15.644
for them to use their allocated
allowance outside the home for

1466
00:46:15.644 --> 00:46:20.519
allowance outside the home for
things other than exercise? Darren,

1467
00:46:20.519 --> 00:46:21.977
things other than exercise? Darren,
there has been so much talk from

1468
00:46:21.977 --> 00:46:25.644
there has been so much talk from
police constables and the government

1469
00:46:25.644 --> 00:46:26.561
police constables and the government
and [oral

1470
00:46:26.561 --> 00:46:27.352
police constables and the government
and local councils, some of them

1471
00:46:27.352 --> 00:46:28.102
and [oral councils, some of them
dosing parks,

1472
00:46:28.102 --> 00:46:29.269
and local councils, some of them
closing parks, and we heard the

1473
00:46:29.269 --> 00:46:29.561
dosing parks, and we heard the
government

1474
00:46:29.561 --> 00:46:30.727
closing parks, and we heard the
government saying, don’t close parks

1475
00:46:30.727 --> 00:46:33.102
government saying, don’t close parks
unless you absolutely have to, if

1476
00:46:33.102 --> 00:46:36.436
unless you absolutely have to, if
you have got a back garden, it’s not

1477
00:46:36.436 --> 00:46:37.686
you have got a back garden, it’s not
so bad. Obviously, you haven’t, it’s

1478
00:46:37.686 --> 00:46:38.102
so bad. Obviously, you haven’t, it’s
a whola

1479
00:46:38.102 --> 00:46:40.227
so bad. Obviously, you haven’t, it’s
a whole different story. The

1480
00:46:40.227 --> 00:46:41.519
a whole different story. The
question is about, should people use

1481
00:46:41.519 --> 00:46:43.644
question is about, should people use
their time outside, should they be

1482
00:46:43.644 --> 00:46:46.811
their time outside, should they be
able to use it for things other than

1483
00:46:46.811 --> 00:46:47.936
able to use it for things other than
exercise, like playing with the kids

1484
00:46:47.936 --> 00:46:48.311
exercise, like playing with the kids
or just

1485
00:46:48.311 --> 00:46:48.561
exercise, like playing with the kids
orjust getting

1486
00:46:48.561 --> 00:46:48.769
exercise, like playing with the kids
or just getting fresh

1487
00:46:48.769 --> 00:46:50.186
exercise, like playing with the kids
orjust getting fresh air? What is

1488
00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:55.269
or just getting fresh air? what is
your view?

1489
00:46:55.977 --> 00:46:58.644
your view? Where you speaking to me?

1490
00:46:58.644 --> 00:47:01.644
your view? where you speaking to me?
I was.

1491
00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:03.894
your view? where you speaking to me?
Iwas. it’s

1492
00:47:03.894 --> 00:47:04.102
your view? where you speaking to me?
I was. it’s very

1493
00:47:04.102 --> 00:47:04.686
your view? Where you speaking to me?
I was. it’s very strange being in

1494
00:47:04.686 --> 00:47:06.686
I was. it’s very strange being in
this kind of non—environment and

1495
00:47:06.686 --> 00:47:10.102
this kind of non—environment and
connected to you. The whole thing is

1496
00:47:10.102 --> 00:47:10.227
connected to you. The whola thing is
very

1497
00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:15.269
connected to you. The whole thing is
very strange.

1498
00:47:15.686 --> 00:47:19.019
very strange. Louis Kulik was
asking, is it right, given the

1499
00:47:19.019 --> 00:47:20.936
asking, is it right, given the
mental toll that lockdown can take

1500
00:47:20.936 --> 00:47:21.602
mental toll that lockdown ran take
on peopla, is

1501
00:47:21.602 --> 00:47:23.727
mental toll that lockdown can take
on people, is it right for them to

1502
00:47:23.727 --> 00:47:23.894
on peopla, is it right for them to
use

1503
00:47:23.894 --> 00:47:24.852
on people, is it right for them to
use their allocated allowance

1504
00:47:24.852 --> 00:47:26.019
use their allocated allowance
outside the home for things other

1505
00:47:26.019 --> 00:47:28.436
outside the home for things other
than exercise? We have heard

1506
00:47:28.436 --> 00:47:30.602
than exercise? We have heard
different things about whether

1507
00:47:30.602 --> 00:47:31.144
different things about whether
peopla

1508
00:47:31.144 --> 00:47:32.811
different things about whether
people can sit down in a park or sit

1509
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:33.394
peopla ran sit down in a park or sit
on a bench

1510
00:47:33.394 --> 00:47:35.477
people can sit down in a park or sit
on a bench or they can’t? What does

1511
00:47:35.477 --> 00:47:36.102
on a bench or they ain’t? what does
it look like

1512
00:47:36.102 --> 00:47:39.144
on a bench or they can’t? What does
it look like to you? I think there

1513
00:47:39.144 --> 00:47:43.644
it look like to you? I think there
is a risk for people in terms of the

1514
00:47:43.644 --> 00:47:44.019
is a risk for people in terms of the
level of

1515
00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:44.436
is a risk for people in terms of the
level ofjudgment that

1516
00:47:44.436 --> 00:47:44.936
is a risk for people in terms of the
level of judgment that they might

1517
00:47:44.936 --> 00:47:45.102
level ofjudgment that they might
experience

1518
00:47:45.102 --> 00:47:46.102
level of judgment that they might
experience from other members of the

1519
00:47:46.102 --> 00:47:47.811
experience from other members of the
public. There was a kind of

1520
00:47:47.811 --> 00:47:51.227
public. There was a kind of
McCarthyism creeping in slightly

1521
00:47:51.227 --> 00:47:51.977
Md’arthyism creeping in slightly
wear, you

1522
00:47:51.977 --> 00:47:52.811
McCarthyism creeping in slightly
wear, you know, you have got

1523
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:55.102
wear, you know, you have got
middle—class people on Instagram

1524
00:47:55.102 --> 00:47:56.477
middle-class peopla on Instagram
doing

1525
00:47:56.477 --> 00:47:57.269
middle—class people on Instagram
doing clarinet lessons and yoga,

1526
00:47:57.269 --> 00:48:00.602
doing clarinet lessons and yoga,
meanwhile the working class people

1527
00:48:00.602 --> 00:48:02.269
meanwhile the working class people
were unsure if they have all the

1528
00:48:02.269 --> 00:48:04.977
were unsure if they have all the
suppUes

1529
00:48:04.977 --> 00:48:06.019
were unsure if they have all the
supplies they have two survive are

supplies they have two survive are
being viewed sceptically on the news

1531
00:48:07.352 --> 00:48:07.727
being viewed sceptirauy on the news
on public

1532
00:48:07.727 --> 00:48:08.644
being viewed sceptically on the news
on public transport and harangued by

1533
00:48:08.644 --> 00:48:10.519
on public transport and harangued by
police. I

1534
00:48:10.519 --> 00:48:10.644
on public transport and harangued by
police. Ithink

1535
00:48:10.644 --> 00:48:11.519
on public transport and harangued by
police. I think that is beginning to

1536
00:48:11.519 --> 00:48:13.519
police. I think that is beginning to
factor into how people move around.

1537
00:48:13.519 --> 00:48:14.602
factor into how peopla move around.
It certainly is for

1538
00:48:14.602 --> 00:48:17.102
factor into how people move around.
It certainly is for me. I think more

1539
00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:21.144
It certainly is for me. I think more
clear guidance in terms of what

1540
00:48:21.144 --> 00:48:21.936
clear guidance in terms of what
wouldn’t undermine the general

1541
00:48:21.936 --> 00:48:22.936
wouldn’t undermine the general
effort of everyone in society

effort of everyone in society

outdoors and breathing fresh air and

1548
00:48:32.186 --> 00:48:34.686
outdoors and breathing fresh air and
getting a bit of exercise does help

1549
00:48:34.686 --> 00:48:37.186
getting a bit of exercise does help
immensely. I have had my fair share

1550
00:48:37.186 --> 00:48:40.727
immensely. I have had my fair share
of mental health problems and I’m in

1551
00:48:40.727 --> 00:48:42.602
of mental health problems and I’m in
recovery from alcoholism and

1552
00:48:42.602 --> 00:48:43.727
recovery from alcoholism and
addiction and there are certain

1553
00:48:43.727 --> 00:48:47.602
addiction and there are certain
things I need to be able to

1554
00:48:47.602 --> 00:48:48.977
things I need to be able to
function. I am quite limited right

1555
00:48:48.977 --> 00:48:50.269
function. lam quite limited right
in what I

1556
00:48:50.269 --> 00:48:53.061
function. I am quite limited right
in what I can do. If I can run for

1557
00:48:53.061 --> 00:48:53.477
in what I ran do. If I ran nm for
20 minutes

1558
00:48:53.477 --> 00:48:53.894
in what I can do. If I can run for
20 minutes or even

1559
00:48:53.894 --> 00:48:54.102
in what I can do. If I can run for
20 minutes or evenjust

1560
00:48:54.102 --> 00:48:54.352
in what I can do. If I can run for
20 minutes or even just walk,

1561
00:48:54.352 --> 00:48:54.519
in what I can do. If I can run for
20 minutes or evenjust walk, I

1562
00:48:54.519 --> 00:48:54.769
in what I can do. If I can run for
20 minutes or evenjust walk, Ifeel

1563
00:48:54.769 --> 00:48:55.227
20 minutes or even just walk, I feel
a lot better,

1564
00:48:55.227 --> 00:48:58.644
20 minutes or evenjust walk, Ifeel
a lot better, but I know the options

1565
00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:00.769
a lot better, but I know the options
available to me might not be

1566
00:49:00.769 --> 00:49:02.269
available to me might not be
available to everyone right now. I

1567
00:49:02.269 --> 00:49:03.894
available to everyone right now. I
hope that answers the question. It’s

1568
00:49:03.894 --> 00:49:06.686
hope that answers the question. It’s
hard to hear what you’re asking. You

1569
00:49:06.686 --> 00:49:11.186
hard to hear what you’re asking. You
are doing a sterling job. Some

1570
00:49:11.186 --> 00:49:11.602
are doing a starting job. Some
peopla are

1571
00:49:11.602 --> 00:49:12.561
are doing a sterling job. Some
people are asking, why can’t I sit

1572
00:49:12.561 --> 00:49:13.186
peopla are asking, why can’t I sit
on a park

1573
00:49:13.186 --> 00:49:16.061
people are asking, why can’t I sit
on a park bench or

1574
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:16.936
people are asking, why can’t I sit
on a park bench orjust lie down on

1575
00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:18.227
on a park bench or just lie down on
a piece of grass

1576
00:49:18.227 --> 00:49:19.227
on a park bench orjust lie down on
a piece of grass and soak up some

1577
00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:23.811
a piece of grass and soak up some
rays? Is coming back to the point

1578
00:49:23.811 --> 00:49:27.102
rays? Is coming back to the point
about thinking about... We have been

1579
00:49:27.102 --> 00:49:28.352
about thinking about... We have been
mentioning about the people on the

1580
00:49:28.352 --> 00:49:30.561
mentioning about the people on the
front line. What I would say to

1581
00:49:30.561 --> 00:49:30.936
front line. what I would say to
peopla is,

1582
00:49:30.936 --> 00:49:32.227
front line. What I would say to
people is, every time you do

1583
00:49:32.227 --> 00:49:34.102
people is, every time you do
something that moves away from where

1584
00:49:34.102 --> 00:49:35.311
something that moves away from where
the guidelines are and you do

1585
00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:36.811
the guidelines are and you do
something unnecessary, you are

1586
00:49:36.811 --> 00:49:38.769
something unnecessary, you are
creating a bit more risk of another

1587
00:49:38.769 --> 00:49:40.477
creating a bit more risk of another
person been ill and putting more

1588
00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.019
person been ill and putting more
pressure on people on the front line

1589
00:49:42.019 --> 00:49:43.936
pressure on people on the front line
to whom we owe a huge debt for what

1590
00:49:43.936 --> 00:49:46.477
to whom we owe a huge debt for what
they are doing, and they are some of

1591
00:49:46.477 --> 00:49:47.727
they are doing, and they are some of
the peoples who need that

1592
00:49:47.727 --> 00:49:49.102
the peoples who need that
opportunity themselves to get out

1593
00:49:49.102 --> 00:49:50.477
opportunity themselves to get out
for some exercise and fresh air and

1594
00:49:50.477 --> 00:49:54.602
for some exercise and fresh air and
space. And on, some people might

1595
00:49:54.602 --> 00:49:55.644
space. And on, some peopla might
say, why is it OK

1596
00:49:55.644 --> 00:49:56.269
space. And on, some people might
say, why is it OK for somebody to

1597
00:49:56.269 --> 00:49:58.102
say, why is it OK for somebody to
walk in a park for 20 minutes but

1598
00:49:58.102 --> 00:50:01.936
walk in a park for 20 minutes but
not sit on a park bench is part of

1599
00:50:01.936 --> 00:50:04.477
not sit on a park bench is part of
it is down to that social behaviour

1600
00:50:04.477 --> 00:50:05.811
it is down to that social behaviour
and the way that people work and

1601
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:06.061
and the way that peopla work and
interact

1602
00:50:06.061 --> 00:50:07.644
and the way that people work and
interact with each other. If

1603
00:50:07.644 --> 00:50:09.102
interact with each other. If
somebody goes into a park and is

1604
00:50:09.102 --> 00:50:10.936
somebody goes into a park and is
sitting on a bench or sitting and

1605
00:50:10.936 --> 00:50:12.436
sitting on a bench or sitting and
sunbathing and simply decides to do

1606
00:50:12.436 --> 00:50:18.644
sunbathing and simply decides to do
the same, you quickly get to a point

1607
00:50:18.644 --> 00:50:19.102
the same, you quickly get to a point
where, peopla

1608
00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:19.727
the same, you quickly get to a point
where, people getting it for

1609
00:50:19.727 --> 00:50:21.311
where, people getting it for
exercise in the minimum amount of

1610
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:22.936
exercise in the minimum amount of
time to flatten the curve, instead

1611
00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:23.352
time to ﬂatten the curve, instead
you suddenly

1612
00:50:23.352 --> 00:50:24.144
time to flatten the curve, instead
you suddenly have people spending a

1613
00:50:24.144 --> 00:50:24.519
you suddenly have peopla spending a
lot of

1614
00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:27.311
you suddenly have people spending a
lot of time outside sitting down.

1615
00:50:27.311 --> 00:50:29.102
lot of time outside sitting down.
It’s getting the balance right,

1616
00:50:29.102 --> 00:50:30.644
It’s getting the balance right,
which is why we are trying to do

1617
00:50:30.644 --> 00:50:32.477
which is why we are trying to do
this in a way where we ask people to

1618
00:50:32.477 --> 00:50:32.561
this in a way where we ask peopla to
use

1619
00:50:32.561 --> 00:50:34.102
this in a way where we ask people to
use common sense and follow the

1620
00:50:34.102 --> 00:50:35.894
use common sense and follow the
guidelines in a really sensible way

1621
00:50:35.894 --> 00:50:37.436
guidelines in a really sensible way
that is thinking of others.

1622
00:50:37.436 --> 00:50:41.102
that is thinking of others.
Actually, as I said, at the core is

1623
00:50:41.102 --> 00:50:42.852
Actually, as I said, at the core is
thinking about people on the front

1624
00:50:42.852 --> 00:50:43.144
thinking about peopla on the front
line

1625
00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:44.727
thinking about people on the front
line because, every time you follow

1626
00:50:44.727 --> 00:50:46.269
line because, every time you follow
the stay home wherever you can other

1627
00:50:46.269 --> 00:50:46.602
the stay home wherever you ran other
than that

1628
00:50:46.602 --> 00:50:49.686
the stay home wherever you can other
than that bit of exercise or, if you

1629
00:50:49.686 --> 00:50:51.894
than that bit of exercise or, if you
have to get to work, following the

1630
00:50:51.894 --> 00:50:53.311
have to get to work, following the
social distancing and guidelines,

1631
00:50:53.311 --> 00:50:54.644
social distancing and guidelines,
you are playing your part in saving

1632
00:50:54.644 --> 00:50:58.519
you are playing your part in saving
a life and helping the NHS. If you

1633
00:50:58.519 --> 00:50:59.936
a life and helping the NHS. If you
are going outside, could you look at

1634
00:50:59.936 --> 00:51:06.977
are going outside, could you look at
other people? That also creates that

1635
00:51:06.977 --> 00:51:07.936
other people? That also creates that
oxytocin, what we were talking

1636
00:51:07.936 --> 00:51:09.852
oxytocin, what we were talking
about, the bonding chemical. Can we

1637
00:51:09.852 --> 00:51:10.436
about, the bonding chemical. (“an we
not start making

1638
00:51:10.436 --> 00:51:11.477
about, the bonding chemical. Can we
not start making eye contact, even

1639
00:51:11.477 --> 00:51:15.061
not start making eye contact, even
if you are 12 feet away? Everybody

1640
00:51:15.061 --> 00:51:16.852
if you are 12 feet away? Everybody
has to do a little inch and then the

1641
00:51:16.852 --> 00:51:18.061
has to do a little inch and then the
world starts to have a ripple

1642
00:51:18.061 --> 00:51:19.686
world starts to have a rippla
effect.

1643
00:51:19.686 --> 00:51:21.727
world starts to have a ripple
effect. If you can pass a goodwill

1644
00:51:21.727 --> 00:51:22.102
effect. If you ran pass a goodwill
on to

1645
00:51:22.102 --> 00:51:23.311
effect. If you can pass a goodwill
on to somebody, however you do it,

1646
00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:23.936
on to somebody, however you do it,
open the door

00:51:26.311 --> 00:51:27.269
open the door for somebody,
gradually the world gets more

1650
00:51:27.269 --> 00:51:31.102
gradually the world gets more
conscious. Can I say one more thing?

1651
00:51:31.102 --> 00:51:31.686
conscious. (“an I say one more thing?
If anybody out

when I’m out for my exercise, people

when I’m out for my exercise, people
are not looking other people in the

1661
00:51:47.936 --> 00:51:49.769
are not looking other people in the
eye, because we are all trying to

eye, because we are all trying to
keep our distance so we are looking

Ruby is right, we should smile at
each other when we are passing, you

1675

00:52:23.602 --> 00:52:28.811
have got. Most peopla want to do the
right thing.

1685
00:52:32.519 --> 00:52:33.436
Some people some of these stories

1686
00:52:33.436 --> 00:52:33.894
Some peopla some of these stories
about hosting

1687
00:52:33.894 --> 00:52:36.936
Some people some of these stories
about hosting parties last weekend,

1688
00:52:36.936 --> 00:52:38.602
about hosting parties last weekend,
these things are totally

1689
00:52:38.602 --> 00:52:41.102
these things are totally
irresponsible, to invite people to

1690
00:52:41.102 --> 00:52:43.352
irresponsible, to invite people to
your house, or to congregate in

1691
00:52:43.352 --> 00:52:43.561
your house, or to congregate in
EWUPS-

1692
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:45.144
your house, or to congregate in
groups, because as Brendan says, it

1693
00:52:45.144 --> 00:52:47.394
groups, because as Brendan says, it
is going to put more pressure on the

1694
00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:48.727
is going to put more pressure on the
NHS and prolong the lockdown for all

1695
00:52:48.727 --> 00:52:51.977
NHS and prolong the lockdown for all
of us. The more we can do to abide

1696
00:52:51.977 --> 00:52:53.102
of us. The more we ran do to abide
by the mles and

1697
00:52:53.102 --> 00:52:53.977
of us. The more we can do to abide
by the rules and only go out when

1698
00:52:53.977 --> 00:52:55.269
by the mles and only go out when
needed... I

1699
00:52:55.269 --> 00:52:55.894
by the rules and only go out when
needed... I think it’s important

1700
00:52:55.894 --> 00:52:58.102
needed... I think it’s important
that people can exercise and I

1701
00:52:58.102 --> 00:53:00.519
that people can exercise and I
wouldn’t like to see those freedoms

1702
00:53:00.519 --> 00:53:02.144
wouldn’t like to see those freedoms
curtailed. It is more strict in some

1703
00:53:02.144 --> 00:53:05.311
curtailed. It is more strict in some
countries. This is the point, unless

1704
00:53:05.311 --> 00:53:07.686
countries. This is the point, unless
we stick with the rules we’ve got,

1705
00:53:07.686 --> 00:53:08.936
we stick with the mles we’ve got,
therll have

1706
00:53:08.936 --> 00:53:09.686
we stick with the rules we’ve got,
they’ll have to be tightened, to

1707
00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:10.894
therll have to be tightened, to
everyone’s

1708
00:53:10.894 --> 00:53:12.519
they’ll have to be tightened, to
everyone’s detriment. That is to

1709
00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:12.686
everyone’s detriment. That is to
encourage

1710
00:53:12.686 --> 00:53:14.311
everyone’s detriment. That is to
encourage everyone to do the right

1711
00:53:14.311 --> 00:53:16.227
encourage everyone to do the right
thing, this weekend and in the weeks

1712
00:53:16.227 --> 00:53:17.477
thing, this weekend and in the weeks
ahead because that will ease the

1713
00:53:17.477 --> 00:53:22.852
ahead because that will ease the
pressure on the add NHS, save lives,

1714
00:53:22.852 --> 00:53:24.519
pressure on the add NHS, save lives,
and mean we can come out of this

1715
00:53:24.519 --> 00:53:25.519
and mean we ran come out of this
sooner

1716
00:53:25.519 --> 00:53:26.977
and mean we can come out of this
sooner than if people carried on as

1717
00:53:26.977 --> 00:53:27.352
sooner than if peopla carried on as
if it’s

1718
00:53:27.352 --> 00:53:32.102
sooner than if people carried on as
if it’s business as usual. Peter? It

1719
00:53:32.102 --> 00:53:33.061
if it’s business as usual. Peter? It
must seem

1720
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:34.227
if it’s business as usual. Peter? It
must seem irrational or punitive.

1721
00:53:34.227 --> 00:53:35.561
must seem irrational or punitive.
It’s important that people

1722
00:53:35.561 --> 00:53:36.727
It’s important that people
understand when they are

1723
00:53:36.727 --> 00:53:37.186
It’s important that people
understand when they are following

1724
00:53:37.186 --> 00:53:38.602
understand when they are following
the science and doing things which

1725
00:53:38.602 --> 00:53:41.686
the science and doing things which
are not going to promote infection.

1726
00:53:41.686 --> 00:53:43.102
are not going to promote infection.
I can’t see what’s wrong with

1727
00:53:43.102 --> 00:53:44.644
I can’t see what’s wrong with
sitting down and taking a bit of

1728
00:53:44.644 --> 00:53:49.561
sitting down and taking a bit of
sun. The sun is very bad for the

1729
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:50.769
sun. The sun is very bad for the
virus, damaging its genetic

1730
00:53:50.769 --> 00:53:52.311
virus, damaging its genetic
material. That sounds like a fair

1731
00:53:52.311 --> 00:53:56.686
material. That sounds like a fair
enough thing to do. Brandon? I think

1732
00:53:56.686 --> 00:53:57.102
enough thing to do. Brandon? I think
peopla should

1733
00:53:57.102 --> 00:53:59.311
enough thing to do. Brandon? I think
people should be getting exercise.

1734
00:53:59.311 --> 00:54:02.061
people should be getting exercise.
What are we to make of that? People

1735
00:54:02.061 --> 00:54:02.394
what are we to make of that? People
talking about

1736
00:54:02.394 --> 00:54:04.811
What are we to make of that? People
talking about sitting down. I get

1737
00:54:04.811 --> 00:54:06.936
talking about sitting down. I get
the logic of what he’s saying. The

1738
00:54:06.936 --> 00:54:09.311
the logic of what he’s saying. The
reason we are saying not to hang

1739
00:54:09.311 --> 00:54:11.019
reason we are saying not to hang
around or go sunbathing in places is

1740
00:54:11.019 --> 00:54:14.352
around or go sunbathing in places is
because when one or two people do

1741
00:54:14.352 --> 00:54:16.977
because when one or two people do
it... I represent a seaside resort.

1742
00:54:16.977 --> 00:54:18.936
it... I represent a seaside resort.
If people come to the bench and they

1743
00:54:18.936 --> 00:54:19.936
If people come to the bench and they
are relaxing and sunbathing we’ll

1744
00:54:19.936 --> 00:54:22.144
are relaxing and sunbathing we’ll
end up with the same number on the

1745
00:54:22.144 --> 00:54:24.144
end up with the same number on the
beach as we do during the peak

1746
00:54:24.144 --> 00:54:27.269
beach as we do during the peak
Easter. We cannot have that. We have

1747
00:54:27.269 --> 00:54:28.977
Easter. We rannot have that. We have
to say to people,

1748
00:54:28.977 --> 00:54:29.352
Easter. We cannot have that. We have
to say to people, get exercise,

1749
00:54:29.352 --> 00:54:31.269
to say to people, get exercise,
follow social distancing but apart

1750
00:54:31.269 --> 00:54:33.311
follow social distancing but apart
from that, please stay at home. It

1751
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:35.352
from that, please stay at home. It
will mean that we can come through

1752
00:54:35.352 --> 00:54:35.936
will mean that we ran come through
this and enjoy

1753
00:54:35.936 --> 00:54:37.394
will mean that we can come through
this and enjoy our sunbathing later

1754
00:54:37.394 --> 00:54:39.269
this and enjoy our sunbathing later
this year, or next year, and the NHS

1755
00:54:39.269 --> 00:54:40.186
this year, or next year, and the NHS
ran get us to that

1756
00:54:40.186 --> 00:54:40.936
this year, or next year, and the NHS
can get us to that point. The

1757
00:54:40.936 --> 00:54:41.269
ran get us to that point. The
messages

1758
00:54:41.269 --> 00:54:42.894
can get us to that point. The
messages you can go outside but you

1759
00:54:42.894 --> 00:54:43.436
messages you ran go outside but you
have to keep

1760
00:54:43.436 --> 00:54:45.144
messages you can go outside but you
have to keep on the move? Unless

1761
00:54:45.144 --> 00:54:48.019
have to keep on the move? Unless
you’re going to work, have the

1762
00:54:48.019 --> 00:54:48.977
you’re going to work, have the
exercise, that’s the important part

1763
00:54:48.977 --> 00:54:52.977
exercise, that’s the important part
for mental health, but that’s what

1764
00:54:52.977 --> 00:54:54.311
for mental health, but that’s what
it’s for. Especially this weekend

1765
00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:55.936
it’s for. Especially this weekend
when it will be tempting. And very

1766
00:54:55.936 --> 00:54:59.519
when it will be tempting. And very
warm. I think we’ve got some

1767
00:54:59.519 --> 00:55:00.561
warm. I think we’ve got some
clarity. Our

1768
00:55:00.561 --> 00:55:00.727
warm. I think we’ve got some
clarity. Ourtime

1769
00:55:00.727 --> 00:55:01.144
warm. I think we’ve got some
clarity. Our time is up,

1770
00:55:01.144 --> 00:55:01.352
warm. I think we’ve got some
clarity. Ourtime is up, I’m

1771
00:55:01.352 --> 00:55:01.602
warm. I think we’ve got some
clarity. Our time is up, I’m afraid.

1772
00:55:01.602 --> 00:55:03.894
clarity. Our time is up, I’m afraid.
We could talk about this for some

1773
00:55:03.894 --> 00:55:06.019
We could talk about this for some
time. Question Time will be back

1774
00:55:06.019 --> 00:55:10.186
time. Question Time will be back
next week, at 8pm on BBC One.

1808
00:56:55.852 --> 00:56:59.936
My mum, she’s like this mix of being
super—strict, but really shy.

1809
00:56:59.936 --> 00:57:03.019
Full of madheads in here.
And my dad, he’s really sweet.

1810
00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:05.102
GLASS SMASHES
where’s my keys! ?

1811
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:07.561
0h, they sound lush.

1812
00:57:07.561 --> 00:57:09.936
A little bending of the truth
never hurt anyone, did it?

1813
00:57:09.936 --> 00:57:11.269
What?

1814
00:57:11.269 --> 00:57:15.227
The forecast is black ice
and you are on slippery skis.

1815
00:57:18.436 --> 00:57:19.936
CAR HORN BLASTS
Get out of the way!

1816
00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:22.561
Just leave it, it doesn’t matter.
It does matter, Lydia.

1817
00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:27.061
I’m sorry. Never apologise to me,
OK? I’m your daughter.

BBC Three’s new comedy drama...

1819

All episodes streaming now.

1820
00:58:10.269 --> 00:58:14.102
This programme contains
some strong language

1821
00:58:14.102 --> 00:58:16.352
They say his deaths a suicide.
What if he was murdered?

1822
00:58:16.352 --> 00:58:18.311
By speaking out against your father,

1823
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:20.394
Yaro is forfeiting any money
he was promised.

1824
00:58:20.394 --> 00:58:23.686
Our priority no longer lies
in the appeasement of Noughts.

1825
00:58:23.686 --> 00:58:25.561
It’s time we regained order.

1826
00:58:25.561 --> 00:58:27.727
All I’m asking is that you
meet with Dorn.

1827
00:58:29.186 --> 00:58:30.227
You’ll find it here.

1828
00:58:31.269 --> 00:58:32.894
Truth sometimes comes at a cost.

1829
00:58:36.852 --> 00:58:39.061
I can’t love you —
not with who I am —

1830
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:41.227
or where I’m going.

1831
00:58:41.227 --> 00:58:42.269

1841
00:59:10.769 --> 00:59:12.977
and the minds of the nation.

1842
00:59:12.977 --> 00:59:13.977
ALL: Yes!

1843
00:59:13.977 --> 00:59:16.102
So, to us...

01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:07.352
Come on. Leave him — that’s enough.

1851
01:00:08.894 --> 01:00:10.186
Let’s go.

1852
01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.102
