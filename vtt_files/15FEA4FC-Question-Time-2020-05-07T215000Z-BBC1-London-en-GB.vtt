00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:26.360
Welcome very much to our panellists
here, and of course toJuergen

20
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.526
and Nick, who arejoining us
down the line.

21
00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:29.943
You know the score by now.

22
00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.610
We have no physical audience
here in the studio.

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.860
But this week’s pre—recorded
questions come from Newcastle,

24
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.068
which is where we were intending
to be before all of this happened.

25
00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.276
And we’ll be taking a couple
of questions live as well tonight.

26
00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:45.693
And as usual of course we’ve been
hearing from you at home via social

27
00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:48.276
media, and if you want to keep
on feeding your questions

28
00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:53.026
and your comments in, contact us
on social media, @bbcquestiontime.

29
00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:55.735
I’ll get them on this tablet
here and I’ll feed those

30
00:01:55.735 --> 00:01:57.735
in to the panel as we go along.

31
00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:00.401
So let’s take our first question
tonight, and we arejoined

32
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:01.443
by Margaret Collins.

33
00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:02.568
Margaret, good evening.

34
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:05.276
Good evening.

35
00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:07.818
I have many questions
concerning our Government’s

36
00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:10.568
handling of the coronavirus,
but this morning I read,

37
00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:14.318
according to statistics
from John Hopkins University,

38
00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:18.818
Sweden has 28 deaths
per 100,000 inhabitants.

39
00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:23.860
Norway has four deaths
per 100,000 inhabitants.

40
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.818
Denmark has 8.7, Finland has 4.5.

41
00:02:28.818 --> 00:02:33.818
Even the USA has less
than the UK, at 21.7.

42
00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:38.276
So they are all lower than the UK,
which has a nationwide lockdown,

43
00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:42.901
and the toll is significantly
higher, at 44.1; per

44
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.693
100,000 inhabitants.

45
00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:49.110
My question is why and how did
the Government let this happen

46
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.776
when we had advanced warning
of the figures coming

47
00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:57.068
out of other countries?

48
00:02:57.068 --> 00:03:02.026
As a country, we are meant to be
celebrating VE Day tomorrow,

49
00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:04.401
but who feels like celebrating?

50
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.318
I don’t feel particularly
proud of being British

51
00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.776
when I see figures like that.

52
00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:09.068
Chris, let’s start with you.

53
00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:11.860
Well, the death rate
is clearly very concerning.

54
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.193
And we can talk about numbers
but behind each individual number

55
00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:18.110
there is a personal tragedy for both
the individual concerned but also

56
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.901
their relatives and families.

57
00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.318
But what do you think
when you hear Margaret list

58
00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:24.401
those numbers like that?

59
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.401
Well, it’s very concerning.

60
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:28.818
If you look at the levels
of mortality that we

61
00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:29.860
have in this country.

62
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.693
I do think, though, when I talk
to my public health colleagues,

63
00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:35.610
what they say to me is,
"Just be very careful about making

64
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.985
international comparisons at this
point," because there are a number

65
00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.026
of different reasons as to why
different countries may have

66
00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.485
different death rates.

67
00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:45.360
For example, there isn’t
a single universal way

68
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
of recording coronavirus...

69
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.193
I get that, and obviously that’s
something the Government have

70
00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:54.443
been very keen to say.

71
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:59.485
But, nonetheless, whether we are
the worst in Europe,

72
00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:06.360
we’ve got the highest death toll
in Europe or the second

73
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.276
highest rate in Europe,
maybe even the third,

74
00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:10.235
it’s not where anyone
would want to be.

75
00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.151
And Margaret’s question
is why has this happened?

76
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.985
What’s your view, given your
at the coal face with the ambulance

77
00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:16.235
workers and the hospital workers?

78
00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:18.610
Well, quite rightly, Margaret wants
an answer to that question,

79
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.818
given the level we’re at.

80
00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:23.360
The reality is we are going to have
to wait to do the real detailed

81
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360
analysis to find out
what has happened here.

82
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.943
And I think, as I said,
it’s dangerous, and that’s certainly

83
00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:30.110
what our public health expert
colleagues say, to draw

84
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.151
conclusions at this point.

85
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:34.818
But, clearly, with 30,000 deaths,
it is a real issue.

86
00:04:34.818 --> 00:04:36.943
I think there are some
conclusions we can draw.

87
00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:41.943
I’m not party to the intelligence
and information that the Government

88
00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:49.401
has but I remember in February two
local schools where I live

89
00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:51.568
in south London were closed
because of coronavirus outbreaks

90
00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:52.985
and concerns of the
infection spreading.

91
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:54.901
By then, other countries
were already implementing lockdown

92
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:57.068
measures, and it was weeks
before our Government started

93
00:04:57.068 --> 00:04:58.110
to take this seriously.

94
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.943
And I think that Margaret’s
question, which is a really sad one

95
00:05:00.943 --> 00:05:03.651
and an honest one to hear,
has kind of two components.

96
00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:05.818
One, why has the Government
handled it this way?

97
00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:07.235
Why has everything taken so long?

98
00:05:07.235 --> 00:05:09.651
Why do we always feel
like we’re playing catch up

99
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:10.693
on PPE, lockdown measures?

100
00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:12.860
And then the second component
is the Government’s tone.

101
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.818
Because, for me, to hear our
Government congratulating

102
00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:18.151
itself on the way it’s
handled this outbreak...

103
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.443
So BorisJohnson called
it "Our apparent success.

104
00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:24.068
It’s insulting to the people
who continue to die every day,

105
00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:26.943
and what I would like to see
is honesty from the Government,

106
00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:28.651
acknowledging that this
was not well handled,

107
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.735
that mistakes have been made,
and telling us clearly

108
00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:32.818
and transparently what they intend
to do differently.

109
00:05:32.818 --> 00:05:35.735
Because at the moment the gulf
between what we are experiencing,

110
00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.068
the number of people who are dying,
the heartbreaking scenarios

111
00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:41.193
of people dying alone,
often in unnecessary circumstances

112
00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:43.818
because we haven’t got a grip
on this, and the Government’s

113
00:05:43.818 --> 00:05:46.401
rhetoric is only losing further
tmst.

114
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:49.485
And I think trust is important right
now, and until the Government show

115
00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:52.151
some honesty and integrity we can’t
even begin to see how

116
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.818
we can move forward.

117
00:05:53.818 --> 00:05:58.776
And, Juergen, I saw
you were nodding at that?

118
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.235
Well, yeah, I think Margaret’s
question is absolutely spot on,

119
00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:09.901
and what you said in your question,
Margaret, is that we

120
00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:10.985
didn’t plan ahead.

121
00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:14.110
So we are managing this
in the here and now and that makes

122
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.860
managing a crisis like this
unbelievably difficult,

123
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.193
and I think we should say a huge
thank—you to all of the people

124
00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:22.318
who are doing that, but what should
have happened is we should have

125
00:06:22.318 --> 00:06:24.110
spent much more time
planning early on.

126
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.776
And we saw the signs from Italy,
and we knew that we had to put

127
00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:31.568
testing capacity in place,
and we didn’t do that early enough.

128
00:06:31.568 --> 00:06:34.735
And we didn’t lock down fast enough.

129
00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:38.401
You know, there should have been
a hard, fast lockdown.

130
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:40.776
And, in hindsight, we know that
would have been better,

131
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:43.985
but we didn’t plan well enough
ahead, I’m afraid.

132
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:47.193
It is interesting,
because in February the UK

133
00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:49.610
was ranked second best placed
to deal with a pandemic.

134
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.776
This was by the Global
Health Security Index.

135
00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:54.193
Margaret saying, "How has
the Government let it happen

136
00:06:54.193 --> 00:06:56.901
where we have a death toll
as we have?"

137
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.735
Nick?

138
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:03.776
Well, it clearly isn’t a reason
for celebration, Fiona.

139
00:07:03.776 --> 00:07:06.526
It’s an extraordinary
tragedy for our country,

140
00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:11.526
and a tragedy for each and every
family, and to see that figure today

141
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.485
of over 30,600 deaths
was startling, and shocking.

142
00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:19.610
So what did you think
when the Prime Minister described

143
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.985
it, talked about our response
to the pandemic as our

144
00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:24.651
apparent success?

145
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:28.401
Well, it’s not a success
or an apparent success, Fiona,

146
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:32.110
and throughout this crisis we have
quite rightly supported

147
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.068
the Government in its aim
of minimising loss of life.

148
00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:38.776
But we’ve also called out things
when we thought the Government

149
00:07:38.776 --> 00:07:41.860
wasn’t acting quite the way that it
should, and there are questions

150
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.235
about how well—prepared the country
was for this particular

151
00:07:46.235 --> 00:07:48.735
type of pandemic.

152
00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:52.526
But we were also slow in lockdown,
slow in terms of a comprehensive

153
00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:56.610
testing and tracing strategy,
and there have been significant

154
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.860
problems between what the Government
has said is available,

155
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.068
in terms of personal
protective equipment,

156
00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:08.068
and what has actually got
to the front line...

157
00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:13.693
And you say that the
Government was...

158
00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:14.735
Sorry, cutting across you.

159
00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:17.360
You say the Government was too slow
in introducing the lockdown.

160
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.818
Was Labour calling for the lockdown
to be introduced earlier?

161
00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:22.818
Yes, yes, absolutely, Fiona,
and I was there are actually

162
00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:26.110
in the House of Commons on the 23rd
of March and we actually called

163
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.776
for the lockdown in the House
of Commons prior to it

164
00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:31.943
being announced later that day.

165
00:08:31.943 --> 00:08:36.943
And I think that was something
we raised on the floor

166
00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:38.526
of the House that day.

167
00:08:38.526 --> 00:08:39.985
But what about earlier than that?

168
00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.151
Because that was obviouslyjust
a few hours earlier.

169
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:44.526
If you’re saying the Government
was too late in introducing

170
00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:46.901
a lockdown, presumably you don’t
mean by a few hours.

171
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.318
I don’t really recall that,
but maybe I missed it,

172
00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:51.735
Labour calling for a lockdown
in February, say, for example?

173
00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:52.818
No...

174
00:08:52.818 --> 00:08:55.651
Well, listen, what we’ve tried to do
throughout this crisis

175
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:57.443
is to be supportive,
Fiona.

176
00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.860
You ask me about when we
called for a lockdown.

177
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.235
I was set in the House of Commons
on the day that we did,

178
00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:06.151
but the point that I’m making,
really, is that of course

179
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:10.526
we will come to a point
in the future when we must look very

180
00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:15.526
robustly, with great scrutiny,
as to what the Government did

181
00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:20.026
and what differently it could have
done throughout this crisis.

182
00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:23.610
We have to answer that question
as to why we’ve ended up with this

183
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.235
tragic death toll as we have.

184
00:09:25.235 --> 00:09:27.401
But at the same time
we can’t simply say,

185
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.318
"This is something for the future."

186
00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:32.860
I hope the Government is learning
lessons as it is going along

187
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.443
on the issues of testing
and tracing, on the issues

188
00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:38.318
of personal protective equipment,
to try to minimise loss

189
00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:40.776
of life going forward.

190
00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:42.860
George, apparent success.

191
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.735
Is that how you describe it?

192
00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:47.860
Well, look, what the Prime Minister
was describing there is what we have

193
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.485
all done as a country,
people who have stayed at home,

194
00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:53.693
observed social distancing,
ourfabulous NHS, and everybody else

195
00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:56.110
who has responded to this crisis.

196
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.193
who has responded to this crisis.

197
00:09:56.193 --> 00:09:58.860
That is all to save lives,
and we now have this

198
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.860
terrible death toll.

199
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.985
Yeah, we are in an extraordinary
time and it is right to acknowledge

200
00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:05.401
the steps everyone has taken,
and that’s all the Prime

201
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:06.443
Minister was doing.

202
00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:09.568
Look, I think the point I’d say
here, it’s very difficult to make

203
00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:11.276
these international comparisons,
because different countries are

204
00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:12.443
recording deaths in different ways.

205
00:10:12.443 --> 00:10:13.651
Different countries have
different circumstances.

206
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:16.318
London is a huge city with a big
public transport system.

207
00:10:16.318 --> 00:10:18.651
That could have had
an impact early on.

208
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.526
There will be a time
and a place to reflect

209
00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:23.651
and learn lessons from it.

210
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.568
But...

211
00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:27.943
Now we are dealing with
this epidemic and we...

212
00:10:27.943 --> 00:10:30.818
What is interesting
about that is I’ve watched everyone,

213
00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:33.943
as you would expect in this job,
every one of the press conferences

214
00:10:33.943 --> 00:10:38.610
at five o’clock since this started,
and at the beginning in the first

215
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.985
month or so when you are showing
those international comparisons

216
00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:43.860
there was no reference to the fact
that those comparisons might be

217
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.151
a bit dodgy when we were below
the other European countries.

218
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:50.318
Now that we are above them
the Government is very keen to point

219
00:10:50.318 --> 00:10:52.276
out that we shouldn’t be
making these comparisons.

220
00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.735
You never said that early on.

221
00:10:53.735 --> 00:10:55.151
Well, we weren’t making comparisons.

222
00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:57.318
We’ve always tracked the death
rates that have been

223
00:10:57.318 --> 00:10:59.276
recorded in all countries.

224
00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:04.235
So you didn’t warn us of them.

225
00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:09.943
We’ve tried to follow the advice
of the Chief Medical Officer

226
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.526
and Chief scientific advisor,
and the belief all along,

227
00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:16.151
which I think was correct,
is that we were roughly two,

228
00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:18.110
three weeks behind countries
like Italy and France.

229
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.526
We were on a different trajectory.

230
00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:21.151
That’s why it wasn’t
appropriate to lockdown

231
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:23.860
at the point that they did,
but it’s not true that

232
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.860
we weren’t prepared.

233
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.235
There were all sorts of Cobra
meetings and planning meetings

234
00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:32.276
taking place on this right
from January onwards.

235
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:34.318
ii

236
00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:38.401
It was occupying all Matt Hancock’s
time. Lots of planning and

237
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:39.943
time. Lots of planning and
preparation went into responding to

238
00:11:39.943 --> 00:11:41.860
preparation went into responding to
this, but it was the case that the

239
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.235
this, but it was the rase that the
scientific

240
00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:43.276
this, but it was the case that the
scientific advice was not that we

241
00:11:43.276 --> 00:11:44.860
scientific advice was not that we
should have locked down earlier than

242
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.860
should have locked down eartier than
we did and,

243
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.818
should have locked down earlier than
we did and, as soon as the advice

244
00:11:46.818 --> 00:11:48.193
we did and, as soon as the advice
was that we should lockdown, that’s

245
00:11:48.193 --> 00:11:51.360
was that we should lockdown, that’s
what we did. This is what I mean by

246
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.193
what we did. This is what I mean by
honesty. The government has been

247
00:11:53.193 --> 00:11:58.235
honesty. The government has been
changing its narrative to fit its

248
00:11:58.235 --> 00:11:59.360
changing its narrative to fit its
results so, initially, we liked

249
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.151
results so, initially, we liked
international comparisons because

250
00:12:00.151 --> 00:12:02.401
international comparisons because
they made us look good but, now they

251
00:12:02.401 --> 00:12:04.485
they made us look good but, now they
make us look bad, we can’t trust

252
00:12:04.485 --> 00:12:07.443
make us look bad, we can’t trust
them. The advice on PPE was to use

253
00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:09.443
them. The advice on PPE was to use
the equipment recommended by the WHO

254
00:12:09.443 --> 00:12:10.860
the equipment recommended by the WHO
until it emerged we didn’t have it

255
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.193
until it emerged we didn’t have it
and then the advice was changed. The

256
00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:14.860
and then the advice was changed. The
definition of testing was changed

257
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.943
definition of testing was changed
when it emerged we couldn’t meet

258
00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:19.568
the 100 tests.

259
00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:22.485
and then the PPE advice was changed
to fit what we have.

260
00:12:22.485 --> 00:12:24.651
The definition of testing
was changed when it emerged

261
00:12:24.651 --> 00:12:27.276
we couldn’t meet the 100,000 tests
a day standard we promised

262
00:12:27.276 --> 00:12:29.860
until we suddenly could by changing
what counts as a test,

263
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.818
test having been sent out rather
than a result having been received.

264
00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:35.193
And for those of us
who are not medical experts,

265
00:12:35.193 --> 00:12:38.318
who are just members of the public
watching people we know and love

266
00:12:38.318 --> 00:12:40.943
die, there is an unavoidable feeling
that the Government is not

267
00:12:40.943 --> 00:12:43.360
being honest with us
about the scale of the crisis.

268
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.235
Yes, we’ve all done everything
we can to try and mitigate this,

269
00:12:46.235 --> 00:12:48.651
and we are all trying to come
together and help.

270
00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:50.068
That doesn’t make this a success.

271
00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:52.485
That makes us people
who are suffering and doing our

272
00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:54.860
absolute best, in circumstances
where we can’t help but feel

273
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.943
that the leadership has failed us,
and I think we deserve an honest

274
00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:59.026
acknowledgement of that.

275
00:12:59.026 --> 00:13:01.443
Well, it’s simply not true that
there’s been, you know,

276
00:13:01.443 --> 00:13:02.610
dishonesty or anything on this.

277
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.026
From the very beginning, we’ve been
holding daily press conferences.

278
00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:07.443
The Chief Medical Officer has been
attending many of those.

279
00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:10.276
And they’ve been very, very candid
about the nature of this crisis,

280
00:13:10.276 --> 00:13:13.193
the reasons we are doing the things
we are doing, and very

281
00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.360
candid about the evidence
and the epidemiology behind it,

282
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.235
so we’ve been I think as frank
as possible with the public,

283
00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:20.151
and we’ve shared with all
of ourthinking...

284
00:13:20.151 --> 00:13:21.610
So when the Health Secretary said...

285
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.985
I think the bit that does
need to be recognised

286
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:27.360
here is if you wind back to ten,
12 weeks, and we were looking

287
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.235
at what had happened in northern
Italy, where their health system had

288
00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:32.360
been completely overwhelmed,
and we had the awful prospect

289
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.818
of people turning up to hospitals
and simply not being

290
00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:35.860
able to be treated.

291
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.693
And I think the bit that we do need
to recognise is that the NHS has

292
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:41.860
actually created 33,000 beds
to treat coronavirus patients, we’ve

293
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.651
created seven Nightingale hospitals,
literally within the space

294
00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:46.818
of a fortnight...

295
00:13:46.818 --> 00:13:48.943
It’s not worked quite
so well with the care

296
00:13:48.943 --> 00:13:50.026
sector, though, has it?

297
00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:51.735
No, absolutely, we recognise...

298
00:13:51.735 --> 00:13:54.401
I think everybody in the health
and care system recognises it

299
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:56.568
has not worked so well
in the care homes.

300
00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:59.693
But all I’m saying is if you look
at that prospect, the NHS

301
00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:02.776
was really clearly told,
"You have to do everything to avoid

302
00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:05.860
that overwhelm," and I think the bit
that we do need to recognise,

303
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.943
because it’s due to the hard effort
of the million front line staff,

304
00:14:08.943 --> 00:14:11.360
is that we have managed
to avoid that overwhelm.

305
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.235
And, as I said, it’s very
difficult in a sense to kind

306
00:14:14.235 --> 00:14:16.651
of talk about celebration
when we are talking about this

307
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:18.985
in the context of 30,000 dead,
but we should recognise...

308
00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:21.276
But why do you think...

309
00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:24.151
I mean, George is saying we did
everything at the right time.

310
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:26.568
The lockdown was done
at the right time.

311
00:14:26.568 --> 00:14:29.068
Why do you think, then,
if that is true, not

312
00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:32.276
according to you, Afua,
why do you think we have

313
00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:34.151
so many deaths, then?

314
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:37.026
Well, I think it’s really difficult
to tell at this point here.

315
00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:40.151
And, as I said, I know that people,
quite rightly, want the answers,

316
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:41.860
but there are potentially
lots of reasons.

317
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.360
If you look at population density,
that is clearly one.

318
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.526
I think you raise, quite correctly,
the fact that our social care sector

319
00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:50.276
has been completely neglected
and we know that what happens

320
00:14:50.276 --> 00:14:55.068
in a crisis is that the crisis
inevitably finds the weakest link

321
00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:57.485
in terms of the area that’s been
underinvested in that

322
00:14:57.485 --> 00:14:58.901
hasn’t been sorted out.

323
00:14:58.901 --> 00:15:02.776
So there are some reasons, I’m sure,
but all I’m saying is we need to be

324
00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:05.151
careful aboutjumping to immediate
conclusions on the basis of,

325
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:09.568
to be frank, incomplete
evidence at this point.

326
00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:12.151
Nick, oh, sorry, yes.

327
00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:17.110
You know, all this discussion about
comparisons and "We are not sure".

328
00:15:25.443 --> 00:15:28.526
I mean, I think the data is good
enough for us to say

329
00:15:28.526 --> 00:15:30.735
that a country like ours,
like Britain, with all

330
00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.610
of its capability,
we should have done better.

331
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.860
We should be doing better.

332
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.985
There is no doubt
about that in my mind.

333
00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:38.360
And I think in terms
of the planning, and I’d

334
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.568
like to come back to this
point of testing.

335
00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:42.485
You know, we didn’t
plan ahead well enough.

336
00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:45.860
If we would have done we would have
had the tests of the 100,000

337
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.443
in place by the beginning of April,
not starting building it

338
00:15:48.443 --> 00:15:53.443
at the beginning of April.

339
00:15:56.735 --> 00:15:58.818
we’ve got a long way to go.

340
00:15:58.818 --> 00:16:01.776
We need to live and manage
the situation, and I do agree

341
00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:04.610
with Afua’s point that a bit
of honesty, a bit of learning,

342
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.943
so we can learn as we go
into the next phase and really make

343
00:16:07.943 --> 00:16:11.318
sure that we make a betterjob,
as we now try and exit out

344
00:16:11.318 --> 00:16:12.318
of this terrible situation.

345
00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:14.943
Nick, you had your hand up,
you want to come in.

346
00:16:14.943 --> 00:16:17.110
George is saying the Government has
been candid throughout.

347
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.151
Do you feel that?

348
00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:24.901
Well, the Government
has been inconsistent,

349
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.151
not least around the issues
of testing and tracing.

350
00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:29.526
The lockdown was absolutely
essential, but it was a blunt

351
00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:31.693
instrument unless you had a testing
and tracing strategy.

352
00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:33.610
Now, the Government was actually
doing community testing

353
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.818
but it stopped doing that
on the 12th of March.

354
00:16:37.818 --> 00:16:39.901
Originally it was said
that was a policy decision,

355
00:16:39.901 --> 00:16:42.610
but more lately it seems it’s been
admitted that that was

356
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.610
because of a lack of capacity.

357
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:52.026
Now, it took weeks and weeks
after that for the Government

358
00:16:52.026 --> 00:16:54.735
to then start to actually ramp up
testing to the level

359
00:16:54.735 --> 00:16:59.693
that it needed to be at.

360
00:17:01.943 --> 00:17:04.860
But it’s not got to that yet,
and I’m afraid that hitting

361
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.943
the target on the 30th of April,
it seems that that was done

362
00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.860
by putting a number of tests
in the post without an actual

363
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.860
guarantee that those
tests had been used.

364
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.526
And we’ve seen the test
again falling below

365
00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:26.151
100,000 in recent days.

366
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:28.318
Now, that needs to be ramped up
again significantly,

367
00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:30.943
and it needs to be attached
to a proper tracing strategy.

368
00:17:30.943 --> 00:17:33.860
And that really has to be a focus
now for the Government

369
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.860
in the weeks ahead.

370
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.318
Let me come back to Margaret.

371
00:17:36.318 --> 00:17:38.735
Margaret, you’ve set here very
patiently and listened to that,

372
00:17:38.735 --> 00:17:39.943
and thank you for that.

373
00:17:39.943 --> 00:17:42.818
You said figures like the ones
you quoted don’t make you feel

374
00:17:42.818 --> 00:17:43.860
proud to be British.

375
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.985
What do you feel about
the responses you’ve heard?

376
00:17:45.985 --> 00:17:47.068
0h. . .
just disappointed.

377
00:17:47.068 --> 00:17:48.235
They haven’t really
answered anything.

378
00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:53.110
And I agree with some of the points.
We’ve got to wait and see.

379
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.526
However...

380
00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:55.776
So what would your question...

381
00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.693
We’ve got George Eustice
here from the Government.

382
00:17:57.693 --> 00:17:59.610
What would your question
be directly to him?

383
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.860
Why didn’t we have
testing, PPE earlier?

384
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.068
The Government must
have known about it.

385
00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:10.526
Well, we have ramped up testing
considerably, so we have...

386
00:18:10.526 --> 00:18:11.568
That’s not the question.

387
00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:13.693
The question is why didn’t
you have it earlier.

388
00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:16.068
Well, there are some countries that
had more diagnostic labs,

389
00:18:16.068 --> 00:18:18.735
so countries like Germany had a lot
of those diagnostic labs.

390
00:18:18.735 --> 00:18:22.110
We had to expand them from scratch.

391
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.485
And the Army had been involved
in this and did a fantasticjob.

392
00:18:24.485 --> 00:18:26.860
We’ve now got 90 mobile testing
units around the country,

393
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.860
50 drive through...

394
00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:33.943
But could you have
ramped it up earlier?

395
00:18:33.943 --> 00:18:35.651
I mean, there’s been
an enormous effort...

396
00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:38.776
They ramped it up as quickly
as they could, and we are now

397
00:18:38.776 --> 00:18:40.901
about 100,000 capacity and it’s
going to double again

398
00:18:40.901 --> 00:18:41.943
over the next month.

399
00:18:41.943 --> 00:18:43.651
We will be ramping it up further.

400
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:44.860
Margaret, does not satisfy you?

401
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.901
No.

402
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:47.068
I should see as well...

403
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:48.776
I’m full of praise for the NHS.

404
00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:49.985
I’m not criticising the NHS.

405
00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:51.693
I think they’ve done
a wonderfuljob.

406
00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:53.360
I’m criticising the Government’s
lack of preparedness.

407
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.318
0K.

408
00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:02.360
Well, listen, Margaret,
thank you very much for your

409
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.443
contribution this evening.

410
00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:04.610
Let’s take another question now.

411
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.860
Let’s talk to James Clancy.

412
00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.985
James, would you like to
give us your question?

413
00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:08.985
Yes.

414
00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:10.026
Good evening.

415
00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:12.526
One of the major issues that
will concern many viewers,

416
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:15.360
who will download the mobile app,
is our reluctance for the Government

417
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.735
to access our private data,
and all the privacy issues

418
00:19:17.735 --> 00:19:22.776
of using such data.

419
00:19:26.568 --> 00:19:29.401
For track, trace and quarantine
to be a success it is essential

420
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:32.318
that the Authorities have access
to our personal data, then they can

421
00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:35.401
track if we have caught the virus,
to pinpoint where we have been,

422
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.860
and who we’ve had contact with.

423
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.985
When measured against
what we have already lost —

424
00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:41.151
our freedom to socialise,
our future economic and job

425
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:43.818
prospects, not to mention
the potential danger to our health —

426
00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:47.151
does the panel feel it is a small
price to pay to share part

427
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:49.568
of our personal data to control
and quell this virus

428
00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:54.610
until the vaccine can be found?

429
00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:57.651
And, James, what do you think?

430
00:19:57.651 --> 00:19:59.818
Do you think it is
a price worth paying?

431
00:19:59.818 --> 00:20:03.110
I do think it’s a price worth
paying, but I also as well think

432
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.318
we should be doing more.

433
00:20:04.318 --> 00:20:07.485
We’ve got to help these tracers
to get at least a 70—90% success

434
00:20:07.485 --> 00:20:09.818
rate if track and tracing
is going to be successful.

435
00:20:09.818 --> 00:20:10.860
OK.
So, George...

436
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.860
So I think it’s a well...

437
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.526
That’s why I phrased
the question the way I did,

438
00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:25.860
because I think it is a price
well worth paying.

439
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.693
50, George, the app has launched...

440
00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:30.526
It has been trialled on the Isle
of Wight as of today.

441
00:20:30.526 --> 00:20:32.901
You obviously do think
it is a price worth paying,

442
00:20:32.901 --> 00:20:34.610
clearly, because that’s why
you’ve launched it.

443
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.985
Can you just explain
to us the detail of how

444
00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:38.068
it’s going to work?

445
00:20:38.068 --> 00:20:41.193
Say, for example, the app thatJames
is referring to, the tracing app,

446
00:20:41.193 --> 00:20:44.568
I get a ping on my phone saying I’ve
been in contact with someone

447
00:20:44.568 --> 00:20:46.235
who has reported symptoms
of the coronavirus.

448
00:20:46.235 --> 00:20:47.276
What happens then?

449
00:20:47.276 --> 00:20:52.235
So it’s been piloted, as you said,
on the Isle of Wight,

450
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.651
and the idea is that people will go
on to the app, they will enter their

451
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.068
phone number and their postcode —
and no other personal

452
00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:00.110
details, by the way.

453
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.985
And if their mobile phone
is in contact for a certain length

454
00:21:02.985 --> 00:21:07.985
of time, and that’s being trialled
in the pilot now, with mobile

455
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.776
phones in that area,
and that person subsequently shows

456
00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:17.401
symptoms and reports those symptoms
then those other people who have

457
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.526
been in close or regular contact
with that person will receive

458
00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:23.360
a notification to say that someone
who they were in close contact

459
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.401
with has reported symptoms.

460
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:29.360
And what should they then do?

461
00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:31.193
And they should then
self—isolate as well.

462
00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:33.818
What, for a fortnight?

463
00:21:33.818 --> 00:21:36.401
For...
That’s to be decided,

464
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:39.485
but I think two weeks is one
of the things that’s been said.

465
00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:40.526
And should they...

466
00:21:40.526 --> 00:21:42.735
And this is very powerful
once you get to...

467
00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:45.360
But hang on, wait a minute,
let’s understand how it works,

468
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.526
though, just to be clear.

469
00:21:46.526 --> 00:21:49.901
Because this is something that may
be coming the way of all of us.

470
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:53.026
So you get an alert on your phone
saying you’ve been in touch

471
00:21:53.026 --> 00:21:54.943
with someone who has reported
symptoms of coronavirus,

472
00:21:54.943 --> 00:21:56.151
you self—isolate for a fortnight.

473
00:21:56.151 --> 00:21:58.068
And then, what, yourfamily
has to self—isolate

474
00:21:58.068 --> 00:21:59.276
for a fortnight as well?

475
00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.193
These are details that
are being worked through,

476
00:22:01.193 --> 00:22:02.235
but, essentially...

477
00:22:02.235 --> 00:22:05.360
We don’t know yet?

478
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.526
We don’t know yet, no,
and this is why we are piloting it

479
00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:09.735
in the Isle of Wight.

480
00:22:09.735 --> 00:22:12.360
This could be very powerful once
you get to the point

481
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.401
as life starts to...

482
00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:16.776
But this bit must have been worked
out, because the people on the Isle

483
00:22:16.776 --> 00:22:18.151
of Wight are actually doing it.

484
00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:20.360
They must know what they
should do when they...

485
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:20.568
This

486
00:22:20.568 --> 00:22:21.610
Yes.
50...

487
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.651
They should isolate, yes.

488
00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:23.860
And members of theirfamily?

489
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.485
I think they should isolate
as well, as is the case

490
00:22:26.485 --> 00:22:27.693
if anybody has got symptoms.

491
00:22:27.693 --> 00:22:32.151
But if they don’t show symptoms then
obviously it a different matter.

492
00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:34.068
But this is quite powerful
because it means...

493
00:22:34.068 --> 00:22:35.068
Hang on, hang on.

494
00:22:35.068 --> 00:22:37.026
So they should self—isolate
if they have symptoms,

495
00:22:37.026 --> 00:22:38.735
but not if they don’t have symptoms?

496
00:22:38.735 --> 00:22:41.068
No, they should self—isolate
initially, but if they don’t have

497
00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:43.026
symptoms then obviously
they wouldn’t need to isolate

498
00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:44.068
for longer than that.

499
00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:49.068
Do they get tested?
Are they going to get tested?

500
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:51.276
These are things, though,
that we are working through.

501
00:22:51.276 --> 00:22:54.360
Yes, testing in conjunction
with this could be an option.

502
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.776
But these are details that
are being worked out.

503
00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.151
That’s why we are piloting it,
to work out precisely

504
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:01.193
how that would work.

505
00:23:01.193 --> 00:23:03.901
This could be very powerful, though,
because it will show us

506
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:06.318
where you get flare—ups
in particular parts of the country,

507
00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:11.318
because lots of people
will be reporting symptoms.

508
00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:25.693
So we’ll be able to track
and monitor the progress

509
00:23:25.693 --> 00:23:27.110
of the virus and our success

510
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.235
in getting it down, but also
if there are hotspots that flare up

511
00:23:30.235 --> 00:23:32.401
and action is needed
we will have that knowledge.

512
00:23:32.401 --> 00:23:35.026
The crucial thing, though,
is it’s not going to be storing

513
00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:36.943
and recording people’s locations
that can be identified

514
00:23:36.943 --> 00:23:37.985
to an individual.

515
00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:40.651
This is a system that keeps
all of that data anonymous.

516
00:23:40.651 --> 00:23:43.026
It operates, you know,
as a system that keeps people

517
00:23:43.026 --> 00:23:45.193
plus my identity in the clear
of any involvement.

518
00:23:45.193 --> 00:23:47.110
And I know it only
launched this morning.

519
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.235
Do you know what the take—up has
been on the Isle of Wight?

520
00:23:50.235 --> 00:23:52.151
Ah, no, I don’t have that data yet.

521
00:23:52.151 --> 00:23:53.193
It’s onlyjust been...

522
00:23:53.193 --> 00:23:54.235
It’s 20% so far.

523
00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:55.276
0h, right.

524
00:23:55.276 --> 00:23:56.485
Chris knows.
Well, that’s something.

525
00:23:56.485 --> 00:23:57.526
It’s 20% so far.

526
00:23:57.526 --> 00:23:58.735
Yes, it’s 20% so far.

527
00:23:58.735 --> 00:24:02.360
If the app is going to work then
I think there are two or three

528
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.526
things that need to happen.

529
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:06.401
First, it clearly does need to work
in terms of, for example,

530
00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:08.818
there are some questions about how
much battery power it

531
00:24:08.818 --> 00:24:09.860
pulls off an iPhone.

532
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.193
The second issue is it clearly needs
to be linked to the right track

533
00:24:13.193 --> 00:24:14.235
and tracing resource.

534
00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:16.860
In other words, if, for example,
you have been in close

535
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.568
contact with somebody,
you will want to get a test very,

536
00:24:19.568 --> 00:24:22.110
very quickly, and one of the issues
is that by focusing,

537
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.276
as we have done, on purely
hitting that 100,000,

538
00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:26.443
as the Government has done —
hitting that 100,000

539
00:24:26.443 --> 00:24:28.610
target by April 30th,
we haven’t really quite got

540
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.526
the geographic spread
that we need of testing.

541
00:24:30.526 --> 00:24:32.443
So that will need to be ramped up.

542
00:24:32.443 --> 00:24:34.110
Because you’ve talked
about staff members having

543
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.360
to wait, what, five days?

544
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.401
Ithink, you know...

545
00:24:38.401 --> 00:24:39.443
To get a test.

546
00:24:39.443 --> 00:24:41.860
We should recognise the fact that
testing capacity has grown

547
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.526
really quite quickly,
but the problem is if you just focus

548
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:47.360
on the number of tests on April 30,
you’re missing a whole

549
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.443
bunch of things.

550
00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:50.860
Well, it is the only day
we’ve had that number.

551
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.026
The testing hotline is warning that
test results could take 7—10 days.

552
00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:56.193
So if you have to go
into self isolation...

553
00:24:56.193 --> 00:24:58.110
Well, that’s a real
concern for some other...

554
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.985
..for two weeks, then you can’t
get your results for 7—10 days...

555
00:25:00.985 --> 00:25:03.443
It’s a real concern for some
of our trust leaders.

556
00:25:03.443 --> 00:25:06.026
So I was talking to a trust
yesterday, I trust chief

557
00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:08.693
yesterday, a trust chief

558
00:25:08.693 --> 00:25:11.068
executive yesterday,
the two weeks ago was able to get

559
00:25:11.068 --> 00:25:13.943
tests turned round within a day,
but they’re now taking five days.

560
00:25:13.943 --> 00:25:16.860
What we are basically saying is,
"Yes, OK, the capacity as part

561
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.985
of the story in terms of growing
the capacity," but what we’ve got

562
00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:23.360
to ensure is everybody who needs
access to a test can get it quickly,

563
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.235
and then the other
thing we need to...

564
00:25:25.235 --> 00:25:26.901
And are you confident
that will happen?

565
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:29.068
Well, that’s the bit that’s
still kind of needs...

566
00:25:29.068 --> 00:25:32.193
I mean, the NHS needs
to play its part, but we also need

567
00:25:32.193 --> 00:25:33.235
support from the Government.

568
00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:36.151
The other bit, which is the bit
we are specifically talking about,

569
00:25:36.151 --> 00:25:39.235
is as we exit and begin to ease
lockdown, it will be really

570
00:25:39.235 --> 00:25:42.401
important for everybody in the NHS
to know the role they are meant

571
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:45.735
to be playing in terms of the use
of this app and supporting it,

572
00:25:45.735 --> 00:25:48.651
and this is coming really quite
quickly, but at the moment nobody

573
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:51.485
in the NHS quite knows what role
they’re meant to be playing

574
00:25:51.485 --> 00:25:52.526
to support the app.

575
00:25:52.526 --> 00:25:55.651
So what we will need is the results
of that pilot, that trial,

576
00:25:55.651 --> 00:25:57.985
on the Isle of Wight,
circulated very quickly.

577
00:25:57.985 --> 00:26:00.151
And all the trusts, GPs,
111 service, pharmacies that

578
00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:02.610
are absolutely at the front line
and talking to patients,

579
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.693
they’ll need to know very quickly
what they are meant to be doing

580
00:26:05.693 --> 00:26:07.860
in a way that they
don’t at the moment.

581
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.985
Well, also people need
to know how it works,

582
00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:12.901
and as George doesn’t seem to be
completely clear about how it’s

583
00:26:12.901 --> 00:26:13.901
going to work but...

584
00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:16.318
I can’t help but feel
that the Government keeps getting

585
00:26:16.318 --> 00:26:17.568
distracted by the wrong things.

586
00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:20.151
I mean, we were talking about why
the Government didn’t have

587
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:21.193
testing in place earlier.

588
00:26:21.193 --> 00:26:23.860
I think one of the reasons
as they were too consumed

589
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.026
with all these models and ideas
about herd immunity

590
00:26:26.026 --> 00:26:27.068
instead of actually...

591
00:26:27.068 --> 00:26:28.776
Which now seems like
a devastating idea.

592
00:26:28.776 --> 00:26:31.151
Instead of doing the work of getting
testing, protective equipment,

593
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:32.860
contact tracing in place.

594
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.568
Now here’s this app,
which forgive me if I don’t feel

595
00:26:35.568 --> 00:26:37.485
like the Government actually fully
understand how it’s

596
00:26:37.485 --> 00:26:42.443
going to work, and...

597
00:26:46.818 --> 00:26:49.443
And we’re still not totally clear
from what George was saying.

598
00:26:49.443 --> 00:26:50.651
Well, look, it’s being piloted.

599
00:26:50.651 --> 00:26:52.818
We don’t know how it’s
going to work, and...

600
00:26:52.818 --> 00:26:53.860
But without testing...

601
00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.151
We’ve heard about the NHS care home
staff who are on the front line,

602
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:59.610
who are experiencing a catastrophic
situation, still can’t get tests,

603
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.235
then having to apply for them
online, they are not getting

604
00:27:02.235 --> 00:27:03.235
them on time.

605
00:27:03.235 --> 00:27:06.651
Many care staff are saying every day
they can’t get their hands on tests.

606
00:27:06.651 --> 00:27:09.235
How can whole sections
of the population who are using this

607
00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:14.276
app, which the Government
is encouraging people on the Isle

608
00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:16.568
of Wight to use,
without any clear idea

609
00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:17.818
of whether they’ll be able

610
00:27:17.818 --> 00:27:18.985
to follow up with testing...

611
00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:21.651
And even though you said, George,
that there won’t be masses

612
00:27:21.651 --> 00:27:24.026
of data on the database,
my understanding is that once

613
00:27:24.026 --> 00:27:27.151
you sign up to the app, no,
there isn’t a lot of data,

614
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:30.485
but as soon as you develop symptoms
of coronavirus you have to have that

615
00:27:30.485 --> 00:27:32.651
information stored on a database,
otherwise it can’t work.

616
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:35.068
Well, James is asking,
is that a price worth paying?

617
00:27:35.068 --> 00:27:37.943
Well, I don’t know because I don’t
have confidence that the information

618
00:27:37.943 --> 00:27:40.318
and data protection professionals
have been consulted in this process.

619
00:27:40.318 --> 00:27:42.485
I mean, certainly I’ve seen data
protection lawyers saying

620
00:27:42.485 --> 00:27:45.151
the Information Commissioner was not
consulted on the development of this

621
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:47.318
app, that it potentially fails
the NHS app standards

622
00:27:47.318 --> 00:27:48.360
for data protection.

623
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.943
There are so many questions
about who was involved in this

624
00:27:50.943 --> 00:27:52.193
process, who was consulted, what.

625
00:27:52.193 --> 00:27:53.235
process, who was consulted.

626
00:27:53.235 --> 00:27:55.860
What assurances can the Government
give a us in the data

627
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.860
protection standards?

628
00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.318
And the NHS itself doesn’t
have a perfect track record

629
00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:01.735
of storing patient data,
so I think we have every

630
00:28:01.735 --> 00:28:02.776
right to be concerned.

631
00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:06.610
It may be that it is a price worth
paying, but we need to be assured

632
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.276
that a very rigorous process has
been

633
00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:10.693
undergoing before we get
to the stage of being able

634
00:28:10.693 --> 00:28:12.360
to have an informed
conversation about that.

635
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.443
And I think we have to,
when we are giving away our civil

636
00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.110
liberties, all of our liberties,
including privacy,

637
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.818
we have to be informed
about what we are giving away

638
00:28:19.818 --> 00:28:21.443
and what we are getting in return.

639
00:28:21.443 --> 00:28:23.651
And I haven’t seen anything
like that quality of

640
00:28:23.651 --> 00:28:24.693
conversation happen yet.

641
00:28:24.693 --> 00:28:26.860
Juergen, I can see
you want to come in.

642
00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.860
Yeah.

643
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.901
Imean...

644
00:28:28.901 --> 00:28:30.860
First of all, we absolutely
need this technology.

645
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.193
We need this app and we need to be
able to track and trace.

646
00:28:34.193 --> 00:28:36.610
This has been the strategy
in countries that have managed

647
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.526
this very successfully,
in South Korea, for example.

648
00:28:38.526 --> 00:28:38.735
and

649
00:28:38.735 --> 00:28:38.860
andl

650
00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.610
and I think specifically to the
point of data, you know, this needs

651
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.151
point of data, you know, this needs
absolute trust and transparency. I

652
00:28:44.151 --> 00:28:45.651
absolute trust and transparency. I
think everybody needs to understand

653
00:28:45.651 --> 00:28:47.818
think everybody needs to understand
exactly what the data is going to be

654
00:28:47.818 --> 00:28:50.485
exactly what the data is going to be
used for, which is only for this

655
00:28:50.485 --> 00:28:54.860
used for, which is only for this
purpose of tracking and tracing, and

656
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.068
purpose of tracking and tracing, and
with that making sure we can save

657
00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:57.276
with that making sure we ran save
lives.

658
00:28:57.276 --> 00:28:59.818
with that making sure we can save
lives. That’s what it’s about. And

659
00:28:59.818 --> 00:29:01.485
lives. That’s what it’s about. And
absolute trust the data will not be

660
00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:02.860
absolute trust the data will not be
used for any other commercial

661
00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.693
used for any other commercial
purpose. One final point I would

662
00:29:04.693 --> 00:29:06.651
purpose. One final point I would
like to make, what I am a bit

663
00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:08.818
like to make, what I am a bit
surprised about is that we are not

664
00:29:08.818 --> 00:29:11.276
surprised about is that we are not
learning from countries that are

665
00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:12.610
learning from countries that are
further ahead of this, they’ve

666
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.068
further ahead of this, therve
already

667
00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:14.735
further ahead of this, they’ve
already resolved some of these

668
00:29:14.735 --> 00:29:16.693
already resolved some of these
problems, they’ve resolved some of

669
00:29:16.693 --> 00:29:17.026
problems, therve resolved some of
the privacy

670
00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:18.068
problems, they’ve resolved some of
the privacy issues. And we do seem

671
00:29:18.068 --> 00:29:20.776
the privacy issues. And we do seem
to be going down a the tother go it

672
00:29:20.776 --> 00:29:22.443
to be going down a the tother go it
alone strategy here, and I would

673
00:29:22.443 --> 00:29:24.735
alone strategy here, and I would
suggest, let’s do our trials on the

674
00:29:24.735 --> 00:29:25.401
suggest, let’s do our trials on the
Isla of Wight,

675
00:29:25.401 --> 00:29:26.818
suggest, let’s do our trials on the
Isle of Wight, but it might be a

676
00:29:26.818 --> 00:29:27.985
Isla of Wight, but it might be a
good idea to

677
00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:28.693
Isle of Wight, but it might be a
good idea to back another horse

678
00:29:28.693 --> 00:29:31.151
good idea to back another horse
which is the app that has been

679
00:29:31.151 --> 00:29:32.693
which is the app that has been
developed in Korea, the one

680
00:29:32.693 --> 00:29:34.651
developed in Korea, the one
developed in Europe by Google and

681
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:36.235
developed in Europe by Google and
Apple so we have two horses so we

682
00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:37.526
Apple so we have two horses so we
ran get one of

683
00:29:37.526 --> 00:29:38.360
Apple so we have two horses so we
can get one of them to work very

684
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:38.943
ran get one of them to work very
quickly,

685
00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:41.068
can get one of them to work very
quickly, because we need to. Do you

686
00:29:41.068 --> 00:29:44.651
quickly, because we need to. Do you
think we should be doing that, Nick?

687
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:47.860
think we should be doing that, Nick?
The owner, we are in favour of using

688
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.985
The owner, we are in favour of using
test, track and trace, and we have

689
00:29:49.985 --> 00:29:52.193
test, track and trace, and we have
been arguing for a strategy on this

690
00:29:52.193 --> 00:29:53.735
been arguing for a strategy on this
for some considerable time now ——

691
00:29:53.735 --> 00:29:54.068
for some considerabla time now --
the

692
00:29:54.068 --> 00:29:55.068
for some considerable time now --
the owner, we

693
00:29:55.068 --> 00:29:56.318
for some considerable time now ——
the owner, we are in favour. I think

694
00:29:56.318 --> 00:29:58.693
the owner, we are in favour. I think
the app is very much part of that,

695
00:29:58.693 --> 00:30:00.860
the app is very much part of that,
an essential tool as we look at that

696
00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.068
an essential tool as we look at that
tracing strategy now going forward.

697
00:30:05.068 --> 00:30:06.818
tracing strategy now going forward.
It is also true to say, though, that

698
00:30:06.818 --> 00:30:07.151
It is also tme to say, though, that
it is

699
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:07.651
It is also two to say, though, that
it is going to

700
00:30:07.651 --> 00:30:09.026
It is also true to say, though, that
it is going to require oversight.

701
00:30:09.026 --> 00:30:09.235
it is going to require oversight.
Cleariy

702
00:30:09.235 --> 00:30:10.818
it is going to require oversight.
Clearly there is going to be a set

703
00:30:10.818 --> 00:30:11.610
Cleariy there is going to be a set
of data, it is

704
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.485
Clearly there is going to be a set
of data, it is going to have to be

705
00:30:13.485 --> 00:30:15.068
of data, it is going to have to be
held centrally. If you are going to

706
00:30:15.068 --> 00:30:16.526
held centrally. If you are going to
pick up those different parts of the

707
00:30:16.526 --> 00:30:18.110
pick up those different parts of the
country where there are outbreaks. I

708
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.568
country where there are outbreaks. I
think we need to be clear that is

709
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:23.151
think we need to be clear that is
being protected, and as has been

710
00:30:23.151 --> 00:30:25.693
being protected, and as has been
already said, that the data is used

711
00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:27.235
already said, that the data is used
exclusively for the purpose it is

712
00:30:27.235 --> 00:30:30.776
exclusively for the purpose it is
meant for which is public health

713
00:30:30.776 --> 00:30:32.943
meant for which is public health
emergency and not for enforcement or

714
00:30:32.943 --> 00:30:33.860
emergency and not for enforcement or
surveillance or commercial purposes.

715
00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.693
surveillance or commercial purposes.
I do think there needs to be a

716
00:30:36.693 --> 00:30:38.151
I do think there needs to be a
Parliamentary oversight, but I think

717
00:30:38.151 --> 00:30:38.818
Partiamentary oversight, but I think
the app itself

718
00:30:38.818 --> 00:30:41.610
Parliamentary oversight, but I think
the app itself is going to be in a

719
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.651
the app itself is going to be in a
necessity going forward in order to

720
00:30:43.651 --> 00:30:45.651
necessity going forward in order to
move out of the lockdown. Fiona, I

721
00:30:45.651 --> 00:30:47.443
move out of the lockdown. Fiona, I
think we’re missing something quite

722
00:30:47.443 --> 00:30:49.985
think we’re missing something quite
important. Juergen spoke about the

723
00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:50.235
important. juergen spoke about the
two

724
00:30:50.235 --> 00:30:51.651
important. Juergen spoke about the
two different apps and we need to

725
00:30:51.651 --> 00:30:53.026
two different apps and we need to
understand they have different ways

726
00:30:53.026 --> 00:30:56.276
understand they have different ways
in which the data is held. The

727
00:30:56.276 --> 00:30:56.818
in which the data is held. The
Googla

728
00:30:56.818 --> 00:30:58.568
in which the data is held. The
Google Apple app deliberately has a

729
00:30:58.568 --> 00:31:00.110
Google Apple app deliberately has a
decentralised approach and doesn’t

730
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.151
decentralised approach and doesn’t
hold all of the data in a single

731
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:02.735
hold all of the data in a singla
database,

732
00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:03.651
hold all of the data in a single
database, where is the one the

733
00:31:03.651 --> 00:31:05.318
database, where is the one the
Government is developing at the

734
00:31:05.318 --> 00:31:08.610
Government is developing at the
moment does, and I do think I really

735
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.860
moment does, and I do think I really
intervention came about three or

736
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.693
intervention came about three or
four weeks ago from the former

737
00:31:12.693 --> 00:31:13.776
four weeks ago from the former
director—general of MI5, Jonathan

738
00:31:13.776 --> 00:31:14.693
director-general of MIS, jonathan
Evans, who

739
00:31:14.693 --> 00:31:16.193
director—general of MI5, Jonathan
Evans, who said he thought it was

740
00:31:16.193 --> 00:31:18.401
Evans, who said he thought it was
incredibly important that we had the

741
00:31:18.401 --> 00:31:20.026
incredibly important that we had the
quality of national debate that Afua

742
00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:22.485
quality of national debate that Afua
was talking about in terms of around

743
00:31:22.485 --> 00:31:23.943
was talking about in terms of around
these issues, and interestingly he

744
00:31:23.943 --> 00:31:25.735
these issues, and interestingly he
pointed to exactly the same thing

745
00:31:25.735 --> 00:31:27.485
pointed to exactly the same thing
Nick was talking about, which is

746
00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:29.901
Nick was talking about, which is
there are circumstances where you do

747
00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:31.943
there are circumstances where you do
use personal data, for example

748
00:31:31.943 --> 00:31:32.860
use personal data, for example
fighting crime and preventing

749
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.026
fighting crime and preventing
terrorism, but there are some really

750
00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:36.651
terrorism, but there are some really
strict parliamentary oversight

751
00:31:36.651 --> 00:31:39.401
strict parliamentary oversight
procedures to ensure that that data

752
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:41.068
procedures to ensure that that data
is being held properly. The app will

753
00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:41.776
is being held property. The app will
only work if

754
00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:44.360
is being held properly. The app will
only work if we can get 50—60%, 70%

755
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.485
only work if we ran get 50-6096, 7096
of the people

756
00:31:45.485 --> 00:31:46.485
only work if we can get 50—60%, 70%
of the people to use it. I think

757
00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:47.110
of the peopla to use it. I think
peopla

758
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.068
of the people to use it. I think
people need to be confident they can

759
00:31:49.068 --> 00:31:49.651
people need to be confident they ran
tmst it, and

760
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:50.443
people need to be confident they can
trust it, and therefore what is

761
00:31:50.443 --> 00:31:51.735
trust it, and therefore what is
really important is that that

762
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.443
really important is that that
oversight should be put in place and

763
00:31:53.443 --> 00:31:53.776
oversight should be put in place and
peopla will

764
00:31:53.776 --> 00:31:54.985
oversight should be put in place and
people will know that the data they

765
00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:55.693
peopla will know that the data they
are going to

766
00:31:55.693 --> 00:31:56.735
people will know that the data they
are going to provide is not going to

767
00:31:56.735 --> 00:32:01.860
are going to provide is not going to
be misused.

768
00:32:02.818 --> 00:32:07.360
One advantage with the NHS app is
that people can trust it, it’s part

769
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:07.901
that peopla ran trust it, it’s part
of the NHS,

770
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:08.776
that people can trust it, it’s part
of the NHS, but gives better

771
00:32:08.776 --> 00:32:10.818
of the NHS, but gives better
information about where you might

772
00:32:10.818 --> 00:32:11.193
information about where you might
get [oral

773
00:32:11.193 --> 00:32:11.985
information about where you might
get local flare—ups so we can

774
00:32:11.985 --> 00:32:12.485
get [oral ﬂare-ups so we ran
respond to

775
00:32:12.485 --> 00:32:14.193
get local flare—ups so we can
respond to that and monitor local or

776
00:32:14.193 --> 00:32:14.360
respond to that and monitor [oral or
regional

777
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.693
respond to that and monitor local or
regional pick—ups in the virus. We

778
00:32:17.693 --> 00:32:18.735
regional pick-ups in the vims. We
have had a

779
00:32:18.735 --> 00:32:20.276
regional pick—ups in the virus. We
have had a number of comments, and

780
00:32:20.276 --> 00:32:21.735
have had a number of comments, and
this one says, is it really safe

781
00:32:21.735 --> 00:32:24.526
this one says, is it really safe
using Bluetooth? Can criminals take

782
00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:24.901
using Bluetooth? (“an criminals take
personal info

783
00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:26.776
using Bluetooth? Can criminals take
personal info from your phone? Will

784
00:32:26.776 --> 00:32:27.443
personal info from your phone? will
it only work

785
00:32:27.443 --> 00:32:28.276
personal info from your phone? Will
it only work with honesty from the

786
00:32:28.276 --> 00:32:31.610
it only work with honesty from the
user? You have to report you have

787
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.985
user? You have to report you have
symptoms. will

788
00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:34.276
user? You have to report you have
symptoms. Will it be any use? You

789
00:32:34.276 --> 00:32:34.818
symptoms. will it be any use? You
need a

790
00:32:34.818 --> 00:32:35.901
symptoms. Will it be any use? You
need a significant take up to get

791
00:32:35.901 --> 00:32:37.901
need a significant take up to get
the information you want from it.

792
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:38.360
the information you want from it.
james, what

793
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.610
the information you want from it.
James, what do you think of what you

794
00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:39.860
james, what do you think of what you
have

795
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.860
James, what do you think of what you
have heard? Yeah can mention South

796
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.901
have heard? Yeah ran mention South
Korea, and

797
00:32:46.901 --> 00:32:47.651
have heard? Yeah can mention South
Korea, and the reading I’ve been

798
00:32:47.651 --> 00:32:49.318
Korea, and the reading I’ve been
doing about South Korea as they not

799
00:32:49.318 --> 00:32:50.735
doing about South Korea as they not
only use track and trace but also

800
00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:53.526
only use track and trace but also
some of the data that is freely

801
00:32:53.526 --> 00:32:56.151
some of the data that is freely
available, information from the GPS

802
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:57.943
availabla, information from the GPS
system, CCTV

803
00:32:57.943 --> 00:33:00.026
available, information from the GPS
system, CCTV system and also as well

804
00:33:00.026 --> 00:33:02.526
system, CCTV system and also as well
from credit card spending and things

805
00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:06.068
from credit card spending and things
like that, as I said during the we

806
00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:08.860
like that, as I said during the we
need to give the tracers as much

807
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.276
need to give the tracers as much
information as possible and just

808
00:33:12.276 --> 00:33:12.776
information as possibla and just
look at

809
00:33:12.776 --> 00:33:15.735
information as possible and just
look at the sacrifice we have all

810
00:33:15.735 --> 00:33:19.276
look at the sacrifice we have all
made that we need really to trust

811
00:33:19.276 --> 00:33:25.818
made that we need really to trust
the tracers to be able to meet that

812
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.901
the tracers to be able to meet that
target, to get this virus. 70 to 90%

813
00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:31.110
target, to get this vims. 70 to 9096
of the peopla

814
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.110
target, to get this virus. 70 to 90%
of the people have been in contact

815
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.776
of the people have been in contact
within the last two weeks. If we

816
00:33:33.776 --> 00:33:35.860
within the last two weeks. If we
don’t do that, we could have another

817
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.568
don’t do that, we could have another
ﬂare-up. So

818
00:33:36.568 --> 00:33:36.818
don’t do that, we could have another
ﬂare-up. Sol

819
00:33:36.818 --> 00:33:37.360
don’t do that, we could have another
flare—up. So I think the privacy

820
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:37.776
ﬂare-up. So I think the privacy
issue has

821
00:33:37.776 --> 00:33:37.943
flare—up. So I think the privacy
issue has to

822
00:33:37.943 --> 00:33:38.110
ﬂare-up. So I think the privacy
issue has to go

823
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.193
flare—up. So I think the privacy
issue has to go out of the window,

824
00:33:39.193 --> 00:33:41.651
issue has to go out of the window,
and we have to say this is what it

825
00:33:41.651 --> 00:33:43.651
and we have to say this is what it
is, and we’ve got to use all the

826
00:33:43.651 --> 00:33:45.776
is, and we’ve got to use all the
available technology and data to

827
00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:48.568
available technology and data to
make sure that we can crack this

828
00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.360
make sure that we ran crack this
virus, and

829
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.818
make sure that we can crack this
virus, and let’s start living again,

830
00:33:51.818 --> 00:33:53.485
virus, and let’s start living again,
because we’ve all made too many

831
00:33:53.485 --> 00:33:54.985
because we’ve all made too many
sacrifices, and we are trying to get

832
00:33:54.985 --> 00:33:56.610
sacrifices, and we are trying to get
out of lockdown to save the economy

833
00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.485
out of lockdown to save the economy
and jobs. It sounds like you’re

834
00:34:00.485 --> 00:34:01.860
and jobs. It sounds like you’re
desperate to get out of the house,

835
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.485
desperate to get out of the house,
and you will not be alone in that!

836
00:34:03.485 --> 00:34:05.860
and you will not be alone in that!
George, the governor has said it

837
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.276
George, the governor has said it
wants to recruit 18,000 four contact

838
00:34:09.276 --> 00:34:09.693
wants to recmit18,000 four contact
tracing. How

839
00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:10.235
wants to recruit 18,000 four contact
tracing. How many have been

840
00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:14.901
tracing. How many have been
recruited so far? At 5000 so far, so

841
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:18.568
recruited so far? At 5000 so far, so
that’s being built. As we try and

842
00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:20.110
that’s being built. As we try and
evolve the policy and move out of

843
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.068
evolve the policy and move out of
lockdown and trying to get back to

844
00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:23.776
lockdown and trying to get back to
life as normal, 3 track and trace

845
00:34:23.776 --> 00:34:24.193
life as normal, a track and trace
system along

846
00:34:24.193 --> 00:34:25.276
life as normal, 3 track and trace
system along these lines will be a

847
00:34:25.276 --> 00:34:27.943
system along these lines will be a
critical tool.

848
00:34:27.943 --> 00:34:28.110
system along these lines will be a
criticaltool. Lets

849
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:28.818
system along these lines will be a
critical tool. Lets take a question

850
00:34:28.818 --> 00:34:31.651
critical tool. Lets take a question
from Saskia Jennings. Do you think

851
00:34:31.651 --> 00:34:31.818
from Saskia jennings. Do you think
it’s

852
00:34:31.818 --> 00:34:33.818
from Saskia Jennings. Do you think
it’s appropriate to ease a lockdown

853
00:34:33.818 --> 00:34:37.110
it’s appropriate to ease a lockdown
in all areas of the country at the

854
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.485
in all areas of the country at the
same time even though the effects of

855
00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:39.735
same time even though the effects of
the virus have not been evenly

856
00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:42.776
the virus have not been evenly
distributed? The north—east, we have

857
00:34:42.776 --> 00:34:43.860
distributed? The north-east, we have
seen high death

858
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.693
distributed? The north—east, we have
seen high death rates in towns like

859
00:34:44.693 --> 00:34:45.776
seen high death rates in towns like
Middlesbrough and Sunderland and I

860
00:34:45.776 --> 00:34:45.901
Middlesbrough and Sundertand and I
don’t

861
00:34:45.901 --> 00:34:47.068
Middlesbrough and Sunderland and I
don’t know if they should be managed

862
00:34:47.068 --> 00:34:48.943
don’t know if they should be managed
like other areas of the country like

863
00:34:48.943 --> 00:34:52.276
like other areas of the country like
the south—west. At Nicola Sturgeon

864
00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:52.651
the south-west. At Nicola Sturgeon
today was

865
00:34:52.651 --> 00:34:53.901
the south—west. At Nicola Sturgeon
today was talking about is Scotland

866
00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:54.985
today was talking about is Scotland
and saying she doesn’t see any

867
00:34:54.985 --> 00:34:58.651
and saying she doesn’t see any
easing of lockdown anytime soon.

868
00:34:58.651 --> 00:35:00.443
easing of lockdown anytime soon.
Nick, what do you think? What is the

869
00:35:00.443 --> 00:35:00.693
Nick, what do you think? what is the
labour

870
00:35:00.693 --> 00:35:02.693
Nick, what do you think? What is the
Labour view about is in the lockdown

871
00:35:02.693 --> 00:35:03.068
labour view about is in the lockdown
differently in

872
00:35:03.068 --> 00:35:04.026
Labour view about is in the lockdown
differently in different areas

873
00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:05.360
differently in different areas
depending on the infection rate, the

874
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.443
depending on the infection rate, the
number of cases and so on? Well, I

875
00:35:10.443 --> 00:35:10.651
number of cases and so on? Well, I
sit

876
00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:11.110
number of rases and so on? Well, I
sit here in

877
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:11.985
number of cases and so on? Well, I
sit here in Wales, Fiona, and there

878
00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:13.485
sit here in Wales, Fiona, and there
have been moments in the crisis

879
00:35:13.485 --> 00:35:16.985
have been moments in the crisis
where Wales has taken a slightly

880
00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:18.693
where Wales has taken a slightly
different decisions. For example,

881
00:35:18.693 --> 00:35:19.735
different decisions. For example,
the guidelines are slightly

882
00:35:19.735 --> 00:35:22.568
the guidelines are slightly
different but, on the whole, the

883
00:35:22.568 --> 00:35:23.901
different but, on the whole, the
Welsh government, has tried to take

884
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:25.443
Welsh government, has tried to take
a four nations approach, and I think

885
00:35:25.443 --> 00:35:29.443
a four nations approach, and I think
that has been a sensible way to

886
00:35:29.443 --> 00:35:32.651
that has been a sensible way to
proceed because we do all shared

887
00:35:32.651 --> 00:35:34.151
proceed because we do all shared
these islands and, for example, my

888
00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:39.151
these islands and, for example, my
own constituency, I would in

889
00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:39.943
own constituency, I would in
ordinary circumstances have people

890
00:35:39.943 --> 00:35:40.151
ordinary circumstances have peopla
who

891
00:35:40.151 --> 00:35:42.985
ordinary circumstances have people
who commuted to work, but a

892
00:35:42.985 --> 00:35:44.526
who commuted to work, but a
different situation at the moment,

893
00:35:44.526 --> 00:35:45.485
different situation at the moment,
but ordinarily they would commute

894
00:35:45.485 --> 00:35:48.235
but ordinarily they would commute
over the border into Bristol, so it

895
00:35:48.235 --> 00:35:49.860
over the border into Bristol, so it
gets very difficult if you have

896
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.651
gets very difficult if you have
things which are very different in

897
00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:53.360
things which are very different in
different parts of the country. The

898
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.276
different parts of the country. The
only point I would make in relation

899
00:35:55.276 --> 00:36:01.151
only point I would make in relation
to that is that we just talked about

900
00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:02.360
to that is that we just talked about
the contact tracing app. Clearly, if

901
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:02.568
the contact tracing app. Clearty, if
there

902
00:36:02.568 --> 00:36:06.193
the contact tracing app. Clearly, if
there were to be after these

903
00:36:06.193 --> 00:36:07.235
there were to be after these
lockdown restrictions start to ease

904
00:36:07.235 --> 00:36:10.443
lockdown restrictions start to ease
a particular area where the tracing

905
00:36:10.443 --> 00:36:10.693
a particular area where the tracing
aPP

906
00:36:10.693 --> 00:36:13.485
a particular area where the tracing
app showed that there was a specific

907
00:36:13.485 --> 00:36:14.651
app showed that there was a specific
problem, then clearly you might have

908
00:36:14.651 --> 00:36:15.235
problam, then dearty you might have
to look at

909
00:36:15.235 --> 00:36:18.318
problem, then clearly you might have
to look at that specific area so,

910
00:36:18.318 --> 00:36:20.360
to look at that specific area so,
whilst I accept there will be

911
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.860
whilst I accept there will be
variations, and they have already

912
00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.068
variations, and they have already
been variations, I think we should

913
00:36:23.068 --> 00:36:25.860
been variations, I think we should
try and go for the four visions

914
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.318
try and go for the four visions
approach that the Welsh government

915
00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:30.151
approach that the Welsh government
has been doing as much as possible.

916
00:36:30.151 --> 00:36:33.443
has been doing as much as possible.
But also ensure that, as the Prime

917
00:36:33.443 --> 00:36:34.693
But also ensure that, as the Prime
Minister moves forward, he to be

918
00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:38.693
Minister moves forward, he to be
setting out a road map on Sunday,

919
00:36:38.693 --> 00:36:40.485
setting out a road map on Sunday,
that he works with the devolved

920
00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:41.651
that he works with the devolved
institutions in order to get that

921
00:36:41.651 --> 00:36:42.901
institutions in order to get that
consensus across the country,

922
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:44.068
consensus across the country,
because I think that is so

923
00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:48.735
because I think that is so
important. Chris, can you see from

924
00:36:48.735 --> 00:36:48.985
important. Chris, ran you see from
the perspective

925
00:36:48.985 --> 00:36:50.235
important. Chris, can you see from
the perspective of NHS workers that

926
00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:51.735
the perspective of NHS workers that
you represent, is there an ottoman,

927
00:36:51.735 --> 00:36:55.443
you represent, is there an ottoman,
do you think? The government has

928
00:36:55.443 --> 00:36:57.485
do you think? The government has
said it is too soon at the moment,

929
00:36:57.485 --> 00:37:00.068
said it is too soon at the moment,
and the Prime Minister has made that

930
00:37:00.068 --> 00:37:00.860
and the Prime Minister has made that
clear, but reintroducing the

931
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.901
clear, but reintroducing the
lockdown in certain areas depending

932
00:37:01.901 --> 00:37:03.860
lockdown in certain areas depending
on what is happening, but can you

933
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.860
on what is happening, but ran you
see an

934
00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.860
on what is happening, but can you
see an argument, as Saskia says, for

935
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.860
see an argument, as Saskia says, for
easing the lockdown differently as

936
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.026
easing the lockdown differently as
we go along? There is a real dilemma

937
00:37:14.026 --> 00:37:15.693
we go along? There is a real dilemma
here because one striking thing,

938
00:37:15.693 --> 00:37:17.276
here because one striking thing,
talking to trust chief executives,

939
00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.693
talking to trust chief executives,
is the degree to which this has

940
00:37:18.693 --> 00:37:21.860
is the degree to which this has
varied very much. We talk to trust

941
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.276
varied very much. We talk to trust
executives in London, it’s been

942
00:37:23.276 --> 00:37:26.026
executives in London, it’s been
really difficult. In the south—west,

943
00:37:26.026 --> 00:37:26.776
really difficult. In the south-west,
actually, they

944
00:37:26.776 --> 00:37:27.610
really difficult. In the south—west,
actually, they have been saying that

945
00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.235
actually, they have been saying that
relatively speaking it’s been...

946
00:37:30.235 --> 00:37:31.068
relatively speaking it’s been. . .
They haven’t

947
00:37:31.068 --> 00:37:31.693
relatively speaking it’s been...
They haven’t experienced the level

948
00:37:31.693 --> 00:37:32.985
They haven’t experienced the level
of demand they were expecting the

949
00:37:32.985 --> 00:37:34.985
of demand they were expecting the
step but the bit we are missing,

950
00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:37.026
step but the bit we are missing,
which feels really important to me,

951
00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:39.110
which feels really important to me,
is one of the things about lockdown

952
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.485
is one of the things about lockdown
has been the consistency of the

953
00:37:40.485 --> 00:37:43.235
has been the consistency of the
national communications. We need to

954
00:37:43.235 --> 00:37:45.693
national communications. We need to
be clear about what it is that we

955
00:37:45.693 --> 00:37:48.610
be clear about what it is that we
are meant to be doing and not. Do

956
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.776
are meant to be doing and not. Do
you think it’s been inconsistent? My

957
00:37:52.776 --> 00:37:54.568
you think it’s been inconsistent? My
argument would be, if we try and

958
00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:56.776
argument would be, if we try and
have different areas doing different

959
00:37:56.776 --> 00:37:57.651
have different areas doing different
things, it’s already complicated

960
00:37:57.651 --> 00:37:59.026
things, it’s already complicated
enough as far as I’m concerned in

961
00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.693
enough as far as I’m concerned in
terms of what you are meant to be

962
00:38:00.693 --> 00:38:03.943
terms of what you are meant to be
doing and not doing, that that it

963
00:38:03.943 --> 00:38:06.068
doing and not doing, that that it
seems to me is a very strong

964
00:38:06.068 --> 00:38:06.485
seems to me is a very strong
argument to

965
00:38:06.485 --> 00:38:06.818
seems to me is a very strong
argument tojust be

966
00:38:06.818 --> 00:38:07.193
seems to me is a very strong
argument to just be careful about

967
00:38:07.193 --> 00:38:07.735
argument tojust be careful about
splitting the

968
00:38:07.735 --> 00:38:09.235
argument to just be careful about
splitting the country into different

969
00:38:09.235 --> 00:38:10.276
splitting the country into different
places trying to do different

970
00:38:10.276 --> 00:38:14.526
places trying to do different
things. Thank Scotland, Wales and

971
00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:15.610
things. Thank Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland can do it

972
00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:19.568
Northern Ireland can do it
differently. Clearly, the default

973
00:38:19.568 --> 00:38:22.860
differently. Clearly, the default
nations is issues, but all I say is

974
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.110
nations is issues, but all I say is
that you have this tension because

975
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.735
that you have this tension because
if you were just doing it on the

976
00:38:25.735 --> 00:38:28.443
if you were just doing it on the
basis of where you had prevalence,

977
00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:29.985
basis of where you had prevalence,
the first peak torque is clearly

978
00:38:29.985 --> 00:38:30.110
the first peak torque is dearty
that

979
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.776
the first peak torque is clearly
that actually you are getting very

980
00:38:32.776 --> 00:38:35.985
that actually you are getting very
different spread in different areas.

981
00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:39.401
different spread in different areas.
What strikes me about the question,

982
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:40.068
what strikes me about the question,
not the

983
00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:41.026
What strikes me about the question,
not the direct question, but Saskia

984
00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:43.068
not the direct question, but Saskia
talks about easing the restrictions

985
00:38:43.068 --> 00:38:44.193
talks about easing the restrictions
and, given the figures today about

986
00:38:44.193 --> 00:38:46.276
and, given the figures today about
the death rate amongst black and

987
00:38:46.276 --> 00:38:47.901
the death rate amongst black and
Asian minority ethnic people being

988
00:38:47.901 --> 00:38:50.360
Asian minority ethnic people being
twice that once you take into

989
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.943
twice that once you take into
account numerous factors, twice that

990
00:38:52.943 --> 00:38:57.651
account numerous factors, twice that
of white people, in terms of their

991
00:38:57.651 --> 00:38:57.985
of white peopla, in terms of their
risk, does

992
00:38:57.985 --> 00:39:01.485
of white people, in terms of their
risk, does that in any sense affect

993
00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:03.651
risk, does that in any sense affect
either protective measures or

994
00:39:03.651 --> 00:39:06.443
either protective measures or
lockdown, do you think? We have

995
00:39:06.443 --> 00:39:07.568
lockdown, do you think? We have
regional disparities and a

996
00:39:07.568 --> 00:39:09.151
regional disparities and a
remarkable disparity in ethnicity

997
00:39:09.151 --> 00:39:10.110
remarkabla disparity in ethnicity
and, as you

998
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.068
remarkable disparity in ethnicity
and, as you said, today, figures

999
00:39:11.068 --> 00:39:13.443
and, as you said, today, figures
show that, if you are a black man in

1000
00:39:13.443 --> 00:39:14.735
show that, if you are a black man in
this country, you are four times

1001
00:39:14.735 --> 00:39:19.651
this country, you are four times
more likely to die. And, if you

1002
00:39:19.651 --> 00:39:20.568
more likely to die. And, if you
account for socio— economic factors

1003
00:39:20.568 --> 00:39:21.193
account for socio- economic factors
like

1004
00:39:21.193 --> 00:39:22.568
account for socio— economic factors
like self—reported health

1005
00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:26.776
like self—reported health
conditions, poverty, they are still

1006
00:39:26.776 --> 00:39:28.818
conditions, poverty, they are still
twice as likely to die. This has not

1007
00:39:28.818 --> 00:39:32.526
twice as likely to die. This has not
been explained. Some of us from the

1008
00:39:32.526 --> 00:39:34.860
been explained. Some of us from the
beginning, from the first anecdotal

1009
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.193
beginning, from the first anecdotal
evidence, have been asking for a

1010
00:39:36.193 --> 00:39:39.026
evidence, have been asking for a
concerted effort to understand why

1011
00:39:39.026 --> 00:39:40.151
concerted effort to understand why
certain ethnic groups appear to be

1012
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:42.526
certain ethnic groups appear to be
so much more at risk. There is an

1013
00:39:42.526 --> 00:39:46.318
so much more at risk. There is an
enquiry going on. Custom and there

1014
00:39:46.318 --> 00:39:48.235
enquiry going on. Custom and there
is more data emerging. I have major

1015
00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:50.151
is more data emerging. I have major
issues with the government enquiry

1016
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:51.776
issues with the government enquiry
and its failure to gain trust among

1017
00:39:51.776 --> 00:39:53.943
and its failure to gain trust among
the affected communities so far. But

1018
00:39:53.943 --> 00:39:56.526
the affected communities so far. But
my issue is this, really. If we are

1019
00:39:56.526 --> 00:39:57.693
my issue is this, really. If we are
to start easing restrictions,

1020
00:39:57.693 --> 00:40:01.693
to start easing restrictions,
measures will be taken when people

1021
00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:02.151
measures will be taken when peopla
return to

1022
00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:03.568
measures will be taken when people
return to work to protect them? I

1023
00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:05.651
return to work to protect them? I
have heard the NHS has told

1024
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:06.860
have heard the NHS has told
employers in the NHS to take

1025
00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.151
employers in the NHS to take
necessary measures to protect ethnic

1026
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:11.901
necessary measures to protect ethnic
minority staff in light of the data,

1027
00:40:11.901 --> 00:40:15.235
minority staff in light of the data,
but there has been no consistent

1028
00:40:15.235 --> 00:40:17.610
but there has been no consistent
message about what employers should

1029
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.693
message about what employers should
do, knowing that their ethnic

1030
00:40:18.693 --> 00:40:20.693
do, knowing that their ethnic
minority staff are more likely to

1031
00:40:20.693 --> 00:40:22.276
minority staff are more likely to
die, to remove them from front—line

1032
00:40:22.276 --> 00:40:22.818
die, to remove them from front-line
duties and put

1033
00:40:22.818 --> 00:40:23.318
die, to remove them from front—line
duties and put extra precautionary

1034
00:40:23.318 --> 00:40:25.860
duties and put extra precautionary
measures in place not doing that is

1035
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.068
measures in place not doing that is
active neglect. That applies to the

1036
00:40:28.068 --> 00:40:31.110
active neglect. That applies to the
workforce in general. I am not

1037
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.735
workforce in general. I am not
confident there has been clear

1038
00:40:32.735 --> 00:40:33.860
confident there has been clear
messaging from the government about

1039
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.318
messaging from the government about
what employers should do to keep

1040
00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:36.443
what employers should do to keep
their workers safe if we start

1041
00:40:36.443 --> 00:40:39.276
their workers safe if we start
returning to work. There are

1042
00:40:39.276 --> 00:40:39.568
returning to work. There are
non-binding

1043
00:40:39.568 --> 00:40:40.068
returning to work. There are
non—binding guidelines and ideas,

1044
00:40:40.068 --> 00:40:40.276
non-binding guidelines and ideas,
but

1045
00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:41.985
non—binding guidelines and ideas,
but there is nothing to say, this

1046
00:40:41.985 --> 00:40:43.568
but there is nothing to say, this
categorically must happen to protect

1047
00:40:43.568 --> 00:40:47.860
categorically must happen to protect
workers. I think we may get to that

1048
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.735
workers. I think we may get to that
a bit further down the programme

1049
00:40:50.735 --> 00:40:51.818
a bit further down the programme
George, there is Saskia’s question

1050
00:40:51.818 --> 00:40:55.318
George, there is Saskia’s question
about whether it’s appropriate to

1051
00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:57.901
about whether it’s appropriate to
ease the lockdown differently in

1052
00:40:57.901 --> 00:40:59.651
ease the lockdown differently in
different areas and what Afua was

1053
00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:00.860
different areas and what Afua was
saying in terms of protecting ethnic

1054
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.485
saying in terms of protecting ethnic
minorities. On the first point, as

1055
00:41:05.485 --> 00:41:06.776
minorities. On the first point, as
Chris said, I think it’s preferable

1056
00:41:06.776 --> 00:41:08.276
Chris said, I think it’s preferable
to try and have a single approach

1057
00:41:08.276 --> 00:41:08.443
to try and have a singla approach
because

1058
00:41:08.443 --> 00:41:09.235
to try and have a single approach
because otherwise it gets confusing.

1059
00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:12.193
because otherwise it gets confusing.
And some of the advice from the

1060
00:41:12.193 --> 00:41:13.276
And some of the advice from the
Chief Medical Officer is that,

1061
00:41:13.276 --> 00:41:16.026
Chief Medical Officer is that,
although the prevalence can be

1062
00:41:16.026 --> 00:41:17.360
although the prevalence can be
different in different parts of the

1063
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.443
different in different parts of the
country, the so—called R rate is

1064
00:41:21.443 --> 00:41:22.401
country, the so-ralled R rate is
quite similar

1065
00:41:22.401 --> 00:41:23.193
country, the so—called R rate is
quite similar across the country, so

1066
00:41:23.193 --> 00:41:24.193
quite similar across the country, so
the argument for having very

1067
00:41:24.193 --> 00:41:24.943
the argument for having very
different approaches probably isn’t

1068
00:41:24.943 --> 00:41:28.318
different approaches probably isn’t
very strong. But there are parts of

1069
00:41:28.318 --> 00:41:30.401
very strong. But there are parts of
the country that have a lot of

1070
00:41:30.401 --> 00:41:32.651
the country that have a lot of
tourism, so there are issues about

1071
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:35.151
tourism, so there are issues about
how we exit lockdown which sectors

1072
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:38.318
how we exit lockdown which sectors
of the economy to try and

1073
00:41:38.318 --> 00:41:39.901
of the economy to try and
tentatively open and at which stage,

1074
00:41:39.901 --> 00:41:41.360
tentatively open and at which stage,
and these are factors that will be

1075
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.568
and these are factors that will be
taken into account in that context.

1076
00:41:46.568 --> 00:41:48.401
taken into account in that context.
Much the lockdown be lifted slightly

1077
00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:49.568
Much the lockdown be lifted slightly
more in places like Cornwall and

1078
00:41:49.568 --> 00:41:53.068
more in places like Cornwall and
Devon? The Prime Minister will give

1079
00:41:53.068 --> 00:41:54.443
Devon? The Prime Minister will give
his statement on Sunday. The key

1080
00:41:54.443 --> 00:42:00.193
his statement on Sunday. The key
thing is... Is that what you expect?

1081
00:42:00.193 --> 00:42:01.860
thing is... Is that what you expect?
Everybody has to observe the current

1082
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.943
Everybody has to observe the current
restrictions but I think the Prime

1083
00:42:02.943 --> 00:42:04.276
restrictions but I think the Prime
Minister has already signalled that

1084
00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:04.485
Minister has already signallad that
what

1085
00:42:04.485 --> 00:42:06.818
Minister has already signalled that
what he is likely to outline on

1086
00:42:06.818 --> 00:42:08.651
what he is likely to outline on
Sunday is, if you like, a route map

1087
00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:08.943
Sunday is, ifyou like, a route map
about how

1088
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:11.443
Sunday is, if you like, a route map
about how we can evolve this policy

1089
00:42:11.443 --> 00:42:11.901
about how we ran evolve this policy
for we

1090
00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:13.193
about how we can evolve this policy
for we will be very cautious because

1091
00:42:13.193 --> 00:42:13.860
for we will be very cautious because
we are dearty

1092
00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.818
for we will be very cautious because
we are clearly not out of the woods

1093
00:42:14.818 --> 00:42:15.651
we are dearty not out of the woods
on this by any

1094
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:18.068
we are clearly not out of the woods
on this by any means. But I think we

1095
00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:19.735
on this by any means. But I think we
are expecting a bit more than a

1096
00:42:19.735 --> 00:42:21.443
are expecting a bit more than a
route map. He said, the reason we

1097
00:42:21.443 --> 00:42:22.568
route map. He said, the reason we
are making the announcement on

1098
00:42:22.568 --> 00:42:24.235
are making the announcement on
Sunday so we can get going with some

1099
00:42:24.235 --> 00:42:24.651
Sunday so we ran get going with some
of the

1100
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:26.360
Sunday so we can get going with some
of the measures on Monday, so from

1101
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.526
of the measures on Monday, so from
what he said something will happen

1102
00:42:27.526 --> 00:42:30.860
what he said something will happen
on Monday. Some things might happen,

1103
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.651
on Monday. Some things might happen,
but we will be very cautious about

1104
00:42:32.651 --> 00:42:34.860
but we will be very cautious about
what happens and what timetable.

1105
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.610
what happens and what timetabla.
This is

1106
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.943
what happens and what timetable.
This is not going to be a single

1107
00:42:36.943 --> 00:42:38.610
This is not going to be a single
announcement that that is the end of

1108
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.860
announcement that that is the end of
the lockdown and everything is back

1109
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.526
the lockdown and everything is back
to normal. I don’t think anybody

1110
00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:45.985
to normal. I don’t think anybody
expects that. We will have to live

1111
00:42:45.985 --> 00:42:47.443
expects that. We will have to live
with this virus for some time and

1112
00:42:47.443 --> 00:42:50.443
with this virus for some time and
that means we will have to have a

1113
00:42:50.443 --> 00:42:51.443
that means we will have to have a
gradual approach to loosening some

1114
00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:56.860
gradual approach to loosening some
of these restrictions. Juergen

1115
00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.401
of these restrictions. juergen
Maier,

1116
00:42:57.401 --> 00:42:58.818
of these restrictions. Juergen
Maier, Saskia is asking about a

1117
00:42:58.818 --> 00:42:59.818
Maier, Saskia is asking about a
different way of easing restrictions

1118
00:42:59.818 --> 00:43:02.151
different way of easing restrictions
depending on where you live. I am

1119
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:04.943
depending on where you live. I am
with Nick on this. We went in it

1120
00:43:04.943 --> 00:43:06.443
with Nick on this. We went in it
together, messaging wasn’t quite

1121
00:43:06.443 --> 00:43:10.318
together, messaging wasn’t quite
clear enough and as we come out I

1122
00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:12.901
clear enough and as we come out I
think we have to be together to help

1123
00:43:12.901 --> 00:43:15.943
think we have to be together to help
simplify the messaging. That doesn’t

1124
00:43:15.943 --> 00:43:18.401
simplify the messaging. That doesn’t
mean that we can’t then have

1125
00:43:18.401 --> 00:43:19.276
mean that we can’t then have
different interventions in different

1126
00:43:19.276 --> 00:43:21.901
different interventions in different
parts of the country, so the rules

1127
00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:22.276
parts of the country, so the mles
are the

1128
00:43:22.276 --> 00:43:24.901
parts of the country, so the rules
are the same for everybody but, if

1129
00:43:24.901 --> 00:43:26.651
are the same for everybody but, if
in Newcastle, which was the example

1130
00:43:26.651 --> 00:43:28.985
in Newcastle, which was the example
that was used, you have a flare—up,

1131
00:43:28.985 --> 00:43:30.443
that was used, you have a ﬂare-up,
then that is

1132
00:43:30.443 --> 00:43:31.276
that was used, you have a flare—up,
then that is where you move more

1133
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.651
then that is where you move more
testing capacity, that is where you

1134
00:43:32.651 --> 00:43:35.568
testing capacity, that is where you
move more of the track and tracers,

1135
00:43:35.568 --> 00:43:38.568
move more of the track and tracers,
and I think also in terms of what

1136
00:43:38.568 --> 00:43:41.943
and I think also in terms of what
Afua was saying, we also need to say

1137
00:43:41.943 --> 00:43:44.860
Afua was saying, we also need to say
there is evidence that clearly black

1138
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.443
there is evidence that dearty black
men are

1139
00:43:45.443 --> 00:43:45.985
there is evidence that clearly black
men are unfortunately more

1140
00:43:45.985 --> 00:43:47.651
men are unfortunately more
vulnerable in this situation, so we

1141
00:43:47.651 --> 00:43:49.026
vulnerable in this situation, so we
need to be much more supportive to

1142
00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:51.026
need to be much more supportive to
black men and make testing available

1143
00:43:51.026 --> 00:43:56.068
black men and make testing available
to black men and make sure we have

1144
00:43:56.068 --> 00:43:56.651
to black men and make sure we have
got those earty

1145
00:43:56.651 --> 00:43:56.860
to black men and make sure we have
got those early interventions,

1146
00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.068
got those earty interventions,
certainly

1147
00:43:57.068 --> 00:43:58.860
got those early interventions,
certainly until we get to the point

1148
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.693
certainly until we get to the point
where we have got more science to

1149
00:44:00.693 --> 00:44:03.943
where we have got more science to
understand why this is happening.

1150
00:44:03.943 --> 00:44:07.276
understand why this is happening.
I’d like to add, black men have the

1151
00:44:07.276 --> 00:44:08.651
I’d like to add, black men have the
most serious disparity, but many

1152
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:12.943
most serious disparity, but many
ethnic groups, could block of

1153
00:44:12.943 --> 00:44:13.651
ethnic groups, could block of
Pakistani heritage, Bangladeshi

1154
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:14.860
Pakistani heritage, Bangladeshi
heritage, black and Asian women are

1155
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.193
heritage, black and Asian women are
more likely to die from Covid, so

1156
00:44:18.193 --> 00:44:20.610
more likely to die from Covid, so
there is quite a wide number of

1157
00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.443
there is quite a wide number of
different ethnic minority

1158
00:44:21.443 --> 00:44:22.526
different ethnic minority
communities whose lives are at

1159
00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:23.693
communities whose lives are at
stake, so it couldn’t be more

1160
00:44:23.693 --> 00:44:25.026
stake, so it couldn’t be more
serious. I

1161
00:44:25.026 --> 00:44:26.526
stake, so it couldn’t be more
serious. Ifeel there was

1162
00:44:26.526 --> 00:44:26.860
stake, so it couldn’t be more
serious. I feel there was a real

1163
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.193
serious. I feel there was a real
lack of intellectual curiosity from

1164
00:44:28.193 --> 00:44:28.401
lack of intellactual curiosity from
the

1165
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:29.526
lack of intellectual curiosity from
the government about why this was

1166
00:44:29.526 --> 00:44:31.818
the government about why this was
happening to stop it took a

1167
00:44:31.818 --> 00:44:32.818
happening to stop it took a
concerted and consistent effort from

1168
00:44:32.818 --> 00:44:34.776
concerted and consistent effort from
campaigners and journalists like me

1169
00:44:34.776 --> 00:44:35.193
campaigners and journalists like me
falling

1170
00:44:35.193 --> 00:44:36.151
campaigners and journalists like me
calling upon the covenant to take

1171
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:38.193
calling upon the covenant to take
this seriously and it was weeks

1172
00:44:38.193 --> 00:44:40.235
this seriously and it was weeks
before we had any interests, let

1173
00:44:40.235 --> 00:44:41.193
before we had any interests, let
alone an enquiry, and I

1174
00:44:41.193 --> 00:44:41.568
before we had any interests, let
alone an enquiry, and Ifeel eyes

1175
00:44:41.568 --> 00:44:41.776
alone an enquiry, and I feel eyes
could

1176
00:44:41.776 --> 00:44:43.693
alone an enquiry, and Ifeel eyes
could have been saved if this was

1177
00:44:43.693 --> 00:44:46.901
could have been saved if this was
taken seriously at an earlier stage.

1178
00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:47.860
taken seriously at an eartier stage.
This isn’t

1179
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.151
taken seriously at an earlier stage.
This isn’t true, is a new virus and

1180
00:44:49.151 --> 00:44:50.568
This isn’t true, is a new virus and
we are learning new things all the

1181
00:44:50.568 --> 00:44:52.860
we are learning new things all the
time for the Matt Hancock set up a

1182
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.193
time for the Matt Hancock set up a
review to look at these issues, and

1183
00:44:54.193 --> 00:44:56.235
review to look at these issues, and
it isn’t just BME

1184
00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:56.776
review to look at these issues, and
it isn’tjust BME communities where

1185
00:44:56.776 --> 00:44:56.860
it isn’t just BME communities where
there

1186
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.151
it isn’tjust BME communities where
there seems to be a higher incidence

1187
00:44:58.151 --> 00:45:00.401
there seems to be a higher incidence
of the virus and more deaths, there

1188
00:45:00.401 --> 00:45:03.610
of the virus and more deaths, there
are big links with obesity to deaths

1189
00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.818
are big links with obesity to deaths
from the virus, men are more likely

1190
00:45:05.818 --> 00:45:07.735
from the virus, men are more likely
than women to die from the virus, so

1191
00:45:07.735 --> 00:45:08.901
than women to die from the virus, so
there are many other factors that

1192
00:45:08.901 --> 00:45:12.318
there are many other factors that
need to be looked at. Let’s take

1193
00:45:12.318 --> 00:45:13.276
need to be looked at. Let’s take
another question from Charles

1194
00:45:13.276 --> 00:45:16.568
another question from Charles
Dobson. I’m apprehensive about

1195
00:45:16.568 --> 00:45:20.193
Dobson. I’m apprehensive about
returning to work hot—desk king is

1196
00:45:20.193 --> 00:45:20.568
returning to work hot-desk king is
prevalent and

1197
00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:21.110
returning to work hot—desk king is
prevalent and colleagues less than

1198
00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:24.693
prevalent and colleagues less than
two metres away. Can you outline

1199
00:45:24.693 --> 00:45:24.901
two metres away. (“an you outline
what

1200
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:25.860
two metres away. Can you outline
what precautions the government are

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:30.026
what precautions the government are
proposing to ensure safety at work?

proposing to ensure safety at work?
I am apprehensive, he says, about

1203
00:45:31.776 --> 00:45:33.568
I am apprehensive, he says, about
returning to work, where hot—desk

outline what precautions the
government are proposing to ensure

1210
00:45:40.068 --> 00:45:44.568
government are proposing to ensure
safety at work? Juergen Maier, you

1211
00:45:44.568 --> 00:45:45.193
safety at work? juergen Maier, you
are not mnning

1212
00:45:45.193 --> 00:45:45.985
safety at work? Juergen Maier, you
are not running Siemens but you are

1213
00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:46.318
are not mnning Siemens but you are
involved in

1214
00:45:46.318 --> 00:45:47.693
are not running Siemens but you are
involved in other companies. What is

1215
00:45:47.693 --> 00:45:48.318
involved in other companies. what is
your view about

1216
00:45:48.318 --> 00:45:50.485
involved in other companies. What is
your view about how this should go

1217
00:45:50.485 --> 00:45:53.651
your view about how this should go
ahead, for people like Charles? He

1218
00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:54.443
ahead, for peopla like Charlas? He
will not

1219
00:45:54.443 --> 00:45:55.443
ahead, for people like Charles? He
will not be the only one anxious

1220
00:45:55.443 --> 00:45:58.276
will not be the only one anxious
about how to feel safe at work.

1221
00:45:58.276 --> 00:45:59.735
about how to feel safe at work.
Absolutely, and it’s such a perfect

1222
00:45:59.735 --> 00:46:03.193
Absolutely, and it’s such a perfect
question, because there are millions

1223
00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:05.860
question, because there are millions
of people feeling in exactly the

1224
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.193
of people feeling in exactly the
same way, and what’s certainly

1225
00:46:08.193 --> 00:46:08.568
same way, and what’s certainly
needed

1226
00:46:08.568 --> 00:46:08.776
same way, and what’s certainly
neededin

1227
00:46:08.776 --> 00:46:09.610
same way, and what’s certainly
needed in the statement on Sunday

1228
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.568
needed in the statement on Sunday
and the plans we get thereafter is

1229
00:46:12.568 --> 00:46:14.151
and the plans we get thereafter is
really, really good guidance on how

1230
00:46:14.151 --> 00:46:16.860
really, really good guidance on how
safety in the workplace is going to

1231
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.193
safety in the workplace is going to
be ensured.

1232
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.693
be ensured. There are obviously
things that can be done and a lot of

1233
00:46:25.693 --> 00:46:26.068
things that ran be done and a lot of
the economy

1234
00:46:26.068 --> 00:46:28.235
things that can be done and a lot of
the economy and it is working today.

1235
00:46:28.235 --> 00:46:30.068
the economy and it is working today.
The retail sector is working,

1236
00:46:30.068 --> 00:46:32.068
The retail sector is working,
transport sectors are working. So we

1237
00:46:32.068 --> 00:46:32.401
transport sectors are working. So we
learn from

1238
00:46:32.401 --> 00:46:33.735
transport sectors are working. 50 we
learn from those, and we make sure

1239
00:46:33.735 --> 00:46:35.818
learn from those, and we make sure
we are putting the absolute right

1240
00:46:35.818 --> 00:46:37.401
we are putting the absolute right
measures in place. You mention the

1241
00:46:37.401 --> 00:46:38.818
measures in place. You mention the
example of hot testing. I think one

1242
00:46:38.818 --> 00:46:41.443
example of hot testing. I think one
of the rules in offices will be that

1243
00:46:41.443 --> 00:46:42.026
of the mles in offices will be that
what testing

1244
00:46:42.026 --> 00:46:44.651
of the rules in offices will be that
what testing is not allowed, because

1245
00:46:44.651 --> 00:46:48.068
what testing is not allowed, because
that is obviously the sharing of

1246
00:46:48.068 --> 00:46:49.235
that is obviously the sharing of
equipment, or certainly, you know,

1247
00:46:49.235 --> 00:46:50.818
equipment, or certainly, you know,
there would have to be a lot of

1248
00:46:50.818 --> 00:46:51.735
there would have to be a lot of
sanitising in between, but these

1249
00:46:51.735 --> 00:46:54.068
sanitising in between, but these
guidelines are going to have to be

1250
00:46:54.068 --> 00:46:55.901
guidelines are going to have to be
crystal clear so we get a huge

1251
00:46:55.901 --> 00:46:57.235
crystal clear so we get a huge
amount of confidence, and there also

1252
00:46:57.235 --> 00:47:03.985
amount of confidence, and there also
needs to be some policing of that.

1253
00:47:03.985 --> 00:47:05.776
needs to be some policing of that.
And every company knows how to do

1254
00:47:05.776 --> 00:47:06.860
And every company knows how to do
risk assessments to keep people safe

1255
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.610
risk assessments to keep people safe
at work, and I think the same rules

1256
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.318
at work, and I think the same mles
apply here and

1257
00:47:09.318 --> 00:47:11.068
at work, and I think the same rules
apply here and we have a Health and

1258
00:47:11.068 --> 00:47:13.443
apply here and we have a Health and
Safety Executive that can help

1259
00:47:13.443 --> 00:47:14.901
Safety Executive that can help
enforced at and make sure they are

1260
00:47:14.901 --> 00:47:16.026
enforced at and make sure they are
working together with businesses and

1261
00:47:16.026 --> 00:47:19.318
working together with businesses and
we are creating the right safe

1262
00:47:19.318 --> 00:47:21.318
we are creating the right safe
working environment. Nick, do you

1263
00:47:21.318 --> 00:47:23.651
working environment. Nick, do you
think the guidelines, sorry, not

1264
00:47:23.651 --> 00:47:24.943
think the guidelines, sorry, not
guidelines, but the provisions put

1265
00:47:24.943 --> 00:47:27.193
guidelines, but the provisions put
in place for employees should be

1266
00:47:27.193 --> 00:47:30.985
in place for employees should be
legally binding? Well, I don’t think

1267
00:47:30.985 --> 00:47:31.401
lagally binding? Well, I don’t think
the

1268
00:47:31.401 --> 00:47:33.026
legally binding? Well, I don’t think
the guidelines that have been

1269
00:47:33.026 --> 00:47:34.693
the guidelines that have been
suggested so far are sufficiently

1270
00:47:34.693 --> 00:47:36.735
suggested so far are sufficiently
precise and I think you absolutely

1271
00:47:36.735 --> 00:47:37.943
precise and I think you absolutely
need better enforcement. But we’ve

1272
00:47:37.943 --> 00:47:41.401
need better enforcement. But we’ve
been arguing for a national safety

1273
00:47:41.401 --> 00:47:43.818
been arguing for a national safety
standard, and we are putting that

1274
00:47:43.818 --> 00:47:46.026
standard, and we are putting that
together with employers, with the

1275
00:47:46.026 --> 00:47:47.860
together with employers, with the
TUC, and of course across political

1276
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.776
TUC, and of course across political
parties so everybody can have

1277
00:47:50.776 --> 00:47:51.860
parties so everybody can have
confidence, whether employers,

1278
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.235
confidence, whether employers,
employees, everybody in the

1279
00:47:53.235 --> 00:47:54.526
employees, everybody in the
workplace, they can be sure going

1280
00:47:54.526 --> 00:47:54.901
workplace, they ran be sure going
back to

1281
00:47:54.901 --> 00:47:57.985
workplace, they can be sure going
back to work. I think there needs to

1282
00:47:57.985 --> 00:48:00.860
back to work. I think there needs to
be, yes, a recognition that

1283
00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:01.568
be, yes, a recognition that
workplaces are different. But we

1284
00:48:01.568 --> 00:48:02.901
workplaces are different. But we
need to be risk assessing our

1285
00:48:02.901 --> 00:48:07.818
need to be risk assessing our
workplaces, we need to be looking at

1286
00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.693
workplaces, we need to be looking at
distancing, weather screens,

1287
00:48:09.693 --> 00:48:12.276
distancing, weather screens,
supplying the appropriate personal

1288
00:48:12.276 --> 00:48:12.985
supplying the appropriate personal
equipment, and then along

1289
00:48:12.985 --> 00:48:14.651
supplying the appropriate personal
equipment, and then alongside

1290
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:14.860
supplying the appropriate personal
equipment, and then along side that

1291
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.193
equipment, and then along side that
we absolutely need an enforcement

1292
00:48:17.193 --> 00:48:20.485
we absolutely need an enforcement
mechanism, and quite rightly

1293
00:48:20.485 --> 00:48:21.276
we absolutely need an enforcement
mechanism, and quite rightlyJuergen

1294
00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:21.651
mechanism, and quite rightly juergen
mention

1295
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:22.610
mechanism, and quite rightlyJuergen
mention the Health and Safety

1296
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:23.985
mention the Health and Safety
Executive and there are local

1297
00:48:23.985 --> 00:48:25.860
Executive and there are local
authorities as well of course but

1298
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.235
authorities as well of course but
what we really need is sufficient

1299
00:48:27.235 --> 00:48:29.443
what we really need is sufficient
resource available for that

1300
00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:30.693
resource available for that
enforcement to take place. If that

1301
00:48:30.693 --> 00:48:31.193
enforcement to take place. If that
is the use,

1302
00:48:31.193 --> 00:48:33.693
enforcement to take place. If that
is the case, then we can have

1303
00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:34.860
is the case, then we can have
confidence going forward that people

1304
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.276
confidence going forward that peopla
do feel

1305
00:48:35.276 --> 00:48:37.860
confidence going forward that people
do feel safe going to work, and

1306
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.068
do feel safe going to work, and
employers as well feel certain about

1307
00:48:39.068 --> 00:48:41.943
employers as well feel certain about
what they are required to do. On

1308
00:48:41.943 --> 00:48:45.901
what they are required to do. On
that subject, we have had a tweet in

1309
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:46.276
that subject, we have had a tweet in
from [aura

1310
00:48:46.276 --> 00:48:48.193
that subject, we have had a tweet in
from Laura Herod. If and when the

1311
00:48:48.193 --> 00:48:48.443
from [aura Herod. If and when the
schools

1312
00:48:48.443 --> 00:48:49.735
from Laura Herod. If and when the
schools return, obviously teachers

1313
00:48:49.735 --> 00:48:51.860
schools return, obviously teachers
are key employees as well, will

1314
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.860
are key employees as well, will
teachers be expected to wear PPE?

1315
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.860
teachers be expected to wear PPE?
Act delete my Nick was referring to

1316
00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.651
Act delete my Nick was referring to
PPE. Afua? I

1317
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:00.193
Act delete my Nick was referring to
PPE. Afua? Ithink

1318
00:49:00.193 --> 00:49:00.860
Act delete my Nick was referring to
PPE. Afua? I think this is where

1319
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:06.360
PPE. Afua? I think this is where
trust comes

1320
00:49:06.693 --> 00:49:08.860
trust comes in —— and Nick was

1321
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.026
trust comes in -- and Nick was
referring to PPE.

1322
00:49:11.026 --> 00:49:12.901
trust comes in —— and Nick was
referring to PPE. I have seen

1323
00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:13.860
referring to PPE. I have seen
unions, workers groups, already

1324
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.276
unions, workers groups, already
voicing quite extreme concern about

1325
00:49:15.276 --> 00:49:17.360
voicing quite extreme concern about
whether they will be protected when

1326
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.068
whether they will be protected when
they return to work. Amidst this we

1327
00:49:19.068 --> 00:49:20.526
they return to work. Amidst this we
have the spectre of the people on

1328
00:49:20.526 --> 00:49:21.735
have the spectre of the people on
the front line not being properly

1329
00:49:21.735 --> 00:49:21.943
the front line not being property
protected

1330
00:49:21.943 --> 00:49:23.651
the front line not being properly
protected so there is a real sense

1331
00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:25.860
protected so there is a real sense
that people’s lives are being put

1332
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.651
that people’s lives are being put
unnecessarily at risk, and I’m as

1333
00:49:27.651 --> 00:49:30.485
unnecessarily at risk, and I’m as
keen as everybody else to be able to

1334
00:49:30.485 --> 00:49:31.860
keen as everybody else to be able to
get back to some semblance of

1335
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.485
get back to some semblance of
normality, for my daughter to return

1336
00:49:33.485 --> 00:49:35.443
normality, for my daughter to return
to school, but on the other hand I

1337
00:49:35.443 --> 00:49:36.943
to school, but on the other hand I
think we do need those assurances

1338
00:49:36.943 --> 00:49:38.818
think we do need those assurances
that we will be kept safe and I

1339
00:49:38.818 --> 00:49:41.235
that we will be kept safe and I
think they need to be crystal clear,

1340
00:49:41.235 --> 00:49:42.318
think they need to be crystal clear,
as juergen

1341
00:49:42.318 --> 00:49:42.985
think they need to be crystal clear,
asJuergen said, really important

1342
00:49:42.985 --> 00:49:43.485
as juergen said, really important
phrase. But

1343
00:49:43.485 --> 00:49:45.735
asJuergen said, really important
phrase. But also they need to be

1344
00:49:45.735 --> 00:49:47.401
phrase. But also they need to be
binding because we know there are

1345
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:48.485
binding because we know there are
employers who will float good

1346
00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:48.860
employers who will ﬂoat good
practice

1347
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.526
employers who will float good
practice and we know we don’t have a

1348
00:49:50.526 --> 00:49:52.735
practice and we know we don’t have a
perfect record of safety at work, so

1349
00:49:52.735 --> 00:49:54.985
perfect record of safety at work, so
this is the time for those standards

1350
00:49:54.985 --> 00:49:56.651
this is the time for those standards
to be increased and heightened and

1351
00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:59.860
to be increased and heightened and
made crystal clear and not to be

1352
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.068
made crystal clear and not to be
optional. We have had another

1353
00:50:02.068 --> 00:50:04.860
optional. We have had another
comment in on workplace guidance on

1354
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.276
comment in on workplace guidance on
coronavims,

1355
00:50:05.276 --> 00:50:06.985
comment in on workplace guidance on
coronavirus, should they be legally

1356
00:50:06.985 --> 00:50:07.485
coronavims, should they be lagally
binding or

1357
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:08.360
coronavirus, should they be legally
binding or optional extras? I think

1358
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.151
binding or optional extras? I think
we need to be careful about making

1359
00:50:10.151 --> 00:50:11.693
we need to be careful about making
the assumption it is all on the

1360
00:50:11.693 --> 00:50:13.860
the assumption it is all on the
guidelines. Can I share my dilemma

1361
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.110
guidelines. (“an I share my dilamma
as

1362
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:14.276
guidelines. (“an I share my dilemma
as the

1363
00:50:14.276 --> 00:50:15.485
guidelines. Can I share my dilemma
as the chief executive of an

00:50:15.485 --> 00:50:17.568
as the chief executive of an
organisations? We only have 60

1365
00:50:17.568 --> 00:50:19.026
organisations? We only have 60
staff, but our office is really

1366
00:50:19.026 --> 00:50:20.901
staff, but our office is really
quite difficult because we have a

1367
00:50:20.901 --> 00:50:21.860
quite difficult because we have a
really narrow corridor which

1368
00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.568
really narrow corridor which
effectively enables people to get to

1369
00:50:23.568 --> 00:50:25.151
effectively enables people to get to
and from their desk. There is no way

1370
00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:26.943
and from their desk. There is no way
we will be able to observe social

1371
00:50:26.943 --> 00:50:30.110
we will be able to observe social
distancing... Or have a one—way

1372
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:30.735
distancing... Or have a one-way
system. Yeah,

1373
00:50:30.735 --> 00:50:31.860
distancing... Or have a one—way
system. Yeah, you can have all the

1374
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:32.485
system. Yeah, you ran have all the
guidelines you

1375
00:50:32.485 --> 00:50:33.318
system. Yeah, you can have all the
guidelines you like, but what

1376
00:50:33.318 --> 00:50:35.860
guidelines you like, but what
actually you also need is you need

1377
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.151
actually you also need is you need
leaders of organisations who think

1378
00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:38.860
leaders of organisations who think
that the welfare of their staff is

1379
00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.860
that the welfare of their staff is
by far the most important thing, and

1380
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.485
by far the most important thing, and
certainly that is the way we act as

1381
00:50:43.485 --> 00:50:45.443
certainly that is the way we act as
our senior leadership team in our

1382
00:50:45.443 --> 00:50:46.568
our senior leadership team in our
organisation, but also need the

1383
00:50:46.568 --> 00:50:47.901
organisation, but also need the
ingenuity of staff to help you do

1384
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:51.735
ingenuity of staff to help you do
things like work out how would you

1385
00:50:51.735 --> 00:50:54.610
things like work out how would you
create a one—way system... Do you

1386
00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:54.776
create a one-way system... Do you
think

1387
00:50:54.776 --> 00:50:55.401
create a one—way system... Do you
think these things, because

1388
00:50:55.401 --> 00:50:56.610
think these things, because
obviously you are talking about the

1389
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:56.985
obviously you are talking about the
peopla in

1390
00:50:56.985 --> 00:50:57.985
obviously you are talking about the
people in your office, but when it

1391
00:50:57.985 --> 00:50:58.901
peopla in your office, but when it
comes to Andy

1392
00:50:58.901 --> 00:50:59.651
people in your office, but when it
comes to Andy Lynch workers,

1393
00:50:59.651 --> 00:51:00.985
comes to Andy Lynch workers,
community trust, hospital workers,

1394
00:51:00.985 --> 00:51:03.443
community trust, hospital workers,
your obviously here is the face of

1395
00:51:03.443 --> 00:51:04.276
your obviously here is the face of
that --

1396
00:51:04.276 --> 00:51:05.276
your obviously here is the face of
that —— when it comes to ambulance

1397
00:51:05.276 --> 00:51:06.860
that -- when it comes to ambulance
workers. Do you

1398
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.235
that —— when it comes to ambulance
workers. Do you think these

1399
00:51:07.235 --> 00:51:08.901
workers. Do you think these
protections for workers should be

1400
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:09.568
protections for workers should be
lagally

1401
00:51:09.568 --> 00:51:11.985
protections for workers should be
legally binding, as has been

1402
00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:12.443
legally binding, as has been
suggested, or

1403
00:51:12.443 --> 00:51:12.651
legally binding, as has been
suggested, oras

1404
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:12.985
legally binding, as has been
suggested, or as optional extras?

1405
00:51:12.985 --> 00:51:13.276
legally binding, as has been
suggested, oras optional extras? I

1406
00:51:13.276 --> 00:51:13.443
suggested, or as optional extras? I
don’t

1407
00:51:13.443 --> 00:51:15.026
suggested, oras optional extras? I
don’t think they should be optional

1408
00:51:15.026 --> 00:51:18.026
don’t think they should be optional
extras. I think we should absolutely

1409
00:51:18.026 --> 00:51:20.568
extras. I think we should absolutely
ensure that leader limit are held to

1410
00:51:20.568 --> 00:51:21.860
ensure that leader limit are held to
appropriate account for creating

1411
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.360
appropriate account for creating
safe workplaces. To be frank, that

1412
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.443
safe workplaces. To be frank, that
is what existing health and safety

1413
00:51:26.443 --> 00:51:26.610
is what existing health and safety
lagislation

1414
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:29.193
is what existing health and safety
legislation does. 50 that is legally

1415
00:51:29.193 --> 00:51:30.193
lagislation does. So that is lagally
binding? It

1416
00:51:30.193 --> 00:51:31.235
legislation does. 50 that is legally
binding? It is, and what we also

1417
00:51:31.235 --> 00:51:33.360
binding? It is, and what we also
know is life is now becoming really

1418
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.860
know is life is now becoming really
complex. I spoke to a hospital chief

1419
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.276
complex. I spoke to a hospital chief
exec the other day who literally had

1420
00:51:36.276 --> 00:51:40.235
exec the other day who literally had
to divide their hospital into a

1421
00:51:40.235 --> 00:51:41.151
to divide their hospital into a
Covid—19 zone and a non—Covid—19

1422
00:51:41.151 --> 00:51:41.568
Covid-19 zone and a non-Covid-19
zone and

1423
00:51:41.568 --> 00:51:43.235
Covid—19 zone and a non—Covid—19
zone and that has created some

1424
00:51:43.235 --> 00:51:44.068
zone and that has created some
really complicated issues. The

1425
00:51:44.068 --> 00:51:46.943
really complicated issues. The
classic example is we are all

1426
00:51:46.943 --> 00:51:48.651
classic example is we are all
saying, quite rightly, let’s restart

1427
00:51:48.651 --> 00:51:50.568
saying, quite rightly, let’s restart
all the elective surgery, for

1428
00:51:50.568 --> 00:51:51.360
all the elective surgery, for
example, but that particular

1429
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.360
example, but that particular
hospital will lose quite a lot of

1430
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.735
hospital will lose quite a lot of
its capacity because effectively it

1431
00:51:54.735 --> 00:51:59.068
its capacity because effectively it
has to divide that hospital into a

1432
00:51:59.068 --> 00:52:04.276
has to divide that hospital into a
safe Covid—19 zone a safe non—Covid

1433
00:52:04.276 --> 00:52:05.318
safe Covid-19 zone a safe non-Covid
zone, so there

for people to provide the proper

1438
00:52:10.735 --> 00:52:10.901

without fear of being laid off, it’s

been working with working with

note there are sectors of the

note there are sectors of the
economy that never shut down. The

economy that never shut down. The

coronavirus has fallen from a peak

1472
00:53:07.276 --> 00:53:08.901
coronavirus has fallen from a peak
of 20% at the very beginning of this

1473
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:09.026
of 2096 at the very beginning of this
episode

1474
00:53:09.026 --> 00:53:11.485
of 20% at the very beginning of this
episode about five weeks ago down to

1475
00:53:11.485 --> 00:53:12.985
episode about five weeks ago down to
about between 3—6% which is actually

1476
00:53:12.985 --> 00:53:14.985
about between 3-696 which is actually
quite close to

1477
00:53:14.985 --> 00:53:16.568
about between 3—6% which is actually
quite close to normal level. But

1478
00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:16.985
quite close to normal lavel. But
coming to

1479
00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:19.443
quite close to normal level. But
coming to Charles’s question,

1480
00:53:19.443 --> 00:53:19.818
coming to Charlas’s question,
though, ran

1481
00:53:19.818 --> 00:53:20.526
coming to Charles’s question,
though, can you outline what

1482
00:53:20.526 --> 00:53:20.651
though, ran you outline what
precautions

1483
00:53:20.651 --> 00:53:21.610
though, can you outline what
precautions the Government is

1484
00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.276
precautions the Government is
proposing to ensure safety at work?

1485
00:53:23.276 --> 00:53:23.901
proposing to ensure safety at work?
How ran you

1486
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:24.735
proposing to ensure safety at work?
How can you make someone like

1487
00:53:24.735 --> 00:53:25.026
How ran you make someone like
Charles

1488
00:53:25.026 --> 00:53:27.193
How can you make someone like
Charles feel safe? Are you going to

1489
00:53:27.193 --> 00:53:29.110
Charles feel safe? Are you going to
make it legally binding? As the TUC

1490
00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:29.443
make it lagally binding? As the TUC
was

1491
00:53:29.443 --> 00:53:30.735
make it legally binding? As the TUC
was suggesting you should. Or is it

1492
00:53:30.735 --> 00:53:32.110
was suggesting you should. Or is it
just going to be something you

1493
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:35.735
just going to be something you
expect companies to go along with?

1494
00:53:35.735 --> 00:53:37.985
expect companies to go along with?
Look, the difficulty of being too

1495
00:53:37.985 --> 00:53:38.985
Look, the difficulty of being too
prescriptive is that different

1496
00:53:38.985 --> 00:53:40.276
prescriptive is that different
businesses will have different

1497
00:53:40.276 --> 00:53:41.901
businesses will have different
approaches and so for instance in

1498
00:53:41.901 --> 00:53:43.568
approaches and so for instance in
the retail sector we discovered a

1499
00:53:43.568 --> 00:53:45.026
the retail sector we discovered a
small convenience store might have a

1500
00:53:45.026 --> 00:53:47.651
small convenience store might have a
very different approach to a large

1501
00:53:47.651 --> 00:53:48.485
very different approach to a large
supermarket, and the practicalities

1502
00:53:48.485 --> 00:53:51.276
supermarket, and the practicalities
of doing things are different and

1503
00:53:51.276 --> 00:53:52.401
of doing things are different and
large supermarkets for instance

1504
00:53:52.401 --> 00:53:54.818
large supermarkets for instance
might restrict cars going on at the

1505
00:53:54.818 --> 00:53:54.985
might restrict tars going on at the
entrance,

1506
00:53:54.985 --> 00:53:55.860
might restrict cars going on at the
entrance, and obviously a small

1507
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.985
entrance, and obviously a small
corner shop will take a different

1508
00:53:56.985 --> 00:53:58.276
corner shop will take a different
approach. You need to have enough

1509
00:53:58.276 --> 00:53:58.651
approach. You need to have enough
ﬂexibility for

1510
00:53:58.651 --> 00:53:59.610
approach. You need to have enough
flexibility for employers to be able

1511
00:53:59.610 --> 00:53:59.943
ﬂexibility for employers to be able
to do

1512
00:53:59.943 --> 00:54:01.276
flexibility for employers to be able
to do what works in their

1513
00:54:01.276 --> 00:54:02.901
to do what works in their
environment. I think in the office

1514
00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:04.568
environment. I think in the office
environment he cited with hot desk

1515
00:54:04.568 --> 00:54:04.901
environment he cited with hot desk
and, I

1516
00:54:04.901 --> 00:54:05.110
environment he cited with hot desk
and, Ithink

1517
00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:07.068
environment he cited with hot desk
and, I think the reality is there

1518
00:54:07.068 --> 00:54:10.401
and, I think the reality is there
will still be a strong encouragement

1519
00:54:10.401 --> 00:54:12.151
will still be a strong encouragement
of businesses that are office—based

1520
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:12.485
of businesses that are office-based
to

1521
00:54:12.485 --> 00:54:14.068
of businesses that are office—based
to enable people still to work from

1522
00:54:14.068 --> 00:54:14.735
to enabla peopla still to work from
home as

1523
00:54:14.735 --> 00:54:15.860
to enable people still to work from
home as far as possible, so that

1524
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.151
home as far as possible, so that
actually you don’t have high

1525
00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:19.110
actually you don’t have high
densities of people crowded into

1526
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.318
densities of people crowded into
those office environments using

1527
00:54:21.318 --> 00:54:22.943
those office environments using
shared equipment. My issue here, I

1528
00:54:22.943 --> 00:54:25.360
shared equipment. My issue here, I
feel we need a bit of reality. There

1529
00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.318
feel we need a bit of reality. There
will be lots of responsible

1530
00:54:26.318 --> 00:54:27.860
will be lots of responsible
employers. There already are, doing

1531
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.693
employers. There already are, doing
the kinds of thinking you’re doing,

1532
00:54:29.693 --> 00:54:31.610
the kinds of thinking you’re doing,
taking the right steps and really

1533
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:32.526
taking the right steps and really
investing and caring about

1534
00:54:32.526 --> 00:54:34.360
investing and caring about
protecting their workforce, but

1535
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.610
protecting their workforce, but
there will always be employers who

1536
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.026
there will always be employers who
are not responsible and willing to

1537
00:54:37.026 --> 00:54:38.485
are not responsible and willing to
put their workers at risk, and these

1538
00:54:38.485 --> 00:54:39.610
put their workers at risk, and these
conversations are designed to

1539
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.026
conversations are designed to
protect people who work for the

1540
00:54:41.026 --> 00:54:41.193
protect peopla who work for the
worst

1541
00:54:41.193 --> 00:54:42.985
protect people who work for the
worst case scenario business and

1542
00:54:42.985 --> 00:54:43.568
worst rase scenario business and
that’s why we

1543
00:54:43.568 --> 00:54:44.110
worst case scenario business and
that’s why we need stringent

1544
00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:46.360
that’s why we need stringent
measures that are not optional

1545
00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.735
measures that are not optional
because otherwise people who are

1546
00:54:47.735 --> 00:54:48.985
because otherwise people who are
vulnerable who are too insecure to

1547
00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:51.193
vulnerable who are too insecure to
be able to challenge safety at work

1548
00:54:51.193 --> 00:54:53.443
be able to challenge safety at work
or too dependent on zero hours or

1549
00:54:53.443 --> 00:54:55.193
or too dependent on zero hours or
other insecure contracts to opt out

1550
00:54:55.193 --> 00:54:56.651
other insecure contracts to opt out
of working won’t be protected. 50 we

1551
00:54:56.651 --> 00:54:57.276
of working won’t be protected. So we
have to be

1552
00:54:57.276 --> 00:54:57.860
of working won’t be protected. 50 we
have to be thinking about the

1553
00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:57.985
of working won’t be protected. So we
have to be thinking about the worst

1554
00:54:57.985 --> 00:54:59.985
have to be thinking about the worst
case scenario, not the best case

1555
00:54:59.985 --> 00:55:02.776
rase scenario, not the best rase
scenario.

1556
00:55:02.776 --> 00:55:05.485
case scenario, not the best case
scenario. What are your thoughts?

1557
00:55:05.485 --> 00:55:05.860
scenario. what are your thoughts?
That is

1558
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.735
scenario. What are your thoughts?
That is not Eric’s parents, dealing

1559
00:55:06.735 --> 00:55:07.860
That is not Eric’s parents, dealing
with the business. There are large

1560
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.901
with the business. There are large
companies and small companies do

1561
00:55:08.901 --> 00:55:11.735
companies and small companies do
everybody takes this very seriously.

1562
00:55:11.735 --> 00:55:13.901
everybody takes this very seriously.
-- that is

1563
00:55:13.901 --> 00:55:17.276
everybody takes this very seriously.
—— that is not our experience.

1564
00:55:17.276 --> 00:55:17.443
-- that is not our experience.
Employers

1565
00:55:17.443 --> 00:55:18.026
—— that is not our experience.
Employers their employees very

1566
00:55:18.026 --> 00:55:20.318
Employers their employees very
fiercely. The reason the Health and

1567
00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:21.526
fiercely. The reason the Health and
Safety Executive exist is because

1568
00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:23.068
Safety Executive exist is because
there are people that don’t take it

1569
00:55:23.068 --> 00:55:25.276
there are people that don’t take it
easily. Are you suggesting they all

1570
00:55:25.276 --> 00:55:27.943
easily. Are you suggesting they all
miraculously well now? The Health

1571
00:55:27.943 --> 00:55:30.276
miraculously well now? The Health
and Safety Executive have been

1572
00:55:30.276 --> 00:55:32.693
and Safety Executive have been
involved in guidance with food

1573
00:55:32.693 --> 00:55:34.401
involved in guidance with food
companies, as has Public Health

1574
00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:35.485
companies, as has Public Health
England, and the Food Standards

1575
00:55:35.485 --> 00:55:37.068
England, and the Food Standards
Agency as well. All of those

1576
00:55:37.068 --> 00:55:38.860
Agency as well. All of those
agencies have been working and

1577
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.901
agencies have been working and
contributing to the guidance

1578
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:41.151
contributing to the guidance
businesses are following. Like Mike

1579
00:55:41.151 --> 00:55:46.985
businesses are following. Like Mike

an existing

1583
00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.401
Juergen. The point, Fiona, there is
an existing process. Every director

00:55:51.401 --> 00:55:54.235
an existing process. Every director
of an

1585
00:55:54.235 --> 00:55:56.985

of an Of a company, they know
their responsibility in keeping

their responsibility in keeping
their employees say. That is crystal

1588
00:55:59.693 --> 00:56:02.110
their employees say. That is crystal
clear and you have to do that at any

1589
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.860
clear and you have to do that at any
time. We are now adding living and

1590
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.276
time. We are now adding living and
working with Covid as a requirement

1591
00:56:06.276 --> 00:56:08.860
working with Covid as a requirement
to keep safe. We get some guidelines

1592
00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.526
to keep safe. We get some guidelines
around that. I totally agree with

1593
00:56:11.526 --> 00:56:13.860
around that. I totally agree with
Afua, most employers will do that

1594
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.193
Afua, most employers will do that
because they take it seriously, and

1595
00:56:15.193 --> 00:56:16.735
because they take it seriously, and
quite frankly they don’t they

1596
00:56:16.735 --> 00:56:17.860
quite frankly they don’t they
shouldn’t be in business, safety

1597
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.526
shouldn’t be in business, safety
comes number one. And the Health and

1598
00:56:20.526 --> 00:56:21.610
comes number one. And the Health and
Safety Executive will enforce the

1599
00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:24.776
Safety Executive will enforce the
few that don’t come and it is a few.

1600
00:56:24.776 --> 00:56:26.901
few that don’t come and it is a few.
In addition to many, in my

1601
00:56:26.901 --> 00:56:28.235
In addition to many, in my
experience. George, from where you

1602
00:56:28.235 --> 00:56:30.735
experience. George, from where you
are sitting in Government, do you

1603
00:56:30.735 --> 00:56:32.276
are sitting in Government, do you
think it’s going to be difficult to

1604
00:56:32.276 --> 00:56:33.193
think it’s going to be difficult to
get peopla

1605
00:56:33.193 --> 00:56:33.985
think it’s going to be difficult to
get people back to work? Obviously

1606
00:56:33.985 --> 00:56:34.485
get peopla back to work? Obviously
peopla are

1607
00:56:34.485 --> 00:56:35.110
get people back to work? Obviously
people are desperate to start

1608
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:36.485
people are desperate to start
earning again and all of that, but

1609
00:56:36.485 --> 00:56:39.443
earning again and all of that, but
they are anxious as well. There will

1610
00:56:39.443 --> 00:56:40.610
they are anxious as well. There will
be some apprehension, of course, and

1611
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:42.485
be some apprehension, of course, and
that’s why we have been working on

1612
00:56:42.485 --> 00:56:44.526
that’s why we have been working on
this guidance. Coming back to my

1613
00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:45.901
this guidance. Coming back to my
experience in the sector where they

1614
00:56:45.901 --> 00:56:47.568
experience in the sector where they
had high absentee levels of about

1615
00:56:47.568 --> 00:56:49.735
had high absentee levels of about
20% at the beginning, and it is

1616
00:56:49.735 --> 00:56:50.026
2096 at the beginning, and it is
right now

1617
00:56:50.026 --> 00:56:52.026
20% at the beginning, and it is
right now down to about four or 5%,

1618
00:56:52.026 --> 00:56:52.568
right now down to about four or 596,
which isn’t

1619
00:56:52.568 --> 00:56:53.860
right now down to about four or 5%,
which isn’t much different to

1620
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.276
which isn’t much different to
normal, so what people discovered is

1621
00:56:56.276 --> 00:56:57.360
normal, so what people discovered is
once those social distancing

1622
00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.860
once those social distancing
measures were put in place staff

1623
00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.776
measures were put in place staff
returned to work, some of them

1624
00:57:00.776 --> 00:57:02.318
returned to work, some of them
returned from being in isolation,

1625
00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:03.610
returned from being in isolation,
some of them return because perhaps

1626
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:05.610
some of them return because perhaps
they were anxious but had learned

1627
00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:06.776
they were anxious but had learned
that actually these measures had

1628
00:57:06.776 --> 00:57:09.318
that actually these measures had
been put in place that reassure

1629
00:57:09.318 --> 00:57:11.651
been put in place that reassure
them. But we will all have different

1630
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:13.026
them. But we will all have different
complications, won’t we? We work in

1631
00:57:13.026 --> 00:57:14.651
complications, won’t we? We work in
the centre of London and when we

1632
00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:16.193
the centre of London and when we
have been talking to our staff about

1633
00:57:16.193 --> 00:57:17.651
have been talking to our staff about
beginning to think about what might

1634
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:19.276
beginning to think about what might
happen, quite rightly, one of the

1635
00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:20.693
happen, quite rightly, one of the
things they immediately raise,

1636
00:57:20.693 --> 00:57:22.610
things they immediately raise,
what’s it going to be like

1637
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.901
what’s it going to be like
travelling to work into central

1638
00:57:24.901 --> 00:57:26.776
travelling to work into central
London and actually being on a

1639
00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:29.110
London and actually being on a
packed Tube train next to people who

1640
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:30.943
packed Tube train next to people who
might present a safety risk? I think

1641
00:57:30.943 --> 00:57:33.110
might present a safety risk? I think
one of the issues the Government

1642
00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.610
one of the issues the Government
faces is this is quite multifaceted,

1643
00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.276
faces is this is quite multifaceted,
it’s not... George talks about the

1644
00:57:37.276 --> 00:57:38.318
it’s not... George talks about the
food industry because he is

1645
00:57:38.318 --> 00:57:40.110
food industry because he is
responsible for that but we also

1646
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:41.526
responsible for that but we also
need to ensure transport is

1647
00:57:41.526 --> 00:57:43.235
need to ensure transport is
appropriately configured, so this is

1648
00:57:43.235 --> 00:57:44.776
appropriately configured, so this is
quite a complex picture if we are

1649
00:57:44.776 --> 00:57:46.776
quite a complex picture if we are
actually going to be able to

1650
00:57:46.776 --> 00:57:47.818
actually going to be able to
encourage people, and enable and

1651
00:57:47.818 --> 00:57:47.901
encourage peopla, and enabla and
support

1652
00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:49.860
encourage people, and enable and
support them, to come back to work.

1653
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.193
support them, to come back to work.
We have the example of other

1654
00:57:51.193 --> 00:57:53.068
We have the example of other
countries ahead of first night we

1655
00:57:53.068 --> 00:57:53.318

1697
00:59:25.193 --> 00:59:26.901
So...

1698
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:28.818
I hear you’ve been very naughty.

1699
00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.860
Have I?

1700
00:59:35.526 --> 00:59:37.776
When faced with
time on your hands...

1701
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:42.318
..and a magnificent model...

1702
00:59:42.318 --> 00:59:45.235
..why not pick up a pencil and draw?

1703
00:59:46.693 --> 00:59:49.276
From a sensible distance, of course.

1704
00:59:49.276 --> 00:59:52.860
Relax and be part of
a live life drawing class

1705
00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:56.568
and sketch a pose at home or online.

1706
01:00:21.193 --> 01:00:24.360
Fergus, Laura, I’d like to introduce
you to the rock royalty we’re

1707
01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.651
going to speak to later
on in this podcast.

1708
01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:27.776
What?

1709
01:00:27.776 --> 01:00:28.860
It’s Brian May!

1710
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.860
Hello, Brian.

1711
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.860
Hi, Brian.

1712
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.901
Hello, Fergus and Laura.

1713
01:00:31.901 --> 01:00:32.943
Hello!

1714
01:00:32.943 --> 01:00:33.985
How are you doing?

1715
01:00:33.985 --> 01:00:37.276
I’m doing 0K, apart from an injury
to some of my muscles

1716
01:00:37.276 --> 01:00:39.526
which I sustained in the garden.

1717
01:00:39.526 --> 01:00:40.985
Oh, no!

1718
01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:43.110
I can’t walk or sleep at the moment.

1719
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:44.151
Really?

1720
01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:45.568
Oh, no!

1721
01:00:45.568 --> 01:00:46.860
Apart from that, you’re fine(!).

1722
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.318
Apart from that, I’m great.

1723
01:00:48.318 --> 01:00:50.110
Excellent.

1724
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:51.443
Well, get well soon.

1725
01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:55.693
We’ll speak to you at length
about what you’re doing to raise

1726
01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.693
money for the World Health
Organisation.

1727
01:00:57.693 --> 01:01:01.276
I thought it was The Who —
as in the WHO, not the Who —

1728
01:01:01.276 --> 01:01:03.443
but we can clear that up in a bit.

1729
01:01:03.443 --> 01:01:04.443
We’ll clarify it.

1730
01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:06.068
Thank you forjoining us.

1731
01:01:06.068 --> 01:01:09.610
We won’t get fooled again, will we?

1732
01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.776
Let’s talk about all the day’s news
as well in this edition

1733
01:01:12.776 --> 01:01:14.985
of the Coronavirus Newscast.

1734
01:01:14.985 --> 01:01:17.443
The Coronavirus Newscast
from the BBC.

1735
01:01:22.943 --> 01:01:23.985
Hello.

1736
01:01:23.985 --> 01:01:25.276
It’s Adam in the studio.

1737
01:01:25.276 --> 01:01:27.610
And Laura in the same studio,
but two metres apart.

1738
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.860
And Fergus in another studio
in New Broadcasting House.

1739
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.985
And we’re going to bejoined
for the first part of this

1740
01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:35.901
podcast by Gavin Barwell,
Lord Barwell, who used

1741
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:38.360
to be chief of staff
to the previous Prime Minister,

1742
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.735
Theresa May.

1743
01:01:39.735 --> 01:01:40.776
Hello, Gavin.

1744
01:01:40.776 --> 01:01:41.901
Hi.

1745
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:45.526
I was going to call you Lord R—well,
seeing as we’re talking about the R

1746
01:01:45.526 --> 01:01:46.776
number all the time now.

1747
01:01:46.776 --> 01:01:47.776
No?

1748
01:01:47.776 --> 01:01:49.651
0K, never mind.

1749
01:01:49.651 --> 01:01:53.193
So the reason we brought you in,
Gavin, was to get some insight

1750
01:01:53.193 --> 01:01:56.985
into how difficult it is making big
decisions like how do you perhaps

1751
01:01:56.985 --> 01:02:00.193
tweak the social distancing rules
and how do you communicate it

1752
01:02:00.193 --> 01:02:03.818
to the public, because that’s
the sort of decisions you had

1753
01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:06.485
to make when you were in government.

1754
01:02:06.485 --> 01:02:09.401
First of all, I wanted to say,
Newscasters have been coming up

1755
01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:11.401
with potential names
for the next phase.

1756
01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:12.485
0h!

1757
01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:13.651
The unlockdown.

1758
01:02:13.651 --> 01:02:15.151
The unfurling.

1759
01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:17.360
Liftoff, or my favourite one...

1760
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.068
Quarantween.

1761
01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:20.110
Because it’s in between.

1762
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:23.193
Oh, I was thinking rollback.

1763
01:02:23.193 --> 01:02:25.818
Some people have been
talking about rollback

1764
01:02:25.818 --> 01:02:28.860
or "unwind" I’ve also heard.

1765
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:33.026
But it’s not going to be a giant
flinging open of the doors, is it?

1766
01:02:33.026 --> 01:02:36.193
We expected all week that at some
point, and now we know it

1767
01:02:36.193 --> 01:02:39.068
will be 7pm on Sunday,
we will hear from the Prime Minister

1768
01:02:39.068 --> 01:02:43.443
the gradual route out of this,
but he said yesterday some

1769
01:02:43.443 --> 01:02:46.818
of the restrictions might be
unwound as early as Monday,

1770
01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:49.360
and the government confirmed last
night the stay—at—home message,

1771
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.026
which has been so successful
in keeping people at home,

1772
01:02:52.026 --> 01:02:55.068
will be dispatched,
but today has been a bit

1773
01:02:55.068 --> 01:02:59.401
tricky for the government,
with these things all coming out.

1774
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.235
We saw Dominic Raab,
the Foreign Secretary,

1775
01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:04.068
at the Downing Street briefing
revealing his version of the slogan,

1776
01:03:04.068 --> 01:03:08.151
and it’s definitely not as exciting
or concise as quarantween.

1777
01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.860
Have a listen.

1778
01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:14.860
We had updated evidence from Sage
and there’s further evidence coming

1779
01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:18.943
through and we have to take those
decisions at the right moment

1780
01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:23.568
in time based on that evidence,
and whatever has been reported

1781
01:03:23.568 --> 01:03:27.651
in the newspapers is not a reliable
guide to either the evidence

1782
01:03:27.651 --> 01:03:30.526
we are getting or the policy
decisions we will be taking,

1783
01:03:30.526 --> 01:03:34.026
so that is why it’s very important
that the Prime Minister on Sunday

1784
01:03:34.026 --> 01:03:37.818
will set out a road map,
and I think it is safe to say that

1785
01:03:37.818 --> 01:03:42.485
any changes in the short term
will be modest, small,

1786
01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.318
incremental and very
carefully monitored and,

1787
01:03:45.318 --> 01:03:47.860
as of now, there are no changes.

1788
01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.860
Modest, small, incremental
and carefully monitored.

1789
01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.776
That’s catchy.

1790
01:03:51.776 --> 01:03:54.151
Really tricky, because
the government was facing

1791
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:56.818
lots of demands from its critics,
saying, you’ve got to tell

1792
01:03:56.818 --> 01:03:59.151
us what the plan is,
you’ve got to give us

1793
01:03:59.151 --> 01:04:00.193
an exit strategy.

1794
01:04:00.193 --> 01:04:03.360
Now they’re tiptoeing towards one,
but at the same time there’s a huge

1795
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.026
risk of mixing the message.

1796
01:04:05.026 --> 01:04:06.818
Really difficult.

1797
01:04:06.818 --> 01:04:09.651
Gavin, as somebody who has pulled
the levers of government,

1798
01:04:09.651 --> 01:04:13.693
how hard is this balancing act
and this salesjob

1799
01:04:13.693 --> 01:04:15.485
and communication job?

1800
01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.110
I think this is harder
than anything I had to deal

1801
01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:19.568
with for a number of reasons...

1802
01:04:19.568 --> 01:04:20.651
Brexit?

1803
01:04:20.651 --> 01:04:25.693
Yeah, this is a much more
difficult issue than Brexit.

1804
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.943
I have every sympathy for the people
at Number Ten at the moment.

1805
01:04:28.943 --> 01:04:33.193
The first thing is that there isn’t
a scientific consensus.

1806
01:04:33.193 --> 01:04:36.026
This is a new virus,
so the scientists are not

1807
01:04:36.026 --> 01:04:39.985
all agreed, so when you say,
I’m following the scientific advice,

1808
01:04:39.985 --> 01:04:41.026
well, whose advice?

1809
01:04:41.026 --> 01:04:45.318
And the second issue is we know this
crisis will lead to people dying

1810
01:04:45.318 --> 01:04:48.568
in three different ways —
some people from the virus,

1811
01:04:48.568 --> 01:04:52.443
some because they didn’t seek
medical attention during the crisis,

1812
01:04:52.443 --> 01:04:55.276
and that will affect them
going forward, and some people

1813
01:04:55.276 --> 01:04:57.901
because of the increased deprivation
that will come from the economic

1814
01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:01.735
consequences, and the people that
listen this are getting one figure

1815
01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:04.860
every night and the other two
we can’t see at the moment,

1816
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.110
so how do you strike that balance?

1817
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.318
I think Laura was talking
about the potential communications

1818
01:05:11.318 --> 01:05:15.401
challenge, because they’ll want
people to resume some sort
