temperature we’ve seen so far in the
UK this autumn and winter season and

are going to see some snow across
the high ground of northern England

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:26.012
the high ground of northern England
and even for a time across quite low

00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:27.762
and even for a time across quite low
levels in Scotland. Over some of the

18
00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.720
levels in Scotland. Over some of the
mountains in Scotland we could be

19
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.595
mountains in Scotland we could be
looking at 10—20 centimetres of

20
00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:32.012
looking at 10-20 centimetres of
snow.

21
00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:33.845
looking at 10—20 centimetres of
snow. Some showers for Wales and the

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:34.095
snow. Some showers for Walas and the
south-west,

23
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:35.387
snow. Some showers for Wales and the
south—west, these could be wintry

24
00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:35.970
south-west, these could be wintry
over high

25
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.220
south—west, these could be wintry
over high ground and this band of

26
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.470
over high ground and this band of
rain across eastern England could

27
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.179
rain across eastern England could
contain Sneyd —— sleet and wet snow.

28
00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:43.387
contain Sneyd -- sleet and wet snow.
Tomorrow

29
00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:44.387
contain Sneyd —— sleet and wet snow.
Tomorrow most of the snow becomes

30
00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:45.804
Tomorrow most of the snow becomes
confined to high ground with rain at

31
00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:47.054
confined to high ground with rain at
lower levels. Brighter towards the

32
00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:49.137
lower levels. Brighter towards the
south. These are the wind gusts,

33
00:00:49.137 --> 00:00:51.179
south. These are the wind gusts,
they could be 50 miles an hour or

34
00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:51.554
they could be 50 mils an hour or
more for

35
00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:53.179
they could be 50 miles an hour or
more for western coasts, so with the

36
00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.095
more for western coasts, so with the
rain, sleet and snow and winds, it’s

37
00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.054
rain, sleet and snow and winds, it’s
going to feel cold, 4—7 C. Through

38
00:00:59.054 --> 00:00:59.304
going to feel cold, 4-7 C. Through
the

39
00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:00.845
going to feel cold, 4—7 C. Through
the weekend things will calm down.

40
00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.220
the weekend things will calm down.
It will slowly but surely turn

41
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.970
It will slowly but surely turn
drier, but it will remain cold.

42
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.387

Welcome to The Wheel!

It’s already got us in a spin,

46
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.554
and there’s lots more to come.

47
00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.720
The Tudors was in the 16005, right?

48
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.679
Pfft! And I’ve got 3 GCSE!

49
00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.054
I’m not sensing the most
amount of confidence there.

This isn’t a mere invention,

this is the substance of dreams.

It has started.

from Bath and around Bath.

93

come in the usual way,
on social media, @bbcquestiontime.

98
00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:35.054
Let’s kick off with their
first question tonight,

99
00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:36.262
which is from Colleen Bower.

100
00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:37.304
Hello there.

101
00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:39.470
Scientists and regulators have done
an amazing job getting

102
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.137
the Pfizer vaccine developed,
approved and off

103
00:04:41.137 --> 00:04:42.179
the starting blocks.

104
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:45.304
Will they and the public now be let
down at the final hurdle

105
00:04:45.304 --> 00:04:46.345
by our logistics capabilities?

106
00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:49.179
Sarah?

107
00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:51.845
Well, it’s a good question,
and I think that’s the question

108
00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:56.137
everyone is asking at the moment.

109
00:04:56.137 --> 00:04:58.095
It’s fantastic news that
we’ve got the vaccine,

110
00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:01.387
and it really is a moment to be
proud, to be proud of all

111
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:04.262
the scientists across the world that
are working on all these vaccines,

112
00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.929
and to have that light
at the end of the tunnel.

113
00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:08.595
When you’re putting up your
Christmas decorations,

114
00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:10.845
you can think, "There will be an end
to this," because there

115
00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:11.470
you can think, "There will be an end
to this," because there

116
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.554
is a vaccine coming.

117
00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:13.554
It’s brilliant.

118
00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:13.929
But we know, and the scientists
have been really clear,

119
00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.637
But we know, and the scientists
have been really clear,

120
00:05:16.637 --> 00:05:18.970
in the press conference
with the Prime Minister yesterday

121
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.970
in the press conference
with the Prime Minister yesterday

122
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.845
and all through the day to day,
this is going to be

123
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:25.970
very challenging logistically.

124
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.887
Firstly, how is it
going to be delivered,

125
00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:28.929
and to whom?

126
00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:33.929
Of course there are tears of people
that are going to get it first.

127
00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:40.220
—— Of course there are
tiers of people that

128
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.762
are going to get it first.

129
00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:47.887
But I don’t know about you,
but my MP WhatsApp groups have been

130
00:05:47.887 --> 00:05:50.262
buzzing all day with people saying,
"Well, we’ve heard there’s

131
00:05:50.262 --> 00:05:53.345
going to be a hospital here doing it
and a hospital they are,

132
00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:54.595
but what about our area?"

133
00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:55.804
Everyone is worrying about that.

134
00:05:55.804 --> 00:05:57.970
We worry about care
homes, of course we do,

135
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.137
because we know that,
you know, there are logistical

136
00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:02.762
issues with this particular vaccine
in terms of the temperature it

137
00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:03.804
needs to be.

138
00:06:03.804 --> 00:06:07.179
Are we going to make sure we can get
to those care homes properly?

139
00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.012
And then I think there is also
a challenge with public health

140
00:06:10.012 --> 00:06:12.679
and making sure people know
that they can trust this vaccine

141
00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:14.179
and that they should use it.

142
00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:16.512
You know, we’re not measles—free
in this country any more.

143
00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:17.554
We were.

144
00:06:17.554 --> 00:06:19.970
We’re not any more, because people
haven’t trusted the vaccine,

145
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.137
so we need a really good
public health message.

146
00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:24.720
But I think, you know,
this is a really big challenge.

147
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.637
The Government haven’t got it right
on things like test and trace.

148
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:30.512
They have to get it right now,
because there are people’s lives

149
00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:32.512
on the line, and we can’t
get this wrong again.

150
00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:32.970
on the line, and we can’t
get this wrong again.

151
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.970
Liam?

152
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.595
Well, vaccines of course mark
a major advance in human achievement

153
00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:38.179
since the Enlightenment,
into the 19th century,

154
00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.262
since the Enlightenment,
into the 19th century,

155
00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:39.345
and Britain’s been at the forefront
of those achievements over

156
00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:40.679
and Britain’s been at the forefront
of those achievements over

157
00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:43.137
the years and decades.

158
00:06:43.137 --> 00:06:45.054
But this isn’t the time
for vaccine nationalism,

159
00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.429
and I agree we should congratulate
the scientists, the Pfizer

160
00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:48.887
scientists in Belgium,
the Moderna scientists

161
00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:50.804
in the States, you know,
British scientists working

162
00:06:50.804 --> 00:06:52.970
in international teams
here in the UK with AstraZeneca.

163
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.387
But what about the
logistical capabilities?

164
00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:56.304
That’s what Colleen
was asking about.

165
00:06:56.304 --> 00:07:01.304
The logistical capabilities
are obviously forefront now,

166
00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:04.970
now we’ve got a vaccine that’s been
approved, and I am reassured

167
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.137
that the British Army
are going to be involved.

168
00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:12.179
Their absolute world expert clinic
at rolling out things,

169
00:07:16.887 --> 00:07:21.845
—— They’re absolute world experts
at rolling out things,

170
00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:26.845
complex capabilities.

171
00:07:26.845 --> 00:07:29.220
This is probably going to be
the biggest logistical exercise

172
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.637
that our Armed Forces have
undertaken since the Falklands War,

173
00:07:31.637 --> 00:07:33.554
which I’m old enough
to remember, just about.

174
00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:34.595
So let’s hope so.

175
00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:37.970
As a neutral, I’d like to see a lot
of cross—party cooperation, and I’m

176
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.179
encouraged with Sarah’s tone there.

177
00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.512
I think everybody wants to see us
alljust getting on with this now.

178
00:07:42.512 --> 00:07:44.970
We don’t want to see, you know,
competition between countries

179
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.137
on whose vaccine is best.

180
00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:48.762
There will be some instances where
the Pfizer vaccine works better.

181
00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:51.179
There will be other instances,
for instance, where you can’t

182
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.137
have a very, very cold
refrigeration, and maybe

183
00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:55.262
across the developing world as well,
a cheaper vaccine

184
00:07:55.262 --> 00:07:56.970
like the AstraZeneca Oxford
vaccine works better.

185
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.554
Let’s just keep our fingers crossed
and hope that we make

186
00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:00.762
a good job of this.

187
00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:01.970
Colleen, you ask the question.

188
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.387
What prompted you to ask this?

189
00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:05.804
Is this because you’ve got concerns,
or what’s behind it?

190
00:08:05.804 --> 00:08:08.679
Well, we haven’t really covered
ourselves in glory so far at any

191
00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:09.762
logistical exercise.

192
00:08:09.762 --> 00:08:12.595
I mean, with the PPE,
test and trace, any of the things

193
00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:15.012
that have had to be done
to do with Covid.

194
00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:17.929
So, yes, I have got concerns,
and I also think that maybe

195
00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:19.595
the Government should be
managing expectations better.

196
00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:22.179
They seem to come out and say,
"Everything’s going to be

197
00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.220
done by springtime."

198
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.262
I think that’s highly
unlikely, given the record.

199
00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:32.970
And I don’t know that a lot has been
gained by suggesting that.

200
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.262
It’ll be great if the military
is involved, and I think it would be

201
00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:38.679
much better if the military
was involved in the command

202
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.554
and control, rather thanjust
the delivery side, and I hope that

203
00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:44.262
that will maybe he the case.

204
00:08:44.262 --> 00:08:49.012
50, Michelle, are we going to be let
down by logistics capabilities?

205
00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:51.845
No, I think, to Colleen’s point,
I can totally understand why people

206
00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:54.512
are concerned and nervous at this
stage, because we’ve got this

207
00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:58.845
far and it’s good news.

208
00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:01.929
But we’ve made it very clear
as a Government this is a massive

209
00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:03.345
logistical challenge,
but one that our

210
00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:04.595
massive NHS is up to.

211
00:09:04.595 --> 00:09:08.220
This is the same NHS that’s got us
through this pandemic,

212
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.179
the fantastic people,
including in my own constituency,

213
00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:15.054
that work tirelessly to support us.

214
00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:18.679
We have a plan, we’re going to do
this, we’re going to do it together,

215
00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.804
but this isn’t going to happen
overnight and we need to be very

216
00:09:21.804 --> 00:09:22.845
realistic about that.

217
00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.220
To be successful, we need to green
light other vaccinations.

218
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.679
This is just the first one.

219
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.845
It also depends on the manufacturer
of these vaccinations,

220
00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:31.679
which to an extent is slightly out
of our control as well.

221
00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.845
So this is going to
be a long process.

222
00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:37.429
And hope and help is here, but we’ve
certainly got a long way to go.

223
00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:39.387
Can I just ask you,
because the Government

224
00:09:39.387 --> 00:09:42.220
and Jonathan Van—Tam have been
saying today the aim is to get

225
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.929
it to care homes first,
but there are difficulties with this

226
00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:47.679
particular Pfizer vaccine because it
has to be stored at such

227
00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:50.762
an incredibly cold temperature,
so it’s not going to get to care

228
00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:53.179
homes first, but in Scotland
the Scottish Health Secretary says

229
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:56.095
care homes will have the vaccine
taken to them from the 14th

230
00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.929
of December, so what is it that
they’re able to do that

231
00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:03.970
we’re not able to do?

232
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:09.762
So, from my understanding,
it’s also that you can’t break up

233
00:10:09.762 --> 00:10:10.929
the number of vaccines together...

234
00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:13.595
No, no, why are they able...
So it is also about...

235
00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:16.929
Why are they able to do it
and we’re not able to do it?

236
00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:19.845
It’s also about breaking them up
and that needs the MHRA approval

237
00:10:19.845 --> 00:10:22.470
to be able to do that so you’re
not wasting vaccines.

238
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.929
So if you were taking 600...

239
00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:26.304
Yes, but that’s true
for the Scottish Government as well.

240
00:10:26.304 --> 00:10:29.929
So is it that what they are saying
is not right, or can they do

241
00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.095
something that we can’t do?

242
00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.012
I think that that approval
is potentially forthcoming,

243
00:10:33.012 --> 00:10:34.054
so that might...

244
00:10:34.054 --> 00:10:35.720
I can’t speak to the exact comment.

245
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.387
It may be that they are banking
on that approval coming.

246
00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:40.554
We’ve said throughout,
for a number of weeks now,

247
00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:43.387
that our priority is care homes
and making sure we get that

248
00:10:43.387 --> 00:10:45.137
vaccination in there
as quickly as possible.

249
00:10:45.137 --> 00:10:48.970
We’ve got to do that and we will be
doing it as soon as we can.

250
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.345
Peter, in terms of the logistics
capabilities — it’s obviously

251
00:10:51.345 --> 00:10:53.470
a fantastic breakthrough
to have a vaccine, let alone

252
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.387
a number of vaccines,
coming down the pipeline.

253
00:10:55.387 --> 00:10:57.804
In terms of getting it out
to people, how confident

254
00:10:57.804 --> 00:10:58.887
are you about that?

255
00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:01.804
Yeah, so this is clearly
a tremendous triumph of science

256
00:11:01.804 --> 00:11:03.679
that
we’ve managed to get this far.

257
00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:06.262
I think we are up to the logistic
challenge, and that’s

258
00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:09.429
because we have a superb system
in the NHS that can deliver vaccines

259
00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:12.095
at scale, and we have tremendous
networks which are already present

260
00:11:12.095 --> 00:11:14.179
throughout the country.

261
00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:17.554
I don’t think we need to put
in a whole new command and control

262
00:11:17.554 --> 00:11:20.387
system in order to do this
because we do have the people

263
00:11:20.387 --> 00:11:25.304
already up for this
particular challenge.

264
00:11:25.304 --> 00:11:27.970
I mean, I think the problem
about breaking up the batches

265
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.470
and getting them out into care homes
is a very important one.

266
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.512
We know that the best way to deliver
vaccines is at the point

267
00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:38.220
where people are actually assembled
in workplaces, schools and so on.

268
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.012
We always know that that’s
the best way to do it.

269
00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:46.012
So I think we must find ways
of getting round the logistical

270
00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:51.554
problems which are because of having
only four stages that you’re

271
00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:54.387
allowed, by the regulations,
to stage this vaccine as it comes

272
00:11:54.387 --> 00:11:56.095
from the factory into
the delivery points.

273
00:11:56.095 --> 00:11:57.512
But I think that is surmountable.

274
00:11:57.512 --> 00:12:01.179
Itjust needs a little bit of work.

275
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.887
Tom?

276
00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:07.554
From my point of view,
I mean it’s been a magical

277
00:12:07.554 --> 00:12:11.054
couple of days, you know,
the news that’s coming through,

278
00:12:11.054 --> 00:12:13.887
it feels that there is an end
to this nightmare that we’ve

279
00:12:13.887 --> 00:12:17.387
all been living, feeling that...

280
00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:19.554
However, you know, the short term
excitement about it,

281
00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:21.970
long term there are those problems
of getting everybody vaccinated

282
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.804
to make sure that we can
get our lives back to normal

283
00:12:24.804 --> 00:12:28.387
and running in that space.

284
00:12:28.387 --> 00:12:31.470
I mean, yes, we have a poor
track record of how

285
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.512
we’ve dealt with coronavirus,
I have to be honest.

286
00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:39.179
As you sit there and somebody
from the outside, within industry,

287
00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:42.220
and you look at the way that...

288
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.637
I mean, how the whole thing
has been dealt with.

289
00:12:44.637 --> 00:12:46.554
You look at the track
and trace system.

290
00:12:46.554 --> 00:12:48.470
It is something that we
have struggled with.

291
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.637
I mean, there have been
bold claims about it

292
00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.554
and we are still struggling
with it now.

293
00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:55.262
So I can understand people’s worry,
Colleen’s point of view,

294
00:12:55.262 --> 00:12:58.929
"Are we going to fall into the same
trap where it comes to rolling out

295
00:12:58.929 --> 00:12:59.929
the logistics of this?"

296
00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:04.304
However, I mean, logistics,
it isn’t falling into that tech

297
00:13:04.304 --> 00:13:06.720
problem where we’re trying to get
everybody to download apps

298
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.387
and try to make the app work.

299
00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:11.512
It is much more of a case
of being connected to human beings,

300
00:13:11.512 --> 00:13:14.054
manoeuvring, getting close
to people, and resolving it.

301
00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:16.679
So, yes, I think if there
are the army brought in,

302
00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:19.304
if there are people all over this
who have an understanding

303
00:13:19.304 --> 00:13:21.970
of how logistics works,
it isn’t the same as the track

304
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.512
and trace system, so it does give us
hope that perhaps there is something

305
00:13:25.512 --> 00:13:28.179
that’s coming through the other side
that we will eventually get

306
00:13:28.179 --> 00:13:29.179
something right during this.

307
00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:31.845
There’s lots of hands up.
Let me go around our audience.

308
00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:36.845
Beth?

309
00:13:37.262 --> 00:13:40.720
It’s obviously been a really
difficult year for everyone,

310
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.637
and I think news of this vaccine
is a huge encouragement

311
00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:47.804
that the end is in sight,

312
00:13:47.804 --> 00:13:52.845
But also it’s a very specific
vaccine in that it has to be stored

313
00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:02.929
at —70 degrees C.

314
00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:06.054
It can’tjust be kept in the fridge
like most normal ones can.

315
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.179
And, looking at who is going to be
receiving it first, care homes,

316
00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.804
other facilities that perhaps aren’t
geared to catering for this type

317
00:14:11.804 --> 00:14:13.970
of refrigeration, that could be
an additional logistical challenge.

318
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.137
But I think, noticing
the fact that we’ve managed

319
00:14:16.137 --> 00:14:18.429
to produce this vaccine,
scientists and researchers

320
00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:20.179
produced vaccine within a matter
of months,

321
00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:23.012
it’s actually a the remarkable feat,
and I think the logistical side

322
00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:25.137
of it will be relatively easy
compared to developing

323
00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:26.554
the vaccine in the first place.

324
00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:27.595
Patrick?

325
00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:29.512
This side of Christmas,
I think the logistics

326
00:14:29.512 --> 00:14:34.554
of delivery might well go
very well, hopefully.

327
00:14:35.387 --> 00:14:39.179
But, given that the majority
of the vaccines have

328
00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:41.137
to come from overseas,
there’s an unfortunate bit

329
00:14:41.137 --> 00:14:43.470
of timing that’s going to occur
on December the 31st,

330
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.345
and that’s Brexit of course,
and I wonder whether we can expect

331
00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:48.054
some delay on deliveries
after that date.

332
00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.095
Lawrence?

333
00:14:49.095 --> 00:14:50.762
Yes.

334
00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:53.429
No doubt, it’s absolutely
brilliant news, but this

335
00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:56.137
is an international problem,
and Bath is very much a tourism

336
00:14:56.137 --> 00:15:01.095
city, so I’d like to know
what the follow—up to this is.

337
00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:04.054
As we start becoming
vaccinated and the rest

338
00:15:04.054 --> 00:15:06.720
of the world becomes vaccinated,
is there some sort of passport

339
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.679
system that will be introduced,
so that we can start travelling

340
00:15:12.262 --> 00:15:14.970
abroad and tourists can start
travelling back into the UK that

341
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.637
have been vaccinated?

342
00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:19.887
Michelle, let me ask you about that,
and first of all the question

343
00:15:19.887 --> 00:15:23.679
from Patrick about is Brexit
going to stop, or slow down,

344
00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.595
the import of the vaccine
into this country.

345
00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:27.762
And then there is talk
about an immunity passport,

346
00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:29.679
which was hinted at by
the Vaccines Minister,

347
00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.804
Nadhim Zahawi, and then seemed to be
dismissed by Michael Gove.

348
00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:36.929
So what we’ve said as a government
on this, we’ve not got plans

349
00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:40.137
to introduce a passport or anything
like that, of that nature.

350
00:15:40.137 --> 00:15:44.220
Of course businesses may look
to do that in the future,

351
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.262
but the key thing here needs to be
promoting the vaccine and getting

352
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:53.720
the rest of those vaccines green [it
so that we can start the roll—out

353
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.262
properly and effectively.

354
00:15:56.262 --> 00:15:58.887
And are you concerned that
after December the 31st we might

355
00:15:58.887 --> 00:16:01.804
have an issue getting vaccines
across as speedily as we might like?

356
00:16:01.804 --> 00:16:05.179
So the negotiations are going on,
we know that, and they are going up

357
00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:08.470
to the wire, and we all appreciate
that, but they are still going on,

358
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.720
and we’ve done endless preparations?

359
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720
Every eventuality.

360
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.179
705 million into our borders, etc.

361
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:14.345
So we are prepared, should
that happen, either way.

362
00:16:14.345 --> 00:16:16.262
Peter, have you got any
concerns about that,

363
00:16:16.262 --> 00:16:17.970
in terms of vaccines,
medicines, coming across,

364
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.429
but vaccines in particular,
after December the 31st?

365
00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:23.095
Is that something you’ve
discussed as scientists?

366
00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:25.595
Yeah, I desperately hope not.

367
00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:29.054
I mean, it would be
an absolute disaster if Brexit

368
00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:31.304
were to cause problems
with transport of medicines.

369
00:16:31.304 --> 00:16:34.387
Other medicines as well as vaccines.

370
00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:37.595
I think it highlights an issue that
we’ve all been concerned

371
00:16:37.595 --> 00:16:40.429
about in the medical arena,
that a lot of our medicines do

372
00:16:40.429 --> 00:16:43.387
actually come from overseas,
and we need to make absolutely sure

373
00:16:43.387 --> 00:16:47.720
that the supply is going to be
uninterrupted, and we have often

374
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.804
quite short supply chains and not
very large stocks of a lot

375
00:16:51.804 --> 00:16:56.054
of medications, and I think this
really illustrates that problem.

376
00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:58.929
But I hope it will be overcome.

377
00:16:58.929 --> 00:17:02.220
It’s really a political problem
rather than a scientific one.

378
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.179
Well, since we’ve mentioned
the Brexit word and there was a time

379
00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:07.304
when this programme,
believe you me, when we mentioned

380
00:17:07.304 --> 00:17:11.470
nothing but, let’s take a question
from Catherine Hodges...

381
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.179
Has our departure from
the European Union actually helped

382
00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:17.970
in speeding up the process
to approve the vaccine?

383
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.387
DOG BARKS.

384
00:17:20.387 --> 00:17:22.304
Look, even Catherine’s
dog isjoining in the

385
00:17:22.304 --> 00:17:24.470
question, as we can hear!

386
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.012
Michelle, just clarify
where we stand with this,

387
00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:29.929
because we’ve had a number of things
about this from various people

388
00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:30.970
in the Government today.

389
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.554
Yeah, look, this is a global
pandemic, it’s been a global

390
00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:34.929
response, and, including on this...

391
00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:37.595
But has leaving the European Union
sped it up, as Matthew

392
00:17:37.595 --> 00:17:39.637
Hancock has suggested 7

393
00:17:39.637 --> 00:17:42.179
So, basically, we have our own
independent regulator.

394
00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:44.679
They have approved this.

395
00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:47.720
The European Union together have
decided to collectively

396
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720
back their regulator.

397
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.554
It wasn’t against European rules
for them to have deviated,

398
00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:54.179
each independent state.

399
00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:56.179
They chose not to do that.

400
00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:58.345
But the important
thing here is that...

401
00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:00.345
No, but the important
thing is the question.

402
00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:03.387
The question is has leaving
the European Union helped

403
00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:05.595
in speeding up the process
to approve the vaccine?

404
00:18:05.595 --> 00:18:08.429
The Health Secretary said,
"We all do the same safety checks" —

405
00:18:08.429 --> 00:18:09.679
he’s talking about the Europeans.

406
00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:12.804
"But we’ve been able to speed up how
they’re done because of Brexit."

407
00:18:12.804 --> 00:18:14.304
Is that right?

408
00:18:14.304 --> 00:18:18.512
So, as I’ve said, the Europeans have
collectively utilised one regulator,

409
00:18:18.512 --> 00:18:22.054
and we have our own regulator,
and they’ve adopted

410
00:18:22.054 --> 00:18:23.887
different processes here.

411
00:18:23.887 --> 00:18:26.054
So what they’ve done,
we have given them rolling

412
00:18:26.054 --> 00:18:28.304
results throughout...

413
00:18:28.304 --> 00:18:31.012
Yes, but have we been able
to do it more quickly?

414
00:18:31.012 --> 00:18:33.637
Yes, we’ve been able to do it more
quickly because they’ve

415
00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:36.429
accessed rolling results,
they’ve tested it sequentially,

416
00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:39.512
and that has speeded up the process,
but it hasn’t cut corners around

417
00:18:39.512 --> 00:18:42.679
the safety, and that is why we can
be confident that this vaccine

418
00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:45.470
will work, it will be effective,
and it won’t have those

419
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.179
side—effects you might
worry about, thinking,

420
00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:49.720
"Golly, this has been
done so quickly."

421
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.262
Are you concerned that
because Matthew Hancock said that,

422
00:18:53.262 --> 00:18:57.345
and we’ve also had Gavin Williamson,
the Education Secretary of course,

423
00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.720
saying, "We’ve got the very best
people in this country,

424
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.387
we’ve obviously got the best medical
regulators, better than the French,

425
00:19:02.387 --> 00:19:04.595
better than the Belgians,
we’re a much better country

426
00:19:04.595 --> 00:19:07.512
than every single one of them,
including the US", you’ve now got

427
00:19:07.512 --> 00:19:09.429
the most senior medical
officer in the States,

428
00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:14.470
Anthony Fauci, responding,
saying, "The UK took the data

429
00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:20.970
from Pfizer and instead
of scrutinising it carefully,

430
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.095
they said, OK, let’s approve it,
and that’s it", and you also had

431
00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:25.512
the EU kicking back as well.

432
00:19:25.512 --> 00:19:28.387
So, as Peter will tell you,
this is approved by an independent

433
00:19:28.387 --> 00:19:31.054
regulator that is world renowned,
so we should all have faith

434
00:19:31.054 --> 00:19:32.095
in this vaccination.

435
00:19:32.095 --> 00:19:34.970
I don’t think we should be afraid
of talking up our country

436
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.304
and the people that work in it,
and absolutely amazing

437
00:19:37.304 --> 00:19:39.637
scientists that have worked
on the process here,

438
00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.720
the regulation, getting
it through on time.

439
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.845
It is a fantastic achievement,
but it is also a worldwide

440
00:19:45.845 --> 00:19:49.304
achievement, and we are relying
on a catalogue of other

441
00:19:49.304 --> 00:19:52.470
vaccinations that have been
produced across the globe.

442
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.554
Peter?

443
00:19:54.554 --> 00:19:57.762
Yeah, I think the MHRA is one
of the most respected

444
00:19:57.762 --> 00:20:02.762
bodies internationally.

445
00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:06.720
They are extraordinarily careful
in the way in which they scrutinise

446
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.304
medicines to ensure they are not
only effective but also safe.

447
00:20:09.304 --> 00:20:14.345
And I have no concerns
at all about the way

448
00:20:15.054 --> 00:20:17.429
in which they scrutinised the data
on the Pfizer—BioNTech vaccine.

449
00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:19.887
I think it is very, very
important that medicines

450
00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:23.429
are properly regulated and,
you know, we do have a very

451
00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:24.887
proud record of it.

452
00:20:24.887 --> 00:20:28.095
I don’t think it’s really
been affected by Brexit,

453
00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:31.970
because this is an emergency
regulation which has gone

454
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.095
through all the due processes,
and I’d be very happy indeed to be

455
00:20:36.095 --> 00:20:39.345
given this vaccine tomorrow
if it was offered to me.

456
00:20:39.345 --> 00:20:42.720
So I’m just wondering what you make
of the responses that we had today

457
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.429
from the European Union,
from Anthony Fauci,

458
00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:47.095
for example, who clearly...

459
00:20:47.095 --> 00:20:52.095
Well, it suggests they feel a bit
stung by what’s been said over here.

460
00:20:57.137 --> 00:20:58.595
I think there is
unfortunate international

461
00:20:58.595 --> 00:20:59.595
competition being setup.

462
00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:01.762
You know, this is really
us against the virus,

463
00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:05.679
it’s not us against the Americans,
us against the Europeans.

464
00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:09.679
We all ought to be pulling together
and trying to do everything we can

465
00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:10.845
to defeat this virus.

466
00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:14.179
And just speaking with one voice.

467
00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:17.179
And I think it’s very unfortunate
indeed if we are actually

468
00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:19.929
trying to divide opinions
on this particular matter.

469
00:21:19.929 --> 00:21:24.054
It’s quite clear that it’s been
very, very carefully scrutinised,

470
00:21:24.054 --> 00:21:26.970
and I have no concerns about it.

471
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.804
Yeah, I mean, some of the comments,
it’s almost like, you know

472
00:21:30.804 --> 00:21:33.679
when you’re a parent
and you think your kids are the best

473
00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:36.304
kids and the cutest kids,
but you don’t go and tell

474
00:21:36.304 --> 00:21:38.720
all the other parents that
you’ve got the best kids

475
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.804
and the cutest kids.

476
00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:42.179
Itjust seems crass to say,
"Oh, we’re the best

477
00:21:42.179 --> 00:21:44.179
country in the world —
aren’t we great?

478
00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:46.304
oh, it’s because of Brexit,
which was my policy."

479
00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:49.137
That’s not the point, at all,
of what we’re doing here, and,

480
00:21:49.137 --> 00:21:52.095
you know, as it happens —
I did a lot about global,

481
00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:55.137
a lot of work about global branding,
what the world thinks of us.

482
00:21:55.137 --> 00:21:58.929
As it happens, the world has
a good view of us in terms

483
00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:01.304
of our ability to make things,
to get things done.

484
00:22:01.304 --> 00:22:03.220
If something is made
in Great Britain, people

485
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.679
will trust it round the world.

486
00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:07.095
We’re very high up in terms
of respect for what

487
00:22:07.095 --> 00:22:08.512
we do and who we are.

488
00:22:08.512 --> 00:22:12.304
We don’t need to use crass
comments and shout about it.

489
00:22:12.304 --> 00:22:14.720
People know that we are good
at science and we’re

490
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.595
good at what we do.

491
00:22:16.595 --> 00:22:20.679
But so is the rest of the world,
and this is a time for all of us

492
00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:23.095
to celebrate what happened
and to come together and not

493
00:22:23.095 --> 00:22:25.179
to try and, you know,
make some cheap points,

494
00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:26.220
I think.

495
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.095
Alex?

496
00:22:28.095 --> 00:22:31.012
I really do think we need
to get away from this idea

497
00:22:31.012 --> 00:22:32.012
of vaccine nationalism.

498
00:22:32.012 --> 00:22:33.054
I completely agree.

499
00:22:33.054 --> 00:22:35.179
We all really need to
be in this together.

500
00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:37.887
We should all be working together
to get the vaccine out

501
00:22:37.887 --> 00:22:40.179
as quickly as we can,
ensuring that it’s safe

502
00:22:40.179 --> 00:22:44.179
and that it’s effective,
and I think that kind of...

503
00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:46.845
The point we made earlier,
you know, that’s why I think

504
00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:49.262
Gavin Williamson’s comments
were very, very unhelpful.

505
00:22:49.262 --> 00:22:52.137
You know, it wasn’t diplomatic.

506
00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:55.012
It’s not particularly helpful
considering the Brexit negotiations,

507
00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:57.887
so I think, you know,
the world knows that British

508
00:22:57.887 --> 00:23:01.095
scientists are amongst the best,
but I really don’t think those

509
00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:05.429
comments were helpful and I think
we should all be clubbing together

510
00:23:05.429 --> 00:23:07.679
and doing everything possible
as an international community.

511
00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:08.720
Tom?

512
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.220
It felt really quite toe—curlingly
cringing this morning,

513
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.304
the words that were coming out.

514
00:23:16.304 --> 00:23:19.637
It turned into some kind of
political points scoring space race.

515
00:23:19.637 --> 00:23:23.179
And, I mean, how the science has
worked together to make this

516
00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:25.220
happen has been amazing.

517
00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.512
Lots of vaccines being announced
that pretty much the same time.

518
00:23:28.512 --> 00:23:30.887
Clearly, the scientists have been
working together to create something

519
00:23:30.887 --> 00:23:33.512
that solves a world problem,
and it’s something that we should

520
00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:38.512
all be so proud of, and this morning
those comments that were coming out,

521
00:23:38.679 --> 00:23:42.887
I said it and like someone
was saying, that bit where you talk

522
00:23:42.887 --> 00:23:45.679
about your child thinking he’s
the best or whatever,

523
00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:49.095
and Ifound it quite embarrassing
this morning, those comments.

524
00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:51.470
Yeah, a little toe curling.

525
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.637
Patrick, you’ve got your hand up?

526
00:23:53.637 --> 00:23:56.470
Yeah, thank you.

527
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.387
I’ve only ever been
involved from the periphery

528
00:23:58.387 --> 00:24:03.429
with the regulatory process
of medicine, but as I understand it

529
00:24:08.887 --> 00:24:12.470
the MHRA have run some of the phases
and some of the steps in parallel

530
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.387
with each other rather
than sequentially, with some

531
00:24:14.387 --> 00:24:16.095
overlap between them,
and that’s what short

532
00:24:16.095 --> 00:24:17.137
and everything.

533
00:24:17.137 --> 00:24:19.762
But I think the MHRA
is an institution with a significant

534
00:24:19.762 --> 00:24:22.137
international reputation and it
will stand by having done that

535
00:24:22.137 --> 00:24:24.262
and it willjustify not
having cut any corners,

536
00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:29.304
so I feel quite confident
in what they’ve done.

537
00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:34.554
Matthew T — I’ll call you Matthew T
because we’ve got two

538
00:24:34.554 --> 00:24:35.595
Matthews in her audience.

539
00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:36.637
Thank you.

540
00:24:36.637 --> 00:24:38.762
I was wondering, instead
of obviously saying crass comments,

541
00:24:38.762 --> 00:24:40.929
how would the panel suggest
that we should collaborate

542
00:24:40.929 --> 00:24:45.054
with other nations better
during this whole vaccine roll—out?

543
00:24:45.054 --> 00:24:46.887
Gosh, now that is a big question.

544
00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:50.054
Liam, feel free to tackle that,
but let’s also look at the original

545
00:24:50.054 --> 00:24:52.637
question, which is has our departure
from the European Union actually

546
00:24:52.637 --> 00:24:57.679
helped in speeding up the process
to approve the vaccine?

547
00:24:58.637 --> 00:25:00.804
Well, the response to Catherine’s
original question, I mean,

548
00:25:00.804 --> 00:25:03.429
people can take from this
what they will, and it’s kind

549
00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:06.262
of depressing that we are still
fighting the referendum ofJune 2016

550
00:25:06.262 --> 00:25:07.762
even at this very late stage.

551
00:25:07.762 --> 00:25:10.345
As a point of fact, that
you could have invoked emergency

552
00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:14.095
powers to speed up the regulatory
process, but it chose not to,

553
00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:17.179
and if we were still part
of the European Union we would be

554
00:25:17.179 --> 00:25:19.554
part of that collective decision.

555
00:25:19.554 --> 00:25:24.095
We decided to not be part of that,
and that’s why, as a point of fact,

556
00:25:24.095 --> 00:25:29.095
we were able to approve this
vaccine slightly quicker.

557
00:25:29.554 --> 00:25:31.887
But individual countries can
take individual powers

558
00:25:31.887 --> 00:25:33.804
to do it individually,
even within the EU.

559
00:25:33.804 --> 00:25:37.470
They can, in principle, but they’ve
agreed between them to not do that,

560
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.637
and we would have been part
of that decision.

561
00:25:39.637 --> 00:25:40.762
That’s just factually accurate.

562
00:25:40.762 --> 00:25:44.179
That’s what it is.

563
00:25:44.179 --> 00:25:46.304
What I didn’t like, I mean,
the European medical

564
00:25:46.304 --> 00:25:49.012
agency again yesterday,
before Gavin Williamson’s comments —

565
00:25:49.012 --> 00:25:52.595
which I agree were completely crass,
and if it was a joke it went badly

566
00:25:52.595 --> 00:25:55.012
wrong — but the European medical
agency yesterday was casting

567
00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:59.720
aspersions on our regulatory testing
regime, which the WHO has described

568
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.679
as world class and is widely
seen as world class.

569
00:26:02.679 --> 00:26:04.554
That’s not a nationalistic
thing to say, again,

570
00:26:04.554 --> 00:26:07.179
it’s just a point of fact.

571
00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:10.095
And I think once you get into this
folly of different parts

572
00:26:10.095 --> 00:26:14.095
of the world, politicians
chest—beating, saying "Our

573
00:26:14.095 --> 00:26:16.429
regulations are better
than your regulations",

574
00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:20.554
look, as people with public
platforms scientists, journalists,

575
00:26:20.554 --> 00:26:24.637
we’ll have a big responsibility
here.

576
00:26:24.637 --> 00:26:27.762
Quite a lot of our population,
and maybe we will come onto this,

577
00:26:27.762 --> 00:26:29.470
Fiona, is concerned
about taking this vaccine.

578
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.595
A much smaller proportion,
I’d say, well, it’s true,

579
00:26:31.595 --> 00:26:34.220
here in the UK than in many other
countries in Europe

580
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.262
and across the world.

581
00:26:35.262 --> 00:26:37.887
We don’t want to get into some
Dutch auction of whose

582
00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:40.304
regulator is better.

583
00:26:40.304 --> 00:26:43.720
The fact is we did do the phase one,
two and three tests here.

584
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.970
The Chinese and Russians have got
vaccines, which they are rolling out

585
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.179
before they completed those
phase three tests.

586
00:26:49.179 --> 00:26:52.554
And it was very good to hear
from Peter some of the reasons why,

587
00:26:52.554 --> 00:26:55.429
and indeed from our audience,
from Matthew, why it is that we’ve

588
00:26:55.429 --> 00:26:58.762
managed to truncate this by doing
different things in parallel.

589
00:26:58.762 --> 00:27:00.887
Vaccines take years,
but usually you’re trying

590
00:27:00.887 --> 00:27:05.929
to generate funding all the time,
and we obviously don’t have that.

591
00:27:07.804 --> 00:27:10.179
I’d like to see us getting
beyond this vaccine nationalism,

592
00:27:10.179 --> 00:27:13.095
which I think Gavin Williamson’s
comments played into,

593
00:27:13.095 --> 00:27:16.179
and I think we’ve all had enough
of this virus around the world.

594
00:27:16.179 --> 00:27:20.970
We want to see our leaders getting
on and supporting each other,

595
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.345
calling out regulatory slips
where we can see them happening,

596
00:27:23.345 --> 00:27:25.762
but supporting each other
when we can see the responsible

597
00:27:25.762 --> 00:27:30.804
regulatory bodies are
doing theirjob, whoever

598
00:27:31.012 --> 00:27:32.429
gets there a few weeks first.

599
00:27:32.429 --> 00:27:33.512
0K.

600
00:27:33.512 --> 00:27:35.554
I’m going to move on in a minute,
but before I do I want to mention

601
00:27:35.554 --> 00:27:37.304
I’m going to move on in a minute,
but before I do I want to mention

602
00:27:37.304 --> 00:27:40.179
that next week we are looking
for people to join our virtual

603
00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:41.220
audience from Chelmsford.

604
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.179
That is our last programme before
Christmas, actually.

605
00:27:43.179 --> 00:27:46.304
So next week it’s from Chelmsford,
and also Ijust wanted to let

606
00:27:46.304 --> 00:27:48.929
you know that we are introducing
a new kind of audience

607
00:27:48.929 --> 00:27:49.970
after Christmas.

608
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.345
50 early next year,
that is until we can get

609
00:27:52.345 --> 00:27:54.512
back on the road again
and have an audience

610
00:27:54.512 --> 00:27:58.137
here in the studio like we used to,
so we are looking for 50 people

611
00:27:58.137 --> 00:28:01.470
from across the whole of the UK
to be part of a regular audience,

612
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.887
and we will then take our audience
from that pre—selected

613
00:28:03.887 --> 00:28:04.929
group of 50 people.

614
00:28:04.929 --> 00:28:08.762
So if you want to be part of that,
and obviously you need to have some

615
00:28:08.762 --> 00:28:12.137
opinions and be free most Thursday
nights, but if you want to be part

616
00:28:12.137 --> 00:28:16.970
of that go to the Question Time
website and you can see how

617
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.095
to apply.

618
00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:19.512
We love to hear from you.

619
00:28:19.512 --> 00:28:20.762
Do be part of that.

620
00:28:20.762 --> 00:28:24.845
It will be called the QT 50, so look
for that on the website, the QT 50.

621
00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:27.679
Right, and of course in the meantime
if you live around Chelmsford

622
00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:28.762
apply for next week.

623
00:28:28.762 --> 00:28:30.929
So let’s take our next programme
from Matthew Batchelor.

624
00:28:30.929 --> 00:28:31.929
Matthew?

625
00:28:31.929 --> 00:28:33.012
Good evening.

626
00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:35.720
Why can everyone pile into town
shopping centres by the thousands,

627
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.304
but less than 100 people can’t sit
at tables in pubs?

628
00:28:38.304 --> 00:28:40.304
Matthew, are you asking this
from personal experience?

629
00:28:40.304 --> 00:28:42.304
Yes.

630
00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:45.929
You can control people in a pub
because they have to sit at a table

631
00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:47.845
and they stay there,
whereas in shopping centres

632
00:28:47.845 --> 00:28:49.929
they pretty much run
round everywhere and do

633
00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:50.970
what they want.

634
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.637
And this is because you
work in a pub, do you?

635
00:28:53.637 --> 00:28:54.637
Yes.

636
00:28:54.637 --> 00:28:56.970
And are you working at the moment?

637
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.095
No, I’m on furlough at the moment,
until the 16th of December,

638
00:29:01.095 --> 00:29:06.137
depending on if we stay in Tier 3
or go to Tier 2.

639
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.554
So I’m assuming, because Bath
is in Tier 2, but you must

640
00:29:09.554 --> 00:29:11.720
just be outside, then,
in 3 Tier 3 area?

641
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.804
Just outside.

642
00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:16.012
Literally 200 yards, my pub is,
from being in Tier 2.

643
00:29:16.012 --> 00:29:18.262
Right.

644
00:29:18.262 --> 00:29:20.804
Well, Tom, obviously I’m
going to come to you first.

645
00:29:20.804 --> 00:29:21.845
Yeah.

646
00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:25.262
I mean, hospitality,
like Matthew was saying

647
00:29:25.262 --> 00:29:28.012
there has been hugely exposed
to all of this pandemic.

648
00:29:28.012 --> 00:29:31.429
It’s been the industry that’s
been at the front line,

649
00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:33.929
as well as travel and tourism,
aviation, all of those

650
00:29:33.929 --> 00:29:36.512
sort of industries have
all been hit massively,

651
00:29:36.512 --> 00:29:41.554
but from my point of view
hospitality is under a huge amount

652
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.345
of pressure right now.

653
00:29:44.345 --> 00:29:48.179
We are able to open 200 yards away
from Matthew, but you’re not now.

654
00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:51.637
All these contradictory questions.

655
00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:54.512
And the problem that you come
across is that so many pubs,

656
00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:56.720
so many restaurants,
hotels, have spent so much money

657
00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.887
over a period of time
being able to reopen,

658
00:29:58.887 --> 00:30:01.845
reinvest, try to make
themselves Covid secure,

659
00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:05.137
trying to make sure health
and safety is being adhered to,

660
00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:10.095
risk assessments done,
PPE, social distancing.

661
00:30:10.845 --> 00:30:13.595
So we get through that first
lockdown period, where,

662
00:30:13.595 --> 00:30:16.220
to be fair to the Government,
the furlough scheme that Matthew’s

663
00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.220
on, has been incredibly helpful
from a starting point of view,

664
00:30:22.012 --> 00:30:24.304
but moving forward to open
within the industry it does

665
00:30:24.304 --> 00:30:25.345
need much more help.

666
00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:27.512
There are pubs that are closed
now losing thousands

667
00:30:27.512 --> 00:30:28.595
upon thousands of pounds.

668
00:30:28.595 --> 00:30:30.220
What would you like to see happen?

669
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.387
Moving forward, I mean, the future,
first of all we need plenty of

670
00:30:33.387 --> 00:30:34.887
investment.

671
00:30:34.887 --> 00:30:38.762
The Government has proposed
a grant of, what is it,

672
00:30:38.762 --> 00:30:42.470
£1,000, a one—off payment to pubs
that can’t serve food...

673
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.887
Yeah, it shouts it out
as A0 million, and

674
00:30:44.887 --> 00:30:47.470
then by the time you break that
down to wet—led pubs.

675
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.887
Wet—led pubs have been
one of the worst hit in

676
00:30:49.887 --> 00:30:50.970
this.

677
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.887
And just to be clear,
because not everyone’s

678
00:30:52.887 --> 00:30:53.929
as familiar with the

679
00:30:53.929 --> 00:30:56.095
terminology as you,
so that’s a pub that can’t...

680
00:30:56.095 --> 00:30:58.220
That doesn’t serve substantial
meals — itjust serves

681
00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.220
mostly drinks and snacks.

682
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.262
Mostly drinks.

683
00:31:00.262 --> 00:31:02.970
The community pubs, the places
where people go and meet up,

684
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.595
the people that hang
out, the people...

685
00:31:04.595 --> 00:31:09.595
That are the centres
of people’s hearts and souls,

686
00:31:10.054 --> 00:31:13.554
these are the pubs
that are massively

687
00:31:13.554 --> 00:31:15.470
being hit, that don’t
serve a Scotch egg.

688
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.887
These are the places that,
you know, are wet—led pubs.

689
00:31:17.887 --> 00:31:19.304
With a pickle on the side.

690
00:31:19.304 --> 00:31:20.720
With a pickle on the side.

691
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.637
So the grant that I mean,
I interrupted you to just explain

692
00:31:23.637 --> 00:31:25.554
what the word meant,
but we were talking

693
00:31:25.554 --> 00:31:26.720
about the grant from
the

694
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.804
Government.

695
00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:30.179
Yeah, so that A0 million,
by the time that’s been

696
00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:33.512
spread out to wet led pubs, 0K,
these are the places that have not

697
00:31:33.512 --> 00:31:34.595
had that VAT cut.

698
00:31:34.595 --> 00:31:36.762
So even if they have
not been able to

699
00:31:36.762 --> 00:31:38.179
operate, their turnover
figures, they haven’t

700
00:31:38.179 --> 00:31:39.387
got that 5096 where
the

701
00:31:39.387 --> 00:31:42.220
Government have come in and it’s
been very helpful for food and

702
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.179
hotels and accommodation,
but for these pubs they

703
00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:45.220
haven’t had that break.

704
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.262
Social distancing.

705
00:31:46.262 --> 00:31:49.595
Those pubs make very,
very small margins.

706
00:31:49.595 --> 00:31:51.762
I mean, there are small margins
in hospitality anyway.

707
00:31:51.762 --> 00:31:53.929
For those pubs, it is even
smaller on alcohol.

708
00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:56.095
There is a huge amount
of taxation on it.

709
00:31:56.095 --> 00:31:57.137
The actual spend...

710
00:31:57.137 --> 00:31:59.262
Well, look, you’ve got
a representative of the Government

711
00:31:59.262 --> 00:32:00.262
here.

712
00:32:00.262 --> 00:32:02.179
What would you like
the Government to do?

713
00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:04.887
I mean, the VAT cut,
it should he being pushed onto

714
00:32:04.887 --> 00:32:05.929
wet—led pubs, onto alcohol.

715
00:32:05.929 --> 00:32:07.845
The idea that the restrictions
that you make,

716
00:32:07.845 --> 00:32:10.720
that people are not allowed to go
into pubs unless they’re having

717
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.679
something to eat, the question that
Matthew’s asking about

718
00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:18.262
shopping centres or pubs, I mean,
there is no real difference.

719
00:32:18.262 --> 00:32:20.970
We are all grown adults.

720
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.637
Surely you can go out
and have a drink socially rather

721
00:32:23.637 --> 00:32:29.345
than shopping.

722
00:32:33.929 --> 00:32:36.137
The idea that alcohol is driven
to people’s behaviour,

723
00:32:36.137 --> 00:32:39.220
the way that it changes —
there are plenty of people thatjust

724
00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.637
enjoy socially mixing,
hanging out, under

725
00:32:40.637 --> 00:32:42.804
Covid—safe environments,
making sure that they can be there.

726
00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:47.012
That VAT cut should
be put onto pubs.

727
00:32:47.012 --> 00:32:49.595
Michelle, do you want
to tackle this?

728
00:32:49.595 --> 00:32:54.595
Yeah, well, first of all, I’lljust
say I totally agree with you.

729
00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:57.304
Pubs have gone above and beyond to
try to get Covid—secure,

730
00:32:57.304 --> 00:32:59.720
and the impact on the hospitality
sector has been awful.

731
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.137
I’ve seen that in my own
constituency, with countless people

732
00:33:02.137 --> 00:33:04.512
having to be furloughed,
just like members of this audience.

733
00:33:04.512 --> 00:33:06.679
And the £1000, I don’t
think we canjust

734
00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:08.595
target and focus on that,
because that’s part

735
00:33:08.595 --> 00:33:09.637
of the bigger context.

736
00:33:09.637 --> 00:33:11.804
A pub that has to
close at the moment

737
00:33:11.804 --> 00:33:12.804
also gets £3000.

738
00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:17.512
They got up to £25,000
in the first tranche.

739
00:33:17.512 --> 00:33:19.179
There is the furlough
scheme, there’s also

740
00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:20.387
the VAT, down to 5%...

741
00:33:20.387 --> 00:33:22.179
Not on wet—led pubs.

742
00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:25.304
No, no, yes, but what I’m saying
is this is part of a

743
00:33:25.304 --> 00:33:27.970
broader package.

744
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.345
It won’t be applicable
to all of them, but the

745
00:33:30.345 --> 00:33:31.387
majority is to most.

746
00:33:31.387 --> 00:33:36.095
So we can’tjust focus on that 1000.

747
00:33:36.095 --> 00:33:38.679
I think the Prime Minister
was announcing that as an additional

748
00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:40.304
support, an additional help.

749
00:33:40.304 --> 00:33:42.470
And I hear what you’re
saying about "Why pubs?

750
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.387
"Why have pubs been
unfairly hit or targeted?"

751
00:33:44.387 --> 00:33:46.304
And no politician wants
to make these choices.

752
00:33:46.304 --> 00:33:51.304
I didn’t enter politics
to close down pubs.

753
00:33:51.637 --> 00:33:53.345
But you could make the choice.

754
00:33:53.345 --> 00:33:58.387
You can make the choice to give
more support to pubs.

755
00:33:59.179 --> 00:34:02.970
But I think that the point
that was also being made was,

756
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.845
"Why are we actually making these
decisions in the first place?", and

757
00:34:05.845 --> 00:34:07.512
it’s fundamentally
for public health and safety,

758
00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:08.554
directed by the science...

759
00:34:08.554 --> 00:34:10.220
Government Public Health England,
transmission rates in

760
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.262
hospitality was at 3%.

761
00:34:11.262 --> 00:34:12.304
That’s right.

762
00:34:12.304 --> 00:34:13.762
Between 3% and 5%
within hospitality.

763
00:34:13.762 --> 00:34:15.179
And 10% of the workforce,
hospitality...

764
00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:20.179
Hospitality also employs
over 3 million people.

765
00:34:22.762 --> 00:34:25.929
It’s sat there, and we saw
the Eat Out To Help Out scheme,

766
00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.054
places where the infection rate
did not rise then.

767
00:34:28.054 --> 00:34:30.429
The infection rate rises came
when students were moving up

768
00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:31.470
and down the country...

769
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.179
I don’t think we should
blame students.

770
00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:35.304
I’m not blaming students,
I’m blaming movement of people.

771
00:34:35.304 --> 00:34:36.554
The students aren’t to blame.

772
00:34:36.554 --> 00:34:38.179
If the movement of people.

773
00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:39.262
0K.

774
00:34:39.262 --> 00:34:43.262
We’ve got Peter.

775
00:34:43.262 --> 00:34:46.387
Peter, do you want to pitch in here,
since you’re clearly the man

776
00:34:46.387 --> 00:34:48.554
who is looking at this evidence,
as a scientist?

777
00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:51.429
So I think it’s very clear
that there are things that transmit

778
00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:53.595
the virus really well,
and that’s often in venues

779
00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:56.470
where there is poor ventilation,
loud music, and people have to shout

780
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.179
to overcome the noise,
and then you are emitting a lot

781
00:34:59.179 --> 00:35:01.970
of snifﬂe particles which contain
a lot of the virus, so that’s

782
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.970
a perfect transmission environment.

783
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.304
If you have a quiet environment
with well—ventilated areas

784
00:35:08.304 --> 00:35:13.345
and where you can actually have
social separation, and there

785
00:35:13.595 --> 00:35:16.970
are lots of very well—managed places
where you can go and have a meal

786
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.595
and so on and drink a pint
at the same time,

787
00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:24.595
where the transmission risk
is very, very low.

788
00:35:29.554 --> 00:35:31.970
But I think it has been
clear that loud music

789
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.887
and shouting in an enclosed
environment is perfect

790
00:35:33.887 --> 00:35:35.137
for transmission of the virus.

791
00:35:35.137 --> 00:35:37.470
So if it was a pub that
wasn’t playing music,

792
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.637
would you be happy for peopla
to go there?

793
00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:41.554
I personally would feel
quite comfortable to go

794
00:35:41.554 --> 00:35:43.720
into a pub where it was
quiet, well ventilated,

795
00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.137
and where you could actually
keep your distance from people.

796
00:35:46.137 --> 00:35:48.262
This is an industry
that is on its knees,

797
00:35:48.262 --> 00:35:49.345
and these aren’tjust...

798
00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:50.804
These are places that are closing.

799
00:35:50.804 --> 00:35:54.554
It’s an industry that was struggling
before Covid came along,

800
00:35:54.554 --> 00:35:58.387
and now we are at a point where many
loans have been taken out to be

801
00:35:58.387 --> 00:36:01.095
able to get to reopen,
and then being put into tiered

802
00:36:01.095 --> 00:36:03.012
systems where the evidence
for their closure has

803
00:36:03.012 --> 00:36:04.054
been pretty selective.
Tom. . .

804
00:36:04.054 --> 00:36:06.470
I’m sorry to interrupt you.

805
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.554
It’s not because we don’t
want to hear what you’ve got to say,

806
00:36:09.554 --> 00:36:14.554
but I need to let everyone else
in as well.

807
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.262
Obviously you feel so passionately,
as of course you do —

808
00:36:18.262 --> 00:36:21.762
this is the absolute heart and soul
of what you do.

809
00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:26.720
Let’s hear a bit more
from our audience.

810
00:36:27.012 --> 00:36:29.845
Yeah, Ijust wanted to say,
this is an argument that’s going

811
00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:31.595
to rumble on for months to come.

812
00:36:31.595 --> 00:36:33.929
Don’t we all think it’s
time we have a Minister

813
00:36:33.929 --> 00:36:34.970
in Parliament for Hospitality?

814
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.179
Tom is nodding at that.

815
00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:37.845
Andy?

816
00:36:37.845 --> 00:36:39.929
He wants the job!

817
00:36:39.929 --> 00:36:40.970
LAUGHTER

818
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.887
It could be
a new gig for you!

819
00:36:42.887 --> 00:36:43.970
Andy?

820
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.804
I think the hospitality industry has
been given some guidelines,

821
00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:49.637
and I think in some way it can be
self regulated because,

822
00:36:49.637 --> 00:36:53.012
from my point of view,
if I was going to go to a restaurant

823
00:36:53.012 --> 00:36:56.179
and I thought they were sticking
to the guidelines well,

824
00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:58.887
I’d go to that restaurant,
or I’d go to that pub.

825
00:36:58.887 --> 00:37:01.679
And you can see some that maybe
aren’t doing it so well,

826
00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:02.970
maybe you wouldn’t visit those.

827
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.345
So I think as long as there
are guidelines, really,

828
00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:06.804
these places need to be open.

829
00:37:06.804 --> 00:37:09.179
I’m sure they need to be
open because, you know,

830
00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:12.512
there are a lot ofjobs at stake
in this sector, so, you know,

831
00:37:12.512 --> 00:37:15.345
a little bit of self regulating,
I think, and then people can

832
00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:16.429
make their own choice.

833
00:37:16.429 --> 00:37:19.095
"I’m not going to go in that
pub because it looks

834
00:37:19.095 --> 00:37:20.220
too busy and too loud."

835
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.262
Anya?

836
00:37:26.429 --> 00:37:28.304
I completely agree
with what Andy’s saying.

837
00:37:28.304 --> 00:37:31.179
I think it’s really important
we do keep a lot of these

838
00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:33.429
hospitality places open,
because especially for students

839
00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:36.720
who are using things like this to
get through college and university.

840
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.137
It’s really hard when you’re
not making that money,

841
00:37:39.137 --> 00:37:42.304
and it has had a knock—on effect.

842
00:37:42.304 --> 00:37:45.720
Not only are the pubs not doing
well, but it’s also had a knock—on

843
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.387
effect for the employees
who work there.

844
00:37:47.387 --> 00:37:48.804
And I think it’s a bit...

845
00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:51.470
It’s something that you have
to work on, so as long

846
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.137
as they are doing their bit
and keeping it well ventilated

847
00:37:54.137 --> 00:37:58.345
and following guidelines,
it’s a bit like school.

848
00:37:58.345 --> 00:38:03.387
Schools are open, they are all
socialising in big numbers,

849
00:38:06.304 --> 00:38:11.345
and I think if we can do that
at school it’s not...

850
00:38:13.012 --> 00:38:14.929
Like, it’s had a big
effect on hospitality

851
00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:15.970
by shutting down those.

852
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:16.970
Liam?

853
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.137
As I said, the hospitality
sector employs, you know,

854
00:38:19.137 --> 00:38:21.804
10% of the workforce,
and it doesn’t give me any pleasure

855
00:38:21.804 --> 00:38:24.679
to say it but we are facing
a tsunami of unemployment here,

856
00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:27.512
and with the best will in the world
even though the vaccine

857
00:38:27.512 --> 00:38:30.679
is clearly on the way,
and Amen to that, but we could have

858
00:38:30.679 --> 00:38:32.595
another three, four, five,
six months of lockdown,

859
00:38:32.595 --> 00:38:35.970
and I personally think we need to be
much smarter about how we lockdown.

860
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.845
Locking us down by region is too
much of a blunt instrument.

861
00:38:38.845 --> 00:38:41.637
Look at the case of Kent,
where you’ve got high infections

862
00:38:41.637 --> 00:38:44.470
on the Medway towns but then
in rural Kent you have some

863
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.512
of the lowest infection
rates in the country.

864
00:38:51.554 --> 00:38:54.012
The Covid Recovery Group
in the Commons earlier this week,

865
00:38:54.012 --> 00:38:57.137
they pushed the Prime Minister
to say he wants to be more granular,

866
00:38:57.137 --> 00:38:59.470
breaking down regions
into particular areas,

867
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.637
so that country pub where our
resident scientist says

868
00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:04.095
there really is no danger,
as long as it’s well

869
00:39:04.095 --> 00:39:06.220
ventilated, you know,
that’s a family with their house,

870
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.429
their mortgage, their life savings.

871
00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:12.345
And Tom’s nodding from the waist.

872
00:39:12.345 --> 00:39:15.220
So we have to help businesses to get
through what could be

873
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.179
another six months of this,
and, yes, we can offer more help,

874
00:39:20.512 --> 00:39:23.179
and we want to see that,
but we’re borrowing £400 billion

875
00:39:23.179 --> 00:39:25.470
this year, in a single year.

876
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:29.845
I mean, this is completely
outlandish amounts of money.

877
00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:32.970
There has to be a limit to just
throwing money at a situation.

878
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.887
It’s now costing us
£1 billion a day.

879
00:39:34.887 --> 00:39:38.012
So if it’s not question of money,
what are you suggesting it is?

880
00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:42.637
Is it a question of
opening up these areas?

881
00:39:42.637 --> 00:39:45.470
I think we need to lockdown
in a much more granularfashion,

882
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:50.137
more geographically specific.

883
00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:53.429
And, also, it’s often pooh—poohed,
that I think there is a case for age

884
00:39:53.429 --> 00:39:55.179
stratification when it comes
to lockdown, letting

885
00:39:55.179 --> 00:39:57.512
the younger generation get out
there and do their thing,

886
00:39:57.512 --> 00:39:59.720
shielding the elderly,
if they want to be shielded.

887
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.345
People often say that’s
impossible because there

888
00:40:01.345 --> 00:40:02.429
are multi—generational households.

889
00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:07.429
You know, Fiona, 92%
of all British workers,

890
00:40:07.804 --> 00:40:10.387
people of working age,
do not live with anyone over 65,

891
00:40:10.387 --> 00:40:12.512
where the vast majority
of Covid fatalities and very

892
00:40:12.512 --> 00:40:17.179
serious cases occur.

893
00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:20.262
We can use unused hotels if we need
to, where you do have

894
00:40:20.262 --> 00:40:25.262
multi—generationalfamilies,
so workers aren’t coming home,

895
00:40:26.429 --> 00:40:28.554
and, in the fabled unfortunate
phrase, killing their granny.

896
00:40:28.554 --> 00:40:31.387
That would be a lot cheaper
than keeping the economy shuttered.

897
00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:34.054
It’s notjust the money we’re
spending every day on lockdown

898
00:40:34.054 --> 00:40:36.095
in terms of furlough
and business support.

899
00:40:36.095 --> 00:40:38.762
It’s the taxes we’re not raising.

900
00:40:38.762 --> 00:40:41.804
And, you know, unless we’re
going to have a major economic

901
00:40:41.804 --> 00:40:44.095
overhang going on for years
and years and years,

902
00:40:44.095 --> 00:40:46.012
and the difficulty of funding
infrastructure, public services,

903
00:40:46.012 --> 00:40:48.179
all the things we need
going forward, we have

904
00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:53.179
to get our economy moving again.

905
00:40:54.679 --> 00:40:57.554
Peter, since we’ve got you here,
there’s an argument that a number

906
00:40:57.554 --> 00:40:59.970
of people have raised in the press
and occasionally in

907
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.012
this programme too.

908
00:41:01.012 --> 00:41:03.179
This idea of stratification,
as you are calling it,

909
00:41:03.179 --> 00:41:05.304
but basically shielding certain
sections of the population, letting

910
00:41:05.304 --> 00:41:06.762
the others have much more freedom.

911
00:41:06.762 --> 00:41:08.179
Are you convinced by that?

912
00:41:08.179 --> 00:41:08.387
ﬂ

913
00:41:08.387 --> 00:41:15.054
I think we know that if we try that
then it is going eventually to work

914
00:41:15.054 --> 00:41:17.595
then it is going eventually to work
its way up to the most vulnerable.

915
00:41:17.595 --> 00:41:19.179
its way up to the most vulnerable.
Admittedly, there is very good

916
00:41:19.179 --> 00:41:21.012
Admittedly, there is very good
evidence that the most vulnerable

917
00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:22.762
evidence that the most vulnerable
are managed to screen themselves off

918
00:41:22.762 --> 00:41:26.137
are managed to screen themselves off
still, and there is a declining rate

919
00:41:26.137 --> 00:41:27.679
still, and there is a declining rate
of disease transmission still in

920
00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:29.804
of disease transmission still in
those most vulnerable people, but it

921
00:41:29.804 --> 00:41:32.512
those most vulnerable people, but it
is inevitable and we have seen this

922
00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:35.762
is inevitable and we have seen this
in many locations, that when you try

923
00:41:35.762 --> 00:41:38.304
in many locations, that when you try
to allow the rate to go up a little

924
00:41:38.304 --> 00:41:41.220
to allow the rate to go up a little
bit in order to open businesses that

925
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.179
bit in order to open businesses that
inevitably it does climb through

926
00:41:43.179 --> 00:41:44.262
inevitably it does climb through
into the vulnerable population, so

927
00:41:44.262 --> 00:41:45.762
into the vulnerable population, so
it is a really difficult problem,

928
00:41:45.762 --> 00:41:46.470
it is a really difficult problam,
and I so

929
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.179
it is a really difficult problem,
and I so hope we can get the

930
00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:48.345
and I so hope we ran get the
vaccines

931
00:41:48.345 --> 00:41:48.887
and I so hope we can get the
vaccines into those vulnerable

932
00:41:48.887 --> 00:41:51.929
vaccines into those vulnerable
populations so that that effect

933
00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:55.845
populations so that that effect
won’t occur. Sarah? I think I

934
00:41:55.845 --> 00:41:56.179
won’t occur. Sarah? Ithinkl
completely

935
00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:57.762
won’t occur. Sarah? I think I
completely agree with Liam’s

936
00:41:57.762 --> 00:41:59.387
completely agree with Liam’s
frustration but I don’t agree with

937
00:41:59.387 --> 00:41:59.554
fmstration but I don’t agree with
his

938
00:41:59.554 --> 00:42:01.720
frustration but I don’t agree with
his solution. I think there are

939
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.012
his solution. I think there are
several things here. Firstly,

940
00:42:03.012 --> 00:42:03.304
his solution. I think there are
severalthings here. Firstly, in

941
00:42:03.304 --> 00:42:04.137
several things here. Firstly, in
defence

942
00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:05.387
severalthings here. Firstly, in
defence of the tier system, which I

943
00:42:05.387 --> 00:42:07.762
defence of the tier system, which I
will do on the half of the

944
00:42:07.762 --> 00:42:10.845
will do on the half of the
Government, when you decide that you

945
00:42:10.845 --> 00:42:12.387
Government, when you decide that you
are not going to have complete

946
00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:13.804
are not going to have complete
lockdown with everyone staying at

947
00:42:13.804 --> 00:42:15.470
lockdown with everyone staying at
home and when you decide you are not

948
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.262
home and when you decide you are not
going to have the absolute opposite,

949
00:42:17.262 --> 00:42:21.262
going to have the absolute opposite,
you have to draw the line somewhere,

950
00:42:21.262 --> 00:42:22.387
you have to draw the line somewhere,
and there will always be really

951
00:42:22.387 --> 00:42:23.470
and there will always be really
horrible peculiarities in the way

952
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.012
horrible peculiarities in the way
you draw that line because things

953
00:42:25.012 --> 00:42:27.095
you draw that line because things
will not make sense at that point...

954
00:42:27.095 --> 00:42:30.470
will not make sense at that point...
The areas are too big. That is my

955
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.679
The areas are too big. That is my
first point. Second point, when you

956
00:42:31.679 --> 00:42:33.804
first point. Second point, when you
draw that line and say to pubs, you

957
00:42:33.804 --> 00:42:36.012
draw that line and say to pubs, you
can’t make a living now properly,

958
00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:36.804
can’t make a living now property,
you have to

959
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:37.637
can’t make a living now properly,
you have to provide the support, and

960
00:42:37.637 --> 00:42:39.387
you have to provide the support, and
the support they are getting now is

961
00:42:39.387 --> 00:42:39.970
the support they are getting now is
a third of

962
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.179
the support they are getting new is
a third of what it was, and in the

963
00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:42.804
a third of what it was, and in the
areas where they have been on

964
00:42:42.804 --> 00:42:44.470
areas where they have been on
lockdown for months they are getting

965
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.262
lockdown for months they are getting
the same, the additional grant, to

966
00:42:46.262 --> 00:42:47.929
the same, the additional grant, to
make separate grants, and you get

967
00:42:47.929 --> 00:42:49.887
make separate grants, and you get
the same if you are in the Isle of

968
00:42:49.887 --> 00:42:50.804
the same if you are in the Isla of
Wight as if you

969
00:42:50.804 --> 00:42:51.262
the same if you are in the Isle of
Wight as if you are in Manchester

970
00:42:51.262 --> 00:42:52.595
Wight as if you are in Manchester
where you have been lockdown for

971
00:42:52.595 --> 00:42:54.554
where you have been lockdown for
months and that is simply not fair.

972
00:42:54.554 --> 00:42:56.595
months and that is simply not fair.
In April, there is a new tax regime,

973
00:42:56.595 --> 00:42:58.095
In April, there is a new tax regime,
you have to start spending, paying

974
00:42:58.095 --> 00:42:59.887
you have to start spending, paying
your business rates again, you will

975
00:42:59.887 --> 00:43:01.512
your business rates again, you will
have to start paying back all this

976
00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:08.762
have to start paying back all this
debt. There is a cut—off route ——

977
00:43:08.762 --> 00:43:09.679
debt. There is a cut-off route --
that the

978
00:43:09.679 --> 00:43:10.929
debt. There is a cut—off route ——
that the Government has to address.

979
00:43:10.929 --> 00:43:12.720
that the Government has to address.
And we have to do the simply not

980
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.179
And we have to do the simply not
just relying on the vaccine but

981
00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:15.804
just relying on the vaccine but
doing all the other things, having

982
00:43:15.804 --> 00:43:17.554
doing all the other things, having
the test entries in place, and by

983
00:43:17.554 --> 00:43:19.387
the test entries in place, and by
doing that we reduce the spread of

984
00:43:19.387 --> 00:43:21.345
doing that we reduce the spread of
this without, you know, just waiting

985
00:43:21.345 --> 00:43:22.887
this without, you know, just waiting
for the vaccine, because that will

986
00:43:22.887 --> 00:43:25.345
for the vaccine, because that will
take... I would say once you have

987
00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:27.512
take... I would say once you have
the 3.2 million people over 80

988
00:43:27.512 --> 00:43:27.804
the 3.2 million peopla over 80
safely

989
00:43:27.804 --> 00:43:28.637
the 3.2 million people over 80
safely vaccinated should they want

990
00:43:28.637 --> 00:43:31.179
safely vaccinated should they want
to take the vaccination, then you

991
00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:31.595
to take the vaccination, then you
ran start

992
00:43:31.595 --> 00:43:33.054
to take the vaccination, then you
can start moving towards a more age

993
00:43:33.054 --> 00:43:33.220
ran start moving towards a more age
stratified

994
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.220
can start moving towards a more age
stratified approach. We have a lot

995
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.804
stratified approach. We have a lot
of very smart people in this

996
00:43:35.804 --> 00:43:36.387
of very smart peopla in this
country, and

997
00:43:36.387 --> 00:43:37.887
of very smart people in this
country, and I agree with Education

998
00:43:37.887 --> 00:43:39.929
country, and I agree with Education
Secretary at least on that. We have

999
00:43:39.929 --> 00:43:42.012
Secretary at least on that. We have
to be more clever rather than just a

1000
00:43:42.012 --> 00:43:43.429
to be more clever rather than just a
blunt instrument of regional

1001
00:43:43.429 --> 00:43:45.012
blunt instrument of regional
lockdowns. Let’s take another

1002
00:43:45.012 --> 00:43:46.762
lockdowns. Let’s take another
question, because I want to fit in a

1003
00:43:46.762 --> 00:43:50.720
question, because I want to fit in a
few more with the time we have left.

1004
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.720
Hunt?

1005
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.637
With EU trade negotiations nearing
completion, would the government

1006
00:43:58.637 --> 00:44:01.304
still opt to walk away if EU
negotiators refuse to concede

1007
00:44:01.304 --> 00:44:04.179
on fishing, a sector worth less
than 0.1% of total UK GDP?

1008
00:44:04.179 --> 00:44:10.887
Michelle? When we had our Brexit
referendum, the key theme really was

1009
00:44:10.887 --> 00:44:12.970
referendum, the key theme really was
taking back control of our money,

1010
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.762
taking back control of our money,
our borders, laws and our waters,

1011
00:44:14.762 --> 00:44:16.387
our borders, laws and our waters,
which means fishing rights. I don’t

1012
00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:19.720
which means fishing rights. I don’t
it is unreasonable that, as an

1013
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.804
it is unreasonable that, as an
independent sovereign state, we want

1014
00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:22.970
independent sovereign state, we want
to be able to have that control over

1015
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.470
to be able to have that control over
our own water is on a fishing rights

1016
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.345
our own water is on a fishing rights
at all. We are not asking for

1017
00:44:27.345 --> 00:44:28.595
at all. We are not asking for
something that is unreasonable from

1018
00:44:28.595 --> 00:44:30.804
something that is unreasonable from
the EU or something they have not

1019
00:44:30.804 --> 00:44:32.554
the EU or something they have not
given to other nations. So this is

1020
00:44:32.554 --> 00:44:34.345
given to other nations. So this is
an important thing, and those

1021
00:44:34.345 --> 00:44:35.387
an important thing, and those
negotiations are still going on.

1022
00:44:35.387 --> 00:44:37.095
negotiations are still going on.
There is still the hope that we will

1023
00:44:37.095 --> 00:44:39.387
There is still the hope that we will
get a deal in time before the end...

1024
00:44:39.387 --> 00:44:40.387
get a deal in time before the end...
And I

1025
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:40.595
get a deal in time before the end...
And Ijust

1026
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:40.762
get a deal in time before the end...
And I just ask,

1027
00:44:40.762 --> 00:44:41.804
get a deal in time before the end...
And Ijust ask, then, because our

1028
00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:43.429
And Ijust ask, then, because our
political editor Laura Kuenssberg is

1029
00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:44.345
political editor [aura Kuenssberg is
reporting

1030
00:44:44.345 --> 00:44:45.012
political editor Laura Kuenssberg is
reporting tonight that the

1031
00:44:45.012 --> 00:44:46.845
reporting tonight that the
negotiations are going less well,

1032
00:44:46.845 --> 00:44:47.179
negotiations are going lass well,
and

1033
00:44:47.179 --> 00:44:49.637
negotiations are going less well,
and that the EU is throwing in a few

1034
00:44:49.637 --> 00:44:55.887
and that the EU is throwing in a few
new added things to be discussed. As

1035
00:44:55.887 --> 00:44:57.554
new added things to be discussed. As
you all know, Laura is not in the

1036
00:44:57.554 --> 00:44:57.720
you all know, [aura is not in the
negotiations

1037
00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.929
you all know, Laura is not in the
negotiations and neither am I, so I

1038
00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:01.179
negotiations and neither am I, so I
can’t give a blow by blow... But I’m

1039
00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:03.220
can’t give a blow by blow... But I’m
just asking what is happening. We

1040
00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.887
just asking what is happening. We
will find out over the coming days

1041
00:45:04.887 --> 00:45:06.262
will find out over the coming days
exactly what is happening. We have

1042
00:45:06.262 --> 00:45:07.595
exactly what is happening. We have
been very clear throughout this that

1043
00:45:07.595 --> 00:45:07.679
been very dear throughout this that
whether

1044
00:45:07.679 --> 00:45:09.720
been very clear throughout this that
whether we get a deal or not we will

1045
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.762
whether we get a deal or not we will
make a success of this, and I don’t

1046
00:45:11.762 --> 00:45:13.637
make a success of this, and I don’t
think it is helpful talking about

1047
00:45:13.637 --> 00:45:15.720
think it is helpful talking about
this all the time as a deal. We have

1048
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.762
this all the time as a deal. We have
a deal, the withdrawal agreement,

1049
00:45:17.762 --> 00:45:19.512
a deal, the withdrawal agreement,
which protects things like... But we

1050
00:45:19.512 --> 00:45:22.304
which protects things like... But we
are talking about a trade deal. We

1051
00:45:22.304 --> 00:45:24.804
are talking about a trade deal. We
are always harking back to where we

1052
00:45:24.804 --> 00:45:28.595
are always harking back to where we
wear a while ago with this no deal

1053
00:45:28.595 --> 00:45:28.637
wear a whila ago with this no deal
rhetoric,

1054
00:45:28.637 --> 00:45:31.179
wear a while ago with this no deal
rhetoric, really. Sarah Moore? I

1055
00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:31.804
wear a while ago with this no deal
rhetoric, really. Sarah Moore? Iwas

1056
00:45:31.804 --> 00:45:34.429
rhetoric, really. Sarah Moore? Iwas
asked on this programme on the 30th

1057
00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:35.179
asked on this programme on the 30th
of january --

1058
00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:35.345
asked on this programme on the 30th
ofjanuary -- and

1059
00:45:35.345 --> 00:45:36.929
asked on this programme on the 30th
ofJanuary —— and Sarah? The day

1060
00:45:36.929 --> 00:45:37.345
ofjanuary -- and Sarah? The day
before we

1061
00:45:37.345 --> 00:45:38.262
ofJanuary —— and Sarah? The day
before we left this programme, and I

1062
00:45:38.262 --> 00:45:40.262
before we left this programme, and I
remember saying we have no idea yet

1063
00:45:40.262 --> 00:45:41.720
remember saying we have no idea yet
what the final deal will look like.

1064
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.345
what the final deal will look like.
We still have no idea what the final

1065
00:45:43.345 --> 00:45:45.220
We still have no idea what the final
deal will look like ten months

1066
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.637
deal will look like ten months
later. It’s ridiculous. The fact the

1067
00:45:46.637 --> 00:45:47.887
later. It’s ridiculous. The fact the
Government have got to this point

1068
00:45:47.887 --> 00:45:49.429
Government have got to this point
where we are right at the cusp of

1069
00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:53.095
where we are right at the cusp of
the cut—off point is very bad

1070
00:45:53.095 --> 00:45:54.970
the cut—off point is very bad
management, and it’s a very poor

1071
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.512
management, and it’s a very poor
show. I think we know the deal is

1072
00:45:56.512 --> 00:45:58.304
show. I think we know the deal is
going to be thinner than it was

1073
00:45:58.304 --> 00:46:00.179
going to be thinner than it was
promised to be. I think we were

1074
00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:01.345
promised to be. I think we were
promised all bells and whistles, and

1075
00:46:01.345 --> 00:46:02.470
promised all bells and whisﬂas, and
it’s going to be

1076
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.179
promised all bells and whistles, and
it’s going to be thinner, and I

1077
00:46:03.179 --> 00:46:04.637
it’s going to be thinner, and I
think there are some very

1078
00:46:04.637 --> 00:46:06.470
think there are some very
significant issues we need to worry

1079
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.304
significant issues we need to worry
about. The Government have told us

1080
00:46:08.304 --> 00:46:10.345
about. The Government have told us
the deal is there to be done. I am

1081
00:46:10.345 --> 00:46:11.720
the deal is there to be done. I am
prepared to take them at their word

1082
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.345
prepared to take them at their word
and maybe the deal will be done, and

1083
00:46:13.345 --> 00:46:16.637
and maybe the deal will be done, and
I hope it will, but I know that the

1084
00:46:16.637 --> 00:46:18.970
I hope it will, but I know that the
industry, the haulage industry, the

1085
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.554
industry, the haulage industry, the
logistics industries, are very

1086
00:46:21.554 --> 00:46:23.137
logistics industries, are very
worried about what will happen. But

1087
00:46:23.137 --> 00:46:25.012
worried about what will happen. But
I would say we need to get the deal,

1088
00:46:25.012 --> 00:46:26.304
I would say we need to get the deal,
the Government need to do what they

1089
00:46:26.304 --> 00:46:27.804
the Government need to do what they
said they would do, support

1090
00:46:27.804 --> 00:46:28.887
said they would do, support
businesses through Covid, as they

1091
00:46:28.887 --> 00:46:30.512
businesses through Covid, as they
said they would, then we need to

1092
00:46:30.512 --> 00:46:31.845
said they would, then we need to
look beyond, and actually what kind

1093
00:46:31.845 --> 00:46:33.595
look beyond, and actually what kind
of country are we going to build?

1094
00:46:33.595 --> 00:46:37.345
of country are we going to build?
How are we going to build an economy

1095
00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:39.970
How are we going to build an economy
next year, that will take more than

1096
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:42.137
next year, that will take more than
Rishi Sunak in a fancy cashmere

1097
00:46:42.137 --> 00:46:45.387
Rishi Sunak in a fancy cashmere
sweater telling us he is going to

1098
00:46:45.387 --> 00:46:46.637
sweater telling us he is going to
freeze public sector pay. Do you

1099
00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.595
freeze public sector pay. Do you
know what I mean? We need a plan for

1100
00:46:48.595 --> 00:46:54.720
know what I mean? We need a plan for
what is the strategy...

1101
00:46:56.304 --> 00:46:58.887
Are you saying you would have
preferred to negotiate is to have

1102
00:46:58.887 --> 00:47:00.429
preferred to negotiate is to have
given an early and not by the

1103
00:47:00.429 --> 00:47:00.679
given an earty and not by the
British

1104
00:47:00.679 --> 00:47:03.929
given an early and not by the
British interest? I would have

1105
00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:04.137
British interest? Iwould have
preferred

1106
00:47:04.137 --> 00:47:05.345
British interest? I would have
preferred the Prime Minister to be

1107
00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:06.762
preferred the Prime Minister to be
correct when he said he would get

1108
00:47:06.762 --> 00:47:07.512
correct when he said he would get
the deal done in

1109
00:47:07.512 --> 00:47:08.345
correct when he said he would get
the deal done inJuly, which is what

1110
00:47:08.345 --> 00:47:09.720
the deal done in july, which is what
he promised.

1111
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.595
the deal done inJuly, which is what
he promised. He didn’t. He was

1112
00:47:10.595 --> 00:47:13.304
he promised. He didn’t. He was
confident the deal was off and ready

1113
00:47:13.304 --> 00:47:15.720
confident the deal was off and ready
in December. We haven’t seen it, and

1114
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.929
in December. We haven’t seen it, and
there are businesses... If you are

1115
00:47:17.929 --> 00:47:19.762
there are businesses... If you are
in manufacturing now, how can you

1116
00:47:19.762 --> 00:47:19.887
in manufacturing now, how ran you
encourage

1117
00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:20.679
in manufacturing now, how can you
encourage investment abroad when you

1118
00:47:20.679 --> 00:47:22.262
encourage investment abroad when you
don’t even know whether you are

1119
00:47:22.262 --> 00:47:24.679
don’t even know whether you are
going to be under a tariff regime in

1120
00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:26.887
going to be under a tariff regime in
a few weeks? If you are a farmer,

1121
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:27.387
a few weeks? If you are a farmer,
how ran you

1122
00:47:27.387 --> 00:47:28.554
a few weeks? If you are a farmer,
how can you plan for the future if

1123
00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:29.262
how ran you plan for the future if
you don’t know

1124
00:47:29.262 --> 00:47:30.179
how can you plan for the future if
you don’t know what the terrorist

1125
00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:32.179
you don’t know what the terrorist
regime is going to be? A look at our

1126
00:47:32.179 --> 00:47:35.345
regime is going to be? A look at our
financial services already decided

1127
00:47:35.345 --> 00:47:36.387
financial services already decided
to go elsewhere, because this

1128
00:47:36.387 --> 00:47:37.804
to go elsewhere, because this
uncertainty has meant people had no

1129
00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:39.429
uncertainty has meant people had no
idea what is ahead, and that is bad

1130
00:47:39.429 --> 00:47:42.054
idea what is ahead, and that is bad
management. It is an active

1131
00:47:42.054 --> 00:47:46.179
management. It is an active
negotiation. Peter. I

1132
00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:46.429
management. It is an active
negotiation. Peter. Ithink

1133
00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:46.845
management. It is an active
negotiation. Peter. I think it is

1134
00:47:46.845 --> 00:47:50.804
negotiation. Peter. I think it is
desperately important that there is

1135
00:47:50.804 --> 00:47:51.595
desperately important that there is
attention paid to scientific

1136
00:47:51.595 --> 00:47:52.804
attention paid to scientific
collaboration in this negotiation

1137
00:47:52.804 --> 00:47:55.220
collaboration in this negotiation
over Brexit. We know that the

1138
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.054
over Brexit. We know that the
collaborations we have had over the

1139
00:47:57.054 --> 00:48:00.387
collaborations we have had over the
past few decades within the EU have

1140
00:48:00.387 --> 00:48:03.429
past few decades within the EU have
been absolutely vital in driving

1141
00:48:03.429 --> 00:48:04.887
been absolutely vital in driving
science, and that is the way science

1142
00:48:04.887 --> 00:48:06.720
science, and that is the way science
is going. It is very collaborative

1143
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.304
is going. It is very collaborative
and international top we have

1144
00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:11.220
and international top we have
benefited hugely from the European

1145
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:16.220
benefited hugely from the European
funding system where every thing we

1146
00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.970
funding system where every thing we
get in, we get 8.6 million back, so

1147
00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.095
get in, we get 8.6 million back, so
this is a very important point for

1148
00:48:21.095 --> 00:48:24.970
this is a very important point for
UK universities and science, but we

1149
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.845
UK universities and science, but we
get a really good deal in terms of

1150
00:48:26.845 --> 00:48:28.137
get a really good deal in terms of
being still able to continue that

1151
00:48:28.137 --> 00:48:33.304
being still able to continue that
collaboration. We have a withdrawal

1152
00:48:33.304 --> 00:48:34.512
collaboration. We have a withdrawal
agreement. What we are going after

1153
00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:35.054
agreement. what we are going after
is a free

1154
00:48:35.054 --> 00:48:35.929
agreement. What we are going after
is a free trade agreement so we

1155
00:48:35.929 --> 00:48:39.887
is a free trade agreement so we
don’t trade on WTO terms and, if we

1156
00:48:39.887 --> 00:48:41.512
don’t trade on WTO terms and, if we
do, there will be tariffs that are

1157
00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:42.929
do, there will be tariffs that are
low on most sectors but quite high

1158
00:48:42.929 --> 00:48:46.262
low on most sectors but quite high
on some others. Maybe the money we

1159
00:48:46.262 --> 00:48:49.012
on some others. Maybe the money we
get back from Brussels, not spending

1160
00:48:49.012 --> 00:48:51.554
get back from Brussels, not spending
£10 billion a year, can be used to

1161
00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:51.720
£10 billion a year, ran be used to
subsidise

1162
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.762
£10 billion a year, can be used to
subsidise some of the sectors that

1163
00:48:52.762 --> 00:48:54.470
subsidise some of the sectors that
will suffer under higher tariffs if

1164
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:55.929
will suffer under higher tariffs if
there isn’t a free trade agreement.

1165
00:48:55.929 --> 00:48:58.345
there isn’t a free trade agreement.
I think there will be in the end,

1166
00:48:58.345 --> 00:49:00.137
I think there will be in the end,
because it makes sense, the EU has a

1167
00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:01.512
because it makes sense, the EU has a
trade deficit with us of almost £100

1168
00:49:01.512 --> 00:49:04.804
trade deficit with us of almost £100
billion. That is hundreds of

1169
00:49:04.804 --> 00:49:05.387
billion. That is hundreds of
thousands of

1170
00:49:05.387 --> 00:49:06.470
billion. That is hundreds of
thousands ofjobs in Germany and

1171
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.929
thousands ofjobs in Germany and
France, so

1172
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:07.762
thousands ofjobs in Germany and
France, sol

1173
00:49:07.762 --> 00:49:09.095
thousands ofjobs in Germany and
France, so I think the European

1174
00:49:09.095 --> 00:49:11.304
France, so I think the European
Union once a deal, but I share

1175
00:49:11.304 --> 00:49:13.095
Union once a deal, but I share
Alex’s frustration because, on the

1176
00:49:13.095 --> 00:49:13.179
Alex’s fmstration because, on the
surface,

1177
00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:14.262
Alex’s frustration because, on the
surface, fishing is a very small

1178
00:49:14.262 --> 00:49:18.720
surface, fishing is a very small
percentage of the Apollo me —— the

1179
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.095
percentage of the Apollo me -- the
economy, and

1180
00:49:19.095 --> 00:49:20.304
percentage of the Apollo me —— the
economy, and even smaller percentage

1181
00:49:20.304 --> 00:49:21.929
economy, and even smaller percentage
of the French economy, at Macon is a

1182
00:49:21.929 --> 00:49:24.095
of the French economy, at Macon is a
fight on his hands in the next

1183
00:49:24.095 --> 00:49:24.429
fight on his hands in the next
election, not

1184
00:49:24.429 --> 00:49:25.262
fight on his hands in the next
election, notjust from Marine Le

1185
00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.720
election, not just from Marine Le
Pen but

1186
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.679
election, notjust from Marine Le
Pen but also the fishermen and

1187
00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:30.012
Pen but also the fishermen and
politicians representing them in

1188
00:49:30.012 --> 00:49:31.387
politicians representing them in
northern France. But look at what we

1189
00:49:31.387 --> 00:49:32.929
northern France. But look at what we
are considering and who is being

1190
00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:35.720
are considering and who is being
reasonable for I study these issues

1191
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.887
reasonable for I study these issues
closely, and it’s always the Brits

1192
00:49:39.887 --> 00:49:41.929
closely, and it’s always the Brits
by our own media that are presented

1193
00:49:41.929 --> 00:49:42.929
by our own media that are presented
as being unreasonable at the

1194
00:49:42.929 --> 00:49:43.720
as being unreasonable at the
Europeans presented as being

1195
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.345
Europeans presented as being
sanguine. You are part of that

1196
00:49:46.345 --> 00:49:51.845
sanguine. You are part of that
media. I am a freelance journalist.

1197
00:49:51.845 --> 00:49:52.970
media. I am a freelance journalist.
The Common Fisheries Policy is not

1198
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:56.554
The Common Fisheries Policy is not
in the Treaty of Rome which founded

1199
00:49:56.554 --> 00:49:58.887
in the Treaty of Rome which founded
the EU. It was cobbled together

1200
00:49:58.887 --> 00:50:00.512
the EU. It was cobbled together
quickly as Britain was entering in

1201
00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:03.012
quickly as Britain was entering in
1973 and for the cost of a lunch

1202
00:50:03.012 --> 00:50:04.262
1973 and for the cost of a lunch
with George Pompidou Edward Heath at

1203
00:50:04.262 --> 00:50:05.887
with George Pompidou Edward Heath at
the last minute set, yeah, you can

1204
00:50:05.887 --> 00:50:07.637
the last minute set, yeah, you ran
enter our fishing

1205
00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.262
the last minute set, yeah, you can
enter our fishing waters, so we know

1206
00:50:09.262 --> 00:50:11.095
enter our fishing waters, so we know
we have a situation where two thirds

1207
00:50:11.095 --> 00:50:12.387
we have a situation where two thirds
of fish caught in British waters are

1208
00:50:12.387 --> 00:50:16.304
of fish caught in British waters are
by non—British boats. 90% of the cod

1209
00:50:16.304 --> 00:50:16.887
by non-British boats. 9096 of the cod
taught in the

1210
00:50:16.887 --> 00:50:17.595
by non—British boats. 90% of the cod
caught in the English Channel is cut

1211
00:50:17.595 --> 00:50:18.012
taught in the English Channel is cut
by French

1212
00:50:18.012 --> 00:50:18.804
caught in the English Channel is cut
by French boats. That can’t be

1213
00:50:18.804 --> 00:50:23.720
by French boats. That can’t be
right. This is a kind of colonial

1214
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.387
right. This is a kind of colonial
relationship, where some independent

1215
00:50:24.387 --> 00:50:25.720
relationship, where some independent
countries have a hold over the

1216
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.512
countries have a hold over the
resources of another now sovereign

1217
00:50:27.512 --> 00:50:29.845
resources of another now sovereign
independent country of stop the

1218
00:50:29.845 --> 00:50:32.720
independent country of stop the
reason fishing is such a small

1219
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.470
reason fishing is such a small
proportion of our economy is because

1220
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.887
proportion of our economy is because
it’s been decimated, and that is in

1221
00:50:35.887 --> 00:50:40.720
it’s been decimated, and that is in
poorest parts of the company. Over

1222
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.137
poorest parts of the company. Over
SON: of

1223
00:50:41.137 --> 00:50:42.095
poorest parts of the company. Over
50% of the English fishing quota has

1224
00:50:42.095 --> 00:50:42.512
5096 of the English fishing quota has
been to

1225
00:50:42.512 --> 00:50:45.554
50% of the English fishing quota has
been to foreign countries. Because

1226
00:50:45.554 --> 00:50:47.429
been to foreign countries. Because
our industry can’t get an economic

1227
00:50:47.429 --> 00:50:48.595
our industry can’t get an economic
foothold because it has been so

1228
00:50:48.595 --> 00:50:51.262
foothold because it has been so
marginalised. By the way, lots of my

1229
00:50:51.262 --> 00:50:53.887
marginalised. By the way, lots of my
friends in the Green Party for many

1230
00:50:53.887 --> 00:50:54.887
friends in the Green Party for many
years were against the Common

1231
00:50:54.887 --> 00:50:57.012
years were against the Common
Fisheries Policy because it has led

1232
00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:59.054
Fisheries Policy because it has led
to overfishing. If we had a British

1233
00:50:59.054 --> 00:51:00.054
to overfishing. If we had a British
fishing policy, we could allow

1234
00:51:00.054 --> 00:51:02.262
fishing policy, we could allow
stocks to replenish in our British

1235
00:51:02.262 --> 00:51:04.637
stocks to replenish in our British
waters. why

1236
00:51:04.637 --> 00:51:05.679
stocks to replenish in our British
waters. Why can’t we have the same

1237
00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:06.054
waters. why can’t we have the same
deal that

1238
00:51:06.054 --> 00:51:09.470
waters. Why can’t we have the same
deal that the Norwegians have?

1239
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.429
deal that the Norwegians have?
That’s why they didn’t

1240
00:51:10.429 --> 00:51:10.929
deal that the Norwegians have?
That’s why they didn’tjoin the

1241
00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:11.137
That’s why they didn’t join the
European

1242
00:51:11.137 --> 00:51:13.887
That’s why they didn’tjoin the
European Economic Community in 1973

1243
00:51:13.887 --> 00:51:15.054
European Economic Community in 1973

this often ready deal we were

1253
00:51:24.804 --> 00:51:29.679
this often ready deal we were
promised as another example of an

1254
00:51:29.679 --> 00:51:30.595
promised as another example of an
election promise that hasn’t been

1255
00:51:30.595 --> 00:51:31.179
election promise that hasn’t been
met, and I

1256
00:51:31.179 --> 00:51:33.762
election promise that hasn’t been
met, and Ijust wanted to ask, when

1257
00:51:33.762 --> 00:51:36.137
met, and Ijust wanted to ask, when
our our elected politicians and

1258
00:51:36.137 --> 00:51:37.179
our our elected politicians and
leaders don’t actually start taking

1259
00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:41.720
leaders don’t actually start taking
more accountability for a number of

1260
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.887
more accountability for a number of
promises that have been broken over

1261
00:51:42.887 --> 00:51:46.679
promises that have been broken over
the years? The oven ready deal was

1262
00:51:46.679 --> 00:51:47.804
the years? The oven ready deal was
in reference to the withdrawal

1263
00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:54.262
in reference to the withdrawal
agreement. Matthew. Yes, if we take

1264
00:51:54.262 --> 00:51:56.804
agreement. Matthew. Yes, if we take
back our waters, how are we going to

1265
00:51:56.804 --> 00:52:01.054
back our waters, how are we going to
police them. Michelle, do you have a

1266
00:52:01.054 --> 00:52:05.804
police them. Michelle, do you have a
view on that? This is about taking

1267
00:52:05.804 --> 00:52:07.179
view on that? This is about taking
back control not

1268
00:52:07.179 --> 00:52:08.262
view on that? This is about taking
back control notjust of our waters,

1269
00:52:08.262 --> 00:52:09.095
back control not just of our waters,
as we said

1270
00:52:09.095 --> 00:52:09.887
back control notjust of our waters,
as we said in the referendum, but

1271
00:52:09.887 --> 00:52:11.512
as we said in the referendum, but
also our laws, our borders, and our

1272
00:52:11.512 --> 00:52:15.054
also our laws, our borders, and our
money. Matthew was asking about

1273
00:52:15.054 --> 00:52:19.095
money. Matthew was asking about
policing it. This is about the

1274
00:52:19.095 --> 00:52:21.095
policing it. This is about the
agreement we have. I don’t think we

1275
00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.720
agreement we have. I don’t think we
are anticipating, if we enter

1276
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.429
are anticipating, if we enter
agreements with other countries,

1277
00:52:23.429 --> 00:52:24.929
agreements with other countries,
suddenly they are not going to be

1278
00:52:24.929 --> 00:52:28.845
suddenly they are not going to be
respected en masse. We did have cod

1279
00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:30.012
respected en masse. We did have cod
was before so it wouldn’t be

1280
00:52:30.012 --> 00:52:34.595
was before so it wouldn’t be
unprecedented. From hospitality

1281
00:52:34.595 --> 00:52:35.887
unprecedented. From hospitality
industry that needs Brexit, a deal

1282
00:52:35.887 --> 00:52:37.887
industry that needs Brexit, a deal
to come through as soon as possible,

1283
00:52:37.887 --> 00:52:40.637
to come through as soon as possible,
solely for the foundation of

1284
00:52:40.637 --> 00:52:41.887
solely for the foundation of
understanding where we are, it’s the

1285
00:52:41.887 --> 00:52:43.179
understanding where we are, it’s the
uncertainty of being able to move

1286
00:52:43.179 --> 00:52:44.095
uncertainty of being able to move
forward. Time is running out

1287
00:52:44.095 --> 00:52:46.845
forward. Time is mnning out
quickly.

1288
00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:47.429
forward. Time is running out
quickly. Personally speaking, any

1289
00:52:47.429 --> 00:52:49.095
quickly. Personally speaking, any
deal is going to be better than no

1290
00:52:49.095 --> 00:52:53.595
deal is going to be better than no

1291
00:52:53.595 --> 00:52:55.387
deal. The way that prices are going
to rise, the uncertainty of the

1292
00:52:55.387 --> 00:52:56.887
to rise, the uncertainty of the
market, we are not a self—sufficient

1293
00:52:56.887 --> 00:53:01.220
market, we are not a self-sufficient
country. We

1294
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.595
market, we are not a self—sufficient
country. We export... We only

1295
00:53:03.595 --> 00:53:04.012
country. We export... We only
produced 7096

1296
00:53:04.012 --> 00:53:05.179
country. We export... We only
produced 70% of the meat we need in

1297
00:53:05.179 --> 00:53:05.720
produced 7096 of the meat we need in
this country. We

1298
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.845
produced 70% of the meat we need in
this country. We import at least

1299
00:53:06.845 --> 00:53:09.845
this country. We import at least
30%. Trade tariffs need to be sorted

1300
00:53:09.845 --> 00:53:11.179
3096. Trade tariffs need to be sorted
out the top

1301
00:53:11.179 --> 00:53:12.970
30%. Trade tariffs need to be sorted
out the top there is so much and

1302
00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:13.512
out the top there is so much and
time is mnning

1303
00:53:13.512 --> 00:53:14.512
out the top there is so much and
time is running out so rapidly as we

1304
00:53:14.512 --> 00:53:16.304
time is mnning out so rapidly as we
get to the end of

1305
00:53:16.304 --> 00:53:17.054
time is running out so rapidly as we
get to the end of Covid—19 we are

1306
00:53:17.054 --> 00:53:17.387
get to the end of Covid-19 we are
then at

1307
00:53:17.387 --> 00:53:18.429
get to the end of Covid—19 we are
then at the point of this Brexit,

1308
00:53:18.429 --> 00:53:23.804
then at the point of this Brexit,
and hospitality is set there with

1309
00:53:23.804 --> 00:53:24.012
and hospitality is sat there with
all

1310
00:53:24.012 --> 00:53:25.220
and hospitality is set there with
all those precious it is put under,

1311
00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:29.179
all those precious it is put under,
so much that hospitality can bring

1312
00:53:29.179 --> 00:53:29.595
so much that hospitality ran bring
to the

1313
00:53:29.595 --> 00:53:30.429
so much that hospitality can bring
to the forefront of regenerating, of

1314
00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:32.387
to the forefront of regenerating, of
being part of the high street. We

1315
00:53:32.387 --> 00:53:33.554
being part of the high street. We
talk about high street and retail

1316
00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:38.429
talk about high street and retail
being in trouble, and a retail

1317
00:53:38.429 --> 00:53:40.012
being in trouble, and a retail
experience generating movement,

1318
00:53:40.012 --> 00:53:40.220
experience generating movement,
rash,

1319
00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.887
experience generating movement,
cash, everything flowing, without

1320
00:53:40.887 --> 00:53:40.970
rash, everything ﬂowing, without
hospitality

1321
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.012
cash, everything flowing, without
hospitality being a part of that why

1322
00:53:43.012 --> 00:53:44.929
hospitality being a part of that why
then would you go to the high

1323
00:53:44.929 --> 00:53:46.512
then would you go to the high
street? How do we move things

1324
00:53:46.512 --> 00:53:47.720
street? How do we move things
forward? We need a solid foundation.

1325
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.720
forward? We need a solid foundation.
We need Brexit deals decided, we

1326
00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.220
We need Brexit deals decided, we
need to be able to move forward, we

1327
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.262
need to be able to move forward, we
need to future proof how we can

1328
00:53:55.262 --> 00:53:55.470
need to future proof how we ran
build

1329
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.095
need to future proof how we can
build forward through the

1330
00:53:56.095 --> 00:53:57.804
build forward through the
hospitality industry which is the

1331
00:53:57.804 --> 00:53:58.012
hospitality industry which is the
heating

1332
00:53:58.012 --> 00:53:58.845
hospitality industry which is the
beating heart and soul of

1333
00:53:58.845 --> 00:54:01.220
beating heart and soul of
communities. That is what we are

1334
00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.845
communities. That is what we are
forgetting when we talk about the

1335
00:54:03.845 --> 00:54:05.887
forgetting when we talk about the
offers that we put in. It’s not

1336
00:54:05.887 --> 00:54:06.470
forgetting when we talk about the
offers that we put in. It’s notjust

1337
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.679
offers that we put in. It’s not just
about

1338
00:54:06.679 --> 00:54:07.595
offers that we put in. It’s notjust
about what we sell. We don’t

1339
00:54:07.595 --> 00:54:07.804
offers that we put in. It’s notjust
about what we sell. We don’tjust

1340
00:54:07.804 --> 00:54:08.262
about what we sell. We don’t just
sell food

1341
00:54:08.262 --> 00:54:09.262
about what we sell. We don’tjust
sell food and drink. We give the

1342
00:54:09.262 --> 00:54:13.929
sell food and drink. We give the
fabric of society... It is

1343
00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:15.470
fabric of society... It is
intertwined with meeting up, being a

1344
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.262
intertwined with meeting up, being a
part of it, and that needs the

1345
00:54:17.262 --> 00:54:18.637
part of it, and that needs the
foundation for us as a country, no

1346
00:54:18.637 --> 00:54:20.345
foundation for us as a country, no
matter what business it is. We don’t

1347
00:54:20.345 --> 00:54:24.179
matter what business it is. We don’t
have much what —— time but I want to

1348
00:54:24.179 --> 00:54:24.762
have much what -- time but I want to
get one more

1349
00:54:24.762 --> 00:54:25.595
have much what —— time but I want to
get one more question him from them

1350
00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:30.429
get one more question him from them
26. Due to the Covid crisis,

1351
00:54:30.429 --> 00:54:30.512
26. Due to the Covid crisis,
in-person

1352
00:54:30.512 --> 00:54:31.054
26. Due to the Covid crisis,
in—person teaching across

1353
00:54:31.054 --> 00:54:33.179
in—person teaching across
universities has been dire. For some

1354
00:54:33.179 --> 00:54:34.220
universities has been dire. For some
students they only received two

1355
00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:40.512
students they only received two
hours a week. Equating to roughly

1356
00:54:40.512 --> 00:54:41.470
hours a week. Equating to roughly
£289 per in—person session this

1357
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.720
£289 per in—person session this
semester. How can you possibly

1358
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.637
semester. How ran you possibly
justify

1359
00:54:45.637 --> 00:54:46.595
semester. How can you possibly
justify charging this amount,

1360
00:54:46.595 --> 00:54:47.554
justify charging this amount,
especially to those in lower

1361
00:54:47.554 --> 00:54:50.637
especially to those in lower
socioeconomic brackets? I’m assuming

socioeconomic brackets? I’m assuming

tension that is become prevalent
that Covid isn’t going anywhere, but

1377
00:55:12.887 --> 00:55:14.929
that Covid isn’t going anywhere, but
the management within many

1378
00:55:14.929 --> 00:55:15.720
the management within many
universities has been rather

1379
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.262
universities has been rather
abysmal, in my opinion first up we

1380
00:55:18.262 --> 00:55:20.179
abysmal, in my opinion first up we
haven’t received the education we

1381
00:55:20.179 --> 00:55:21.887
haven’t received the education we
have been promised. We haven’t

1382
00:55:21.887 --> 00:55:23.512
have been promised. We haven’t
received the resources we have been

1383
00:55:23.512 --> 00:55:24.720
received the resources we have been
promised. Everything has been put on

1384
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.887
promised. Everything has been put on
hold. It’s rather worrying that I’m

1385
00:55:26.887 --> 00:55:28.345
hold. It’s rather worrying that I’m
still paying obscene fees for

1386
00:55:28.345 --> 00:55:32.429
still paying obscene fees for
minimal education. We only have five

1387
00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:33.887
minimal education. We only have five
minutes, so I’m going to go around

1388
00:55:33.887 --> 00:55:38.804
minutes, so I’m going to go around
quickly. Liam. I have too school—age

1389
00:55:38.804 --> 00:55:39.929
quickly. Liam. I have too school-age
children, one

1390
00:55:39.929 --> 00:55:42.762
quickly. Liam. I have too school—age
children, one at university, but my

1391
00:55:42.762 --> 00:55:43.845
children, one at university, but my
heart breaks for young people.

1392
00:55:43.845 --> 00:55:44.387
heart breaks for young peopla.
That’s why I

1393
00:55:44.387 --> 00:55:45.929
heart breaks for young people.
That’s why I wanted to see more age

1394
00:55:45.929 --> 00:55:48.804
That’s why I wanted to see more age
stratified lockdown, and older

1395
00:55:48.804 --> 00:55:48.970
stratified lockdown, and older
lacturers,

1396
00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:53.137
stratified lockdown, and older
lecturers, older teachers who are

1397
00:55:53.137 --> 00:55:53.304
lacturers, older teachers who are
vulnerabla,

1398
00:55:53.304 --> 00:55:53.887
lecturers, older teachers who are
vulnerable, have pre—existing

1399
00:55:53.887 --> 00:55:55.262
vulnerable, have pre—existing
conditions, of course they can

1400
00:55:55.262 --> 00:55:55.470
conditions, of course they ran
shield

1401
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.262
conditions, of course they can
shield and be financially supported

1402
00:55:56.262 --> 00:55:58.095
shield and be financially supported
when they are shielding, but I think

1403
00:55:58.095 --> 00:56:00.220
when they are shielding, but I think
we have been far too quick to close

1404
00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.804
we have been far too quick to close
down schools and, for the most part,

1405
00:56:03.804 --> 00:56:05.512
down schools and, for the most part,
universities. For me, it sticks in

1406
00:56:05.512 --> 00:56:06.429
universities. For me, it sticks in
the craw, and

1407
00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.179
universities. For me, it sticks in
the crew, and I’d like to see

1408
00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:08.387
the crew, and I’d like to see
universities refunding students at

1409
00:56:08.387 --> 00:56:09.804
universities refunding students at
this part of the fees they are

1410
00:56:09.804 --> 00:56:12.179
this part of the fees they are
paying-

1411
00:56:12.179 --> 00:56:13.054
this part of the fees they are
paying, particularly as we have

1412
00:56:13.054 --> 00:56:13.220
paying, particularty as we have
heard

1413
00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:13.845
paying, particularly as we have
heard students from lower

1414
00:56:13.845 --> 00:56:18.845
heard students from lower
socioeconomic groups. Peter. Crib

1415
00:56:18.845 --> 00:56:20.220
socioeconomic groups. Peter. Crib
it’s been incredibly tough year not

1416
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.637
it’s been incredibly tough year not
just for students but for staff. My

1417
00:56:23.637 --> 00:56:24.637
just for students but for staff. My
colleagues at imperial have been

1418
00:56:24.637 --> 00:56:26.179
colleagues at imperial have been
working day and night to try and

1419
00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:32.220
working day and night to try and
make it possible to teach safely. I

1420
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.179
make it possible to teach safely. I
must say, many universities have

1421
00:56:33.179 --> 00:56:36.429
must say, many universities have
succeeded well. There have been very

1422
00:56:36.429 --> 00:56:37.429
succeeded well. There have been very
few in—class transmissions of the

1423
00:56:37.429 --> 00:56:39.054
few in-dass transmissions of the
virus, and

1424
00:56:39.054 --> 00:56:40.220
few in—class transmissions of the
virus, and there has been quite a

1425
00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.887
virus, and there has been quite a
lot of transmission, but that’s

1426
00:56:42.887 --> 00:56:44.095
lot of transmission, but that’s
mostly due to students being very

1427
00:56:44.095 --> 00:56:45.845
mostly due to students being very
social, which is after all why they

1428
00:56:45.845 --> 00:56:47.470
social, which is after all why they
want to come to university. I think

1429
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:51.637
want to come to university. I think
it is patchy, but

1430
00:56:51.637 --> 00:56:51.929
want to come to university. I think
it is patchy, butl

1431
00:56:51.929 --> 00:56:52.512
want to come to university. I think
it is patchy, but I do want to

1432
00:56:52.512 --> 00:56:53.470
it is patchy, but I do want to
acknowledge the huge efforts that

1433
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:58.137
acknowledge the huge efforts that
have been put in by many people at

1434
00:56:58.137 --> 00:56:59.220
have been put in by many people at
universities and by hugely dedicated

1435
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.429
universities and by hugely dedicated
people trying to deliver teaching

1436
00:57:00.429 --> 00:57:02.637
people trying to deliver teaching
under very difficult circumstances.

1437
00:57:02.637 --> 00:57:06.470
under very difficult circumstances.
The question is about the amount she

1438
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:07.429
The question is about the amount she
has been charged, and George

1439
00:57:07.429 --> 00:57:08.470
has been charged, and George
obviously feels she’s been

1440
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:09.470
obviously feels she’s been
short—changed in terms of the

1441
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.845
short-changed in terms of the
teaching she

1442
00:57:09.845 --> 00:57:14.054
short—changed in terms of the
teaching she is getting. It’s really

1443
00:57:14.054 --> 00:57:15.262
teaching she is getting. It’s really
difficult and I sympathise. I know

1444
00:57:15.262 --> 00:57:16.470
difficult and I sympathise. I know
some repayment has been made from

1445
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.054
some repayment has been made from
Manchester University, is it? You

1446
00:57:18.054 --> 00:57:22.095
Manchester University, is it? You
will know better. Is for

1447
00:57:22.095 --> 00:57:26.179
will know better. Is for
accommodation, not teaching. I think

1448
00:57:26.179 --> 00:57:26.345
accommodation, not teaching. Ithink
other

1449
00:57:26.345 --> 00:57:27.179
accommodation, not teaching. I think
other universities are looking at

1450
00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:28.387
other universities are looking at
that and I think the government

1451
00:57:28.387 --> 00:57:30.054
that and I think the government
should also look and see if there is

1452
00:57:30.054 --> 00:57:32.220
should also look and see if there is
support they can give, the key is to

1453
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:32.595
support they ran give, the key is to
be that

1454
00:57:32.595 --> 00:57:33.970
support they can give, the key is to
be that we cracked this thing and

1455
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:35.887
be that we cracked this thing and
make sure we come back to normal as

1456
00:57:35.887 --> 00:57:37.137
make sure we come back to normal as
quickly as possible so everybody has

1457
00:57:37.137 --> 00:57:37.262
quickly as possibla so everybody has
to

1458
00:57:37.262 --> 00:57:39.470
quickly as possible so everybody has
to adhere to the rules, we have to

1459
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.845
to adhere to the mles, we have to
improve Test

1460
00:57:39.845 --> 00:57:43.012
to adhere to the rules, we have to
improve Test and Trace. Korea do you

1461
00:57:43.012 --> 00:57:43.970
improve Test and Trace. Korea do you
think students should be reimbursed

1462
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.804
think students should be reimbursed
for their teaching? We have to look

1463
00:57:45.804 --> 00:57:49.429
for their teaching? We have to look
at it. There will be lots of

1464
00:57:49.429 --> 00:57:51.012
at it. There will be lots of
different experiences depending on

1465
00:57:51.012 --> 00:57:52.262
different experiences depending on
what university and subject you do.

1466
00:57:52.262 --> 00:57:53.595
what university and subject you do.
I think the governor should look at

1467
00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:56.887
I think the governor should look at
it. I did 2 degrees and most people

1468
00:57:56.887 --> 00:57:58.470
it. I did 2 degrees and most people
told me were under 44 top bike and

1469
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:01.887
told me were under 44 top bike and
that kind of teaching carry on? Been

1470
00:58:01.887 --> 00:58:05.095
that kind of teaching carry on? Been
a student is an incredibly expensive

1471
00:58:05.095 --> 00:58:06.970
a student is an incredibly expensive
thing these days and come up with a

1472
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.970
thing these days and come up with a
lot of debt... It’s not

1473
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:09.595
thing these days and come up with a
lot of debt... It’s notjust been a

1474
00:58:09.595 --> 00:58:09.970
lot of debt... It’s not just been a
student, that

1475
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:11.179
lot of debt... It’s notjust been a
student, that whole point, if you

1476
00:58:11.179 --> 00:58:12.262
student, that whola point, if you
are spending

1477
00:58:12.262 --> 00:58:13.179
student, that whole point, if you
are spending money on something and

1478
00:58:13.179 --> 00:58:14.804
are spending money on something and
expecting 100% back for it, but

1479
00:58:14.804 --> 00:58:15.179
expecting 10096 back for it, but
you’re not

1480
00:58:15.179 --> 00:58:16.554
expecting 100% back for it, but
you’re not getting it, you are only

1481
00:58:16.554 --> 00:58:18.012
you’re not getting it, you are only
getting 5096,

1482
00:58:18.012 --> 00:58:19.095
you’re not getting it, you are only
getting 50%, surely you want 50%

1483
00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:19.262
getting 5096, surely you want 5096
back.

1484
00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:21.679
getting 50%, surely you want 50%
back. Students should be getting

1485
00:58:21.679 --> 00:58:27.845
back. Students should be getting
their money back. This has been a

1486
00:58:27.845 --> 00:58:29.262
their money back. This has been a
really difficult time for students,

1487
00:58:29.262 --> 00:58:31.470
really difficult time for students,
and I totally empathise and try and

1488
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:33.387
and I totally empathise and try and
understand, having not been at

1489
00:58:33.387 --> 00:58:34.512
understand, having not been at
university during this time, I can

1490
00:58:34.512 --> 00:58:36.054
university during this time, I ran
only try and do

1491
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:36.970
university during this time, I can
only try and do that, because it has

1492
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.304
only try and do that, because it has
been really difficult, but we as a

1493
00:58:38.304 --> 00:58:42.554
been really difficult, but we as a
government set maximum tuition fees,

1494
00:58:42.554 --> 00:58:43.429
government set maximum tuition fees,
sorry, the minimum, and

1495
00:58:43.429 --> 00:58:45.095
sorry, the minimum, and
universities, if they want to charge

1496
00:58:45.095 --> 00:58:47.012
universities, if they want to charge
that maximum, we have been very

1497
00:58:47.012 --> 00:58:48.012
that maximum, we have been very
dear, they have

1498
00:58:48.012 --> 00:58:48.595
that maximum, we have been very
clear, they have to ensure the

1499
00:58:48.595 --> 00:58:49.220
dear, they have to ensure the
quality is

1500
00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.220
clear, they have to ensure the
quality is maintained and the

1501
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.679
quality is maintained and the
quantity is maintained and that that

1502
00:58:51.679 --> 00:58:53.595
quantity is maintained and that that
tuition is also accessible. If you

1503
00:58:53.595 --> 00:58:55.470
tuition is also accessible. If you
don’t think you have been getting

1504
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:57.595
don’t think you have been getting
that, I would urge you to make a

1505
00:58:57.595 --> 00:58:58.637
that, I would urge you to make a
formal complaint to your university.

1506
00:58:58.637 --> 00:59:01.762
formal complaint to your university.
There is a process in place. So you

1507
00:59:01.762 --> 00:59:03.304
There is a process in place. So you
think the university should pay up

1508
00:59:03.304 --> 00:59:05.554
think the university should pay up
if students can prove they haven’t

1509
00:59:05.554 --> 00:59:05.762
if students ran prove they haven’t
had

1510
00:59:05.762 --> 00:59:10.512
if students can prove they haven’t
had much teaching? There are amazing

1511
00:59:10.512 --> 00:59:11.679
had much teaching? There are amazing
examples of blended learning

1512
00:59:11.679 --> 00:59:13.179
examples of blended learning
working, where universities have

1513
00:59:13.179 --> 00:59:15.429
working, where universities have
gone above and beyond to produce

1514
00:59:15.429 --> 00:59:17.429
gone above and beyond to produce
innovative, dynamic learning, and

1515
00:59:17.429 --> 00:59:19.137
innovative, dynamic learning, and
it’s a success, it really is. Just

1516
00:59:19.137 --> 00:59:19.429
it’s a success, it really is. just
because

1517
00:59:19.429 --> 00:59:20.429
it’s a success, it really is. Just
because it’s online doesn’t have to

1518
00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:23.804
because it’s online doesn’t have to
mean it’s inferior. Are there some

1519
00:59:23.804 --> 00:59:25.887
mean it’s inferior. Are there some
students that feel dissatisfied and

1520
00:59:25.887 --> 00:59:26.845
students that feel dissatisfied and
like they haven’t got that?

1521
00:59:26.845 --> 00:59:28.095
like they haven’t got that?
Absolutely, and there is a process

1522
00:59:28.095 --> 00:59:30.970
Absolutely, and there is a process
in place for them. They can claim

1523
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:31.345
in place for them. They ran claim
from the

1524
00:59:31.345 --> 00:59:35.220
in place for them. They can claim
from the university and then go to

1525
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.345
from the university and then go to
the OIA, the independent

1526
00:59:36.345 --> 00:59:37.220
the OIA, the independent
adjudicator, and they potentially

1527
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:37.637
adjudicator, and they potentially
ran get

1528
00:59:37.637 --> 00:59:38.554
adjudicator, and they potentially
can get partial or full refund based

1529
00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:40.179
ran get partial or full refund based
on that.

1530
00:59:40.179 --> 00:59:45.470
can get partial or full refund based
on that. Have any students succeeded

1531
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.679
on that. Have any students succeeded
in that? In the past, with strikes,

1532
00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:48.845
in that? In the past, with strikes,
a number of students went through

1533
00:59:48.845 --> 00:59:51.220
a number of students went through
that process was there as a time—lag

1534
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:51.387
that process was there as a time-lag
because

1535
00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.179
that process was there as a time—lag
because of the university played

1536
00:59:52.179 --> 00:59:54.595
because of the university played
first. Nobody is denying it hasn’t

1537
00:59:54.595 --> 00:59:57.804
first. Nobody is denying it hasn’t
been difficult, of course it has.

1538
00:59:57.804 --> 00:59:59.220
been difficult, of course it has.
But a number of universities have

1539
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.262
But a number of universities have
really invested in that blended

1540
01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:04.929
really invested in that blended
learning model by totally —— but I

1541
01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:05.304
learning model by totally -- but I
take on

1542
01:00:05.304 --> 01:00:06.470
learning model by totally —— but I
take on board the comments tonight

1543
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:07.637
take on board the comments tonight
and I recognise the process that

1544
01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.220
and I recognise the process that
should be followed. Does that answer

1545
01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:16.637
should be followed. Does that answer
your question? Yeah, thank you.

1546
01:00:16.637 --> 01:00:19.054
your question? Yeah, thank you.

What’s Christmassy about this?

1595
01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:04.887
Well, there’s that bloke.

1596
01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.387
Ho—ho—ho!

1597
01:02:06.387 --> 01:02:07.595
I’m in Santa’s Village.

1598
01:02:07.595 --> 01:02:09.220
This really is Christmas for me.

1599
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.179
Does the power ever go to your head

1600
01:02:11.179 --> 01:02:12.970
about having
a good list and a bad list?

1601
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:14.595
I would say
the sense of isolation is

1602
01:02:14.595 --> 01:02:17.220
slightly undermined by the fact
there are 50 people up here.

1603
01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.304
Escape with the Christmas
Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan.

1604
01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:27.595
It’s Musicals Week
on Strictly Come Dancing.

1605
01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:32.304
# This is the greatest show

1606
01:02:32.304 --> 01:02:35.054
# Where it’s covered in all
the coloured lights

1607
01:02:35.054 --> 01:02:37.304
# Where the runaways
are running the night... #

1608
01:02:37.304 --> 01:02:38.595
Just beautiful.

1609
01:02:47.137 --> 01:02:49.512
The first time you ever doped,
how old were you?

1610
01:02:49.512 --> 01:02:52.595
Erm, ahem, wow,
straight into that, er...

1611
01:02:52.595 --> 01:02:54.554
It’s almost like a confessional.

1612
01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:58.054
They do need a chance to tell
someone what they went through.

1613
01:02:58.054 --> 01:03:01.595
We sowed the seeds of Isis
in 2003. We didn’t.

1614
01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.929
Morally, how does that sit with you?

1615
01:03:04.929 --> 01:03:07.137
It doesn’t fit. We must acquit.

1616
01:03:07.137 --> 01:03:08.845
There’s only one Rupert.

1617
01:03:08.845 --> 01:03:11.720
It’s kind of amazing
when you think about it.

1618
01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.387
It was a bit of a shock to me.

1619
01:03:13.387 --> 01:03:15.137
What happens next is up to

1620
01:03:15.137 --> 01:03:16.137
every one of us.

1621
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.637
Stories that haven’t been told.

1622
01:03:46.095 --> 01:03:49.429
So it seems like we might be
on the verge of a post—Brexit trade

1623
01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:51.804
and security partnership deal,
whatever you want to call it,

1624
01:03:51.804 --> 01:03:54.012
with the EU, so we’ve reassembled
the Brexitcast gang.

1625
01:03:54.012 --> 01:03:56.387
Laura’s here, Chris is here,
Dr Adler is in Brussels,

1626
01:03:56.387 --> 01:03:59.262
and we’ve invited back a guest who’s
been on a few times.

1627
01:03:59.262 --> 01:04:00.262
It’s Tony Blair.

1628
01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:01.345
Hello.

1629
01:04:01.345 --> 01:04:02.387
Hello.

1630
01:04:02.387 --> 01:04:04.804
Now, we are all obsessed
about The Crown, although obviously

1631
01:04:04.804 --> 01:04:07.179
as usual Chris Mason is four series
behind everyone else,

1632
01:04:07.179 --> 01:04:09.137
and everyone is obsessed
about Gillian Anderson playing

1633
01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.179
Margaret Thatcher.

1634
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.220
Have you been watching?

1635
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.095
Do you think Gillian Anderson got
Mrs T down to a tee?

1636
01:04:14.095 --> 01:04:15.137
I haven’t watched it.

1637
01:04:15.137 --> 01:04:20.137
0h, 0K.

1638
01:04:20.804 --> 01:04:21.804
SIGHS

1639
01:04:21.804 --> 01:04:23.720
Well, you are a busy
international man of

1640
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.804
jetsetting mystery now, so...

1641
01:04:24.804 --> 01:04:25.845
Not really.

1642
01:04:25.845 --> 01:04:27.012
I watch lots of things.

1643
01:04:27.012 --> 01:04:28.220
Ijust haven’t watched that.

1644
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:33.220
I know everyone’s fascinated by it
everywhere, but it’s not my...

1645
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.304
Because you don’t need to watch
a drama of an audience

1646
01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:38.720
with the Queen, because you just
remember the 200 that

1647
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.554
you actually had with her.

1648
01:04:40.554 --> 01:04:45.595
I actually never really
watch political...

1649
01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:50.679
Programmes that are sort
of political, because I know that

1650
01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:01.054
every time I’m watching them I am
always going to be thinking, "No,

1651
01:05:01.054 --> 01:05:03.429
that wouldn’t have happened," and it
would probably be that.

1652
01:05:03.429 --> 01:05:05.595
Have you never watched any
of the many dramatisations

1653
01:05:05.595 --> 01:05:06.637
of people playing you?

1654
01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:07.679
Absolutely not.

1655
01:05:07.679 --> 01:05:08.762
Not even Michael Sheen?!

1656
01:05:08.762 --> 01:05:09.762
Oh, come on!

1657
01:05:09.762 --> 01:05:10.804
I haven’t.

1658
01:05:10.804 --> 01:05:12.470
I’ve not seen The Queen,
for example.

1659
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:14.387
No, because Ijust know
what would happen.

1660
01:05:14.387 --> 01:05:16.304
It’s an experience that,
because I was there...

1661
01:05:16.304 --> 01:05:18.470
Well, I think it’s time
to reduce the budget,
