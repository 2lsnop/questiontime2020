00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:05.698
day today, a day that’s brought a
mixture of sunny spells and some

2
00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:06.115
mixture of sunny spells and some
fairty heavy

3
00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:06.948
mixture of sunny spells and some
fairly heavy showers. The showers

4
00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:07.115
fairty heavy showers. The showers
rotating

5
00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:08.782
fairly heavy showers. The showers
rotating around an area of low

6
00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:09.907
rotating around an area of low
pressure that’s moving across

7
00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:11.365
pressure that’s moving across
Scotland at the moment, but that’s

8
00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:15.115
Scotland at the moment, but that’s
not the last of the lows. Out in the

9
00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.990
not the last of the lows. Out in the
Atlantic two more swells of cloud,

10
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.407
Atlantic two more swells of cloud,
one coming in on Friday, one in time

11
00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:21.782
one coming in on Friday, one in time
for the weekend. We’ll see further

12
00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:23.365
for the weekend. We’ll see further
unsettled weather. Tonight we are

13
00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:25.698
unsettled weather. Tonight we are
going to continue to see showers,

14
00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:26.157
going to continue to see showers,
particularty

15
00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:26.740
going to continue to see showers,
particularly across northern areas.

16
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.323
particularty across northern areas.
A bit of

17
00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:29.365
particularly across northern areas.
A bit of snow in the hills of

18
00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:30.865
A bit of snow in the hills of
northern Scotland. Quite breezy for

19
00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.282
northern Scotland. Quite breezy for
most but we could see a nip of frost

20
00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.865
most but we could see a nip of frost
across northern parts to allow a few

21
00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:37.823
across northern parts to allow a few
icy stretches to develop. Tomorrow

22
00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:39.573
icy stretches to develop. Tomorrow
we will have cold winds coming down

23
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.823
we will have cold winds coming down
the North Sea bringing plenty of

24
00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:43.073
the North Sea bringing plenty of
showers from the word go, but for

25
00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:44.573
showers from the word go, but for
many of us that winds will be

26
00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:45.907
many of us that winds will be
lighter and there will be more

27
00:00:45.907 --> 00:00:48.365
lighter and there will be more
sunshine to go round. However, there

28
00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.365
sunshine to go round. However, there
will be rain approaching Wales and

29
00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.532
will be rain approaching Wales and
south—west England later in the day

30
00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:52.657
south-west England later in the day
and

31
00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:54.282
south—west England later in the day
and there will be a zone where we

32
00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:55.615
and there will be a zone where we
get the winds coming across Wales,

33
00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:55.740
get the winds coming across Walas,
bashing

34
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.240
get the winds coming across Wales,
bashing together with winds from the

35
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.907
bashing together with winds from the
North Sea. Not that the winds are

36
00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:00.865
North Sea. Not that the winds are
strong but they’ll bring this line

37
00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:01.073
strong but therll bring this line
of

38
00:01:01.073 --> 00:01:02.490
strong but they’ll bring this line
of moisture which will generate some

39
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.157
of moisture which will generate some
showers, stretching more or less

40
00:01:05.157 --> 00:01:05.282
showers, stretching more or lass
from

41
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:06.198
showers, stretching more or less
from Merseyside, across the Midlands

42
00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.907
from Merseyside, across the Midlands
and into the Greater London area.

43
00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:09.448
and into the Greater London area.
Some of the show is quite slow

44
00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:11.282
Some of the show is quite slow
moving and it could turn quite

45
00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:13.073
moving and it could turn quite
cloudy for a time. Rain across

46
00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.532
cloudy for a time. Rain across
western areas overnight and for the

47
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.323
western areas overnight and for the
weekend there’s going to be quite

48
00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:17.740
weekend there’s going to be quite
windy, rainy at times probably best

49
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.823
windy, rainy at times probably best
sums up the forecast, but the rain

50
00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:21.115
sums up the forecast, but the rain
could be quite heavy again

51
00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.698
Tonight, we’re in West Bromwich.

52
00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:03.823
Welcome to Question Time.

APPLAUSE.

67
00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:01.740
Welcome to our panel,
to the audience here and,

68
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.490
of course, you are at home.

69
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.448
Do join in the conversation,
you know how to do it now,

70
00:03:09.573 --> 00:03:10.782
on social media, @BBCQuestionTime.

71
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:12.948
Right, it’s been quite a day,
quite an afternoon,

72
00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:14.115
lots of news coming out.

73
00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:18.032
Let’s start, our first question,
with Matthew Grocott.

74
00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:20.657
Every European country seems to be
taking pro—active action in regards

75
00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:22.240
to the coronavirus pandemic.

76
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.198
Is our government doing enough?

77
00:03:27.198 --> 00:03:30.032
Steve, I’m going to start with you,
since you are the Cabinet

78
00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:31.115
Minister on the panel.

79
00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:33.240
BorisJohnson says this
is the worst public health

80
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.282
crisis for a generation.

81
00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:36.448
Many families will lose loved
ones before their time.

82
00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:37.657
Is the government doing enough?

83
00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:39.823
Sure, well, it’s a moment
of concern, I recognise,

84
00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.448
for many people and we will be
guided by the experts,

85
00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:44.198
by the science and by the facts.

86
00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:49.240
And that is very much in forming
the approach we are taking.

87
00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:52.115
We are being open within
government with that science,

88
00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:55.073
so the Chief Medical Officer
for England, Professor Witty,

89
00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:57.240
for England, Professor Whitty,

90
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.907
who is leading our response,
is in close contact with his

91
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:02.073
counterparts across
the United Kingdom.

92
00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:03.990
Across the political parties,
we are working constructively

93
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.365
together, meeting through the COBRA
system to coordinate our response

94
00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:08.948
and it’s right that our response
is calibrated to the needs

95
00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.365
of the United Kingdom.

96
00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:15.407
So it is the case, other countries
sometimes do things differently.

97
00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:20.407
For example, Italy was testing
passengers on flights to China,

98
00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:22.573
where there were questions
as to whether the UK

99
00:04:22.573 --> 00:04:24.657
should be doing the same.

100
00:04:24.657 --> 00:04:27.948
Can I ask you about Ireland tonight?

101
00:04:27.948 --> 00:04:32.907
We have this unusual situation now
where Leo Varadkar says their advice

102
00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:36.157
is that they should restrict mass
gatherings of more than 100

103
00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:38.907
people if it’s indoors,
500 people if it’s outdoors,

104
00:04:38.907 --> 00:04:42.157
so you’re going to have a situation
where, on one island,

105
00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.865
you’ve got one government
following their advice,

106
00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:47.948
which is very different and,
just over the border,

107
00:04:47.948 --> 00:04:50.407
people cross that border
all the time, in Northern Ireland.

108
00:04:50.407 --> 00:04:53.823
Yes and I think there is a specific
issue in terms of Northern Ireland,

109
00:04:53.823 --> 00:04:55.490
also because of
the Common Travel Area.

110
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.782
So why is their advice
different to our advice?

111
00:04:58.782 --> 00:05:01.740
Well, in terms of mass gatherings
and sporting events,

112
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.865
I think if you looked at the footage
of, for example, Paris St—Germain

113
00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:07.032
last night, you saw football fans
actually congregating outside

114
00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:12.073
the stadium which had been
closed to supporters.

115
00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:17.115
Often, if you close sporting events,
people then will watch them

116
00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:19.782
in the pub and so the science
doesn’t say that, actually,

117
00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:22.198
the risk is greater
if people go to the stadium

118
00:05:22.198 --> 00:05:23.198
but it is something...

119
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.823
But Ireland knows all that
as well, so why are they...

120
00:05:25.823 --> 00:05:28.740
I’m just using them as an example,
lots of countries have taken

121
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.657
the decision to introduce social
distancing and close

122
00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:31.740
down public gatherings.

123
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.407
I’m not saying the government
is wrong, I don’t know,

124
00:05:34.407 --> 00:05:37.032
but I’m just wondering why other
governments are saying their advice

125
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:39.490
is telling them differently.

126
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.698
And I think it’s a fair point,
and I think the key to the advice

127
00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:46.282
that we have government is it’s
about the timing of measures

128
00:05:46.282 --> 00:05:48.448
and what is best suitable
to the country concerned,

129
00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:52.240
and so the approach,
the advice we have, is it’s

130
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.282
about what measures we take but also
at what time we deploy that.

131
00:05:55.282 --> 00:06:00.323
50 things like sporting events,
working under review,

132
00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:04.198
but the advice in terms
of the circumstances we face,

133
00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:08.573
the models that have been done,
is that the time of the measures

134
00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:10.490
we take, that that isn’t
the appropriate action

135
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.907
for the United Kingdom and,
above all, this is driven,

136
00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:15.282
as I say, by the scientific
advice and the models

137
00:06:15.282 --> 00:06:16.490
that is informing government policy.

138
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.407
And, indeed, that is
an approach being taken

139
00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:19.448
across the United Kingdom.

140
00:06:19.448 --> 00:06:20.490
Louise?

141
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.865
Well, let me say that we have been
completely supportive

142
00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:25.157
of the Government’s approach,
which is putting the

143
00:06:25.157 --> 00:06:27.740
Chief Medical Officer
and the Chief Scientific Officer out

144
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.198
there and let it be
medically and evidence led,

145
00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:33.948
that is absolutely right.

146
00:06:33.948 --> 00:06:37.740
It is of note that we are seemingly
out of step with our closest

147
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.282
European neighbours and,
therefore, I think the onus

148
00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:45.157
is on the government to explain why
more aggressive measures for social

149
00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:49.240
distancing or closures of large
events are not being,

150
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.407
are not taking place.

151
00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:55.032
But I think the overriding objective
must be to allow anybody

152
00:06:55.032 --> 00:07:00.073
who needs to self—isolate,
to ensure that they do that

153
00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:03.740
and that they can afford to do that
and that is a particular challenge

154
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.657
in the UK because we have the second
lowest level of statutory

155
00:07:06.657 --> 00:07:07.698
sick pay in Europe.

156
00:07:07.698 --> 00:07:10.282
Only Malta, across the whole
of Europe, has a lower rate

157
00:07:10.282 --> 00:07:13.448
than we do, so for workers
on minimum wage, we are asking them

158
00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:17.032
to make a choice between hardship
and their contribution to public

159
00:07:17.032 --> 00:07:21.990
health, sacrificing as much as £200
a week in order to stay—at—home.

160
00:07:23.907 --> 00:07:26.282
For millions of workers,
they don’t make the minimum income

161
00:07:26.282 --> 00:07:29.532
threshold in order to qualify
for statutory sick pay

162
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.282
and for millions more on zero—hours
contracts or who are self—employed,

163
00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.032
they don’t qualify either.

164
00:07:35.032 --> 00:07:38.115
I don’t understand why this wasn’t
addressed in the Budget yesterday,

165
00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:42.115
because this has to be the most
pressing concern, so we will support

166
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:46.615
the government, we are begging
the government to take action

167
00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:50.282
on this, to make sure
that it is available from day one

168
00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:53.407
for all workers and brought in line
with average pay to allow more

169
00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.865
workers who need to self—isolate.

170
00:07:56.865 --> 00:07:59.532
The public health crisis
is about to expose really big

171
00:07:59.532 --> 00:08:02.698
shortcomings in our social safety
net and I worry that,

172
00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:05.282
if the government doesn’t
take this action now,

173
00:08:05.282 --> 00:08:09.948
both they and we will come
to regret it for some time.

174
00:08:13.615 --> 00:08:16.740
There are a number of issues
when it comes to how

175
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.698
the government is tackling
the coronavirus pandemic.

176
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.907
That’s certainly one of them,
I think we’re going to come

177
00:08:24.907 --> 00:08:27.073
back to that later,
if you will forgive me.

178
00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.948
Just for now, John, I want to come
to on Matthew’s question.

179
00:08:29.948 --> 00:08:32.573
Every European country seems to be
taking proactive action and, also,

180
00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:33.782
other countries around the world.

181
00:08:33.782 --> 00:08:34.990
Is our Government doing enough?

182
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.365
I don’t know where
to start with you.

183
00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:41.823
I mean, I’m embarrassed
by the situation in this country.

184
00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:46.782
You know, there is talk of four
stages and we are now moving

185
00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:48.532
on from the containment thing.

186
00:08:48.532 --> 00:08:52.657
We’ve lost the plot here.

187
00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.490
You know, we haven’t taken
the action that we should have taken

188
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.407
four orfive weeks ago.

189
00:08:57.407 --> 00:08:59.573
So what do you think
we should have done?

190
00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:01.782
BorisJohnson should have convened
COBRA at the outset,

191
00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:03.740
when it became clear
what was cooking up.

192
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.865
The countries that took
firm action at the time,

193
00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:09.323
if you look what happened
in Hong Kong and Singapore,

194
00:09:09.323 --> 00:09:12.240
which had a lot of cases initially
but which took firm action

195
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.907
and they got the thing
under control.

196
00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:16.490
We’ve lost control here.

197
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.365
Last night, I didn’t go to Anfield
last night because, you know,

198
00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:22.490
I had second thoughts about it.

199
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.282
3,000 supporters came to Anfield
last night from Madrid,

200
00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:29.740
where they are playing football
behind closed doors.

201
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.615
The virus is around in Madrid.

202
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:36.782
That virus has been shared around
Merseyside last night,

203
00:09:36.782 --> 00:09:41.782
in the bars and clubs of Merseyside.

204
00:09:41.907 --> 00:09:44.782
The virus is, no
doubt, now among us.

205
00:09:44.782 --> 00:09:49.448
For reasons which are totally
obscure to me, we’ve taken it

206
00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:54.448
as policy not to track the people
who have come back from Italy,

207
00:09:54.615 --> 00:09:57.740
not to test the people who have
come back from Italy,

208
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.823
so the virus will now be amongst us
and the Government’s approach

209
00:10:01.823 --> 00:10:04.865
has been paternalistic,
it’s been old—fashioned,

210
00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:09.782
it’s been top—down and it’s not done
what needs to happen now,

211
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.282
and we’ve lost four or five weeks,
which, if we get the epidemic that

212
00:10:13.282 --> 00:10:16.990
looks like happening,
then it’s going to be

213
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.573
a community issue to be dealt
with by the community

214
00:10:21.573 --> 00:10:24.990
and the community needed to be put
in the driving seat and supported,

215
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.198
because there is no way
in which very sick people

216
00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:31.823
are all going to be able to be
admitted to hospital.

217
00:10:31.823 --> 00:10:34.407
They will have to be nursed at home.

218
00:10:34.407 --> 00:10:38.448
The public will have
to organise itself to do that.

219
00:10:38.448 --> 00:10:42.240
What is beginning to happen
in West Yorkshire and in

220
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.907
Greater Manchester is that groups
are forming up to do self

221
00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:47.532
care, to help each other
to be able to do this.

222
00:10:47.532 --> 00:10:49.948
The Government should have been
facilitating this from the outset

223
00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:51.198
and they haven’t done it.

224
00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:56.157
We’ve had a very narrow,
technocratic approach,

225
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.115
which has not got its head
round the social dimensions of this.

226
00:10:59.115 --> 00:11:01.323
We have learned nothing from Ebola.

227
00:11:01.323 --> 00:11:06.365
With Ebola in 2014, we lost three
or four months because we took

228
00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:09.615
a narrow science—based approach
to this and didn’t understand

229
00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:14.615
the community aspects that related
to the burial practices of folk

230
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.198
in Sierra Leone, where they really
needed to engage with the women’s

231
00:11:18.198 --> 00:11:21.240
committees because they needed
to change the burial practices.

232
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.198
We’ve got to achieve cultural change
here and that cultural change

233
00:11:24.198 --> 00:11:28.907
can’t be done to people,
it’s got to be done with people.

234
00:11:28.907 --> 00:11:33.032
You know, the closure of grounds,
the closure of schools,

235
00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:35.490
will need to happen,
it should be done on an

236
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.823
informed basis depending
on where the cases are.

237
00:11:39.823 --> 00:11:43.532
The Government’s failed
to divulge the information

238
00:11:43.532 --> 00:11:46.240
that the public needs,
to know whether their area is one

239
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.365
where they need to start
taking action or not.

240
00:11:48.365 --> 00:11:49.823
We’ve been kept in the dark.

241
00:11:49.823 --> 00:11:53.490
50% of the population
now goes to university

242
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.365
and they are being treated
like peasants and it’s time we had

243
00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.823
a change of approach.

244
00:11:58.823 --> 00:12:01.240
Steve, obviously, Iwill come
back to you on this

245
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.907
but there are a lot of hands.

246
00:12:02.907 --> 00:12:04.573
I want to get around the audience.

247
00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:06.490
Yes, the man there
in the pink T—shirt.

248
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.115
I’ve got a few things
I want to bring up here.

249
00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:13.782
The first one is I’m very worried,
my wife’s got a heart problem

250
00:12:13.782 --> 00:12:16.198
and it’s terrifying to think
that my kids could bring

251
00:12:16.198 --> 00:12:18.448
the coronavirus home.

252
00:12:18.448 --> 00:12:21.782
The other thing is,
the professor touched on,

253
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:25.782
people coming from Europe
into the country.

254
00:12:25.782 --> 00:12:30.240
My daughter’s school had a group
of children go to Italy only a few

255
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.240
weeks back and they spent half a day
or a day in school, touched things,

256
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.282
coughed, they have been in school,
the teachers and the children

257
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:46.240
and they refused to clean
the school at the start.

258
00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:50.282
I didn’t want to send my daughter
to school because she comes back,

259
00:12:50.282 --> 00:12:52.907
she catches the virus,
she passes it on to the siblings,

260
00:12:52.907 --> 00:12:56.073
siblings go back to another school,
pass it around and it’s very scary

261
00:12:56.073 --> 00:12:59.115
and worrying for me.

262
00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:04.157
So do you want the school to be
closed, is that what you are saying?

263
00:13:05.282 --> 00:13:08.240
Yeah. I’m worried.

264
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.865
If my wife, who’s got a heart
problem, if anything happens,

265
00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:11.907
is BorisJohnson willing...

266
00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:14.323
He said on the radio today
that the Health Minister...

267
00:13:14.323 --> 00:13:15.365
Who was it?

268
00:13:15.365 --> 00:13:16.907
Nadine Dorries, who’s
been diagnosed...

269
00:13:16.907 --> 00:13:19.240
They said they don’t
want to stop the virus,

270
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.198
they want the virus to carry on,
so they get the whole...

271
00:13:22.198 --> 00:13:24.323
Oh, I see, Chris Whitty
and Patrick Vallance, the...

272
00:13:24.323 --> 00:13:26.448
I can’t remember who,
I heard on the radio.

273
00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:27.782
..scientific medical experts.

274
00:13:27.782 --> 00:13:32.115
And, right, 0K, BorisJohnson said
that we will lose more people.

275
00:13:32.115 --> 00:13:34.865
I’m not ready to lose my
wife because of that.

276
00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:35.907
So, you know...

277
00:13:35.907 --> 00:13:40.198
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE.

278
00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:43.532
Yes, the man in the cotton
shirt, yes, you, sir.

279
00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:48.573
I agree with the professor.

280
00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:51.740
For example, people are coming
in and going out, and nobody

281
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.615
is tested at the borders.

282
00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:58.490
Even in my country, Ghana,
where we haven’t got anybody

283
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.907
yet, people are tested
when they are coming in, people

284
00:14:00.907 --> 00:14:03.698
are tested when they are going out.

285
00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:05.615
You allow everybody in.

286
00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:08.282
And then you tell them,
isolate yourself.

287
00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:10.615
Why can’t you stop
them at the borders?

288
00:14:10.615 --> 00:14:14.157
I think the Government
isn’t doing enough.

289
00:14:14.157 --> 00:14:17.240
OK, the woman in the sari,
with the glasses.

290
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.115
The children are less vulnerable
in school so what is the point

291
00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:22.240
of closing the schools?

292
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.823
Particularly for doctors and nurses.

293
00:14:23.823 --> 00:14:26.990
They need to be in the hospitals.

294
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.407
If their children are not
going to school, they might

295
00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:31.823
ask their elderly parents to look
after them, and they

296
00:14:31.823 --> 00:14:35.532
are in the vulnerable
state, so it’s like...

297
00:14:35.532 --> 00:14:38.240
It is a little bit
of a cycle, really.

298
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.240
We need to think hard before we say,
like the Irish Prime Minister,

299
00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:48.823
close all schools, because we need
our doctors and nurses to be helping

300
00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.823
the people who obviously
are going to be needing

301
00:14:52.823 --> 00:14:53.865
a lot of help.

302
00:14:53.865 --> 00:14:57.948
0K, let me get one more point.

303
00:14:57.948 --> 00:15:01.823
Since I arrived here this evening,
I have received a phone call

304
00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:04.948
from my father’s care home,
which is local to hear,

305
00:15:04.948 --> 00:15:07.282
to say they’ve now closed
to the home to visitors,

306
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.115
in light of the announcements today.

307
00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:11.782
I am really concerned
about what will happen

308
00:15:11.782 --> 00:15:15.657
to care home residents,
nursing home residents,

309
00:15:15.657 --> 00:15:18.990
if the staff are. ..

310
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.157
..go sick and self—isolate.

311
00:15:22.157 --> 00:15:24.990
I can’t go in and care
for my dad because I’ve now

312
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.240
been told I can’t visit.

313
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.157
You can’t go and see him at all?

314
00:15:28.157 --> 00:15:29.198
No.

315
00:15:29.198 --> 00:15:31.573
Pete, you’ve taken
a different view in Scotland.

316
00:15:31.573 --> 00:15:33.823
50, Nicole Sturgeon,
the First Minister, came out this

317
00:15:33.823 --> 00:15:38.115
evening and said that,
from Monday, gatherings over 500

318
00:15:38.115 --> 00:15:42.740
people are going to be banned.

319
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.157
So, why are you doing that
and the rest of the UK is not?

320
00:15:46.157 --> 00:15:48.073
There is a very good
reason for that.

321
00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:51.657
First of all, I want to say we very
much agree with what the government

322
00:15:51.657 --> 00:15:54.073
is doing in its approach
to the problems around coronavirus.

323
00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:56.657
It is a four nation strategy that
we’ve totally bought into,

324
00:15:56.657 --> 00:15:59.073
and I think the actions
of the government have been

325
00:15:59.073 --> 00:16:01.448
appropriate and they’ve been
disciplined and measured.

326
00:16:01.448 --> 00:16:04.948
And I agree with so many of the
points that have been made there.

327
00:16:04.948 --> 00:16:08.490
There’s so much conflicting advice
about this, so many countries

328
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.407
are doing different things,
and they’re doing things

329
00:16:10.407 --> 00:16:13.407
to meet their own population
and cultural requirements.

330
00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:16.490
I think what we’re doing
here in the UK is the right way.

331
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.948
There’s even a dispute among some
of the academic staff,

332
00:16:18.948 --> 00:16:21.407
there is another professor
I could quote, Keith Hall,

333
00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:24.823
who says closing schools is a bad
idea because what that does is put

334
00:16:24.823 --> 00:16:26.615
risk to older generations.

335
00:16:26.615 --> 00:16:29.532
If we do that, it’ll be
an issue to do with people

336
00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:31.448
getting to the workers
and looking after children.

337
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.323
So we’ve got to make sure we follow
the best possible medical

338
00:16:34.323 --> 00:16:37.532
and scientific advice.

339
00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:40.365
I am on the House of
Commons Commission so I get access

340
00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:42.532
to some of this information,
and they’re saying that

341
00:16:42.532 --> 00:16:46.490
what we’re doing just now
is the correct and response,

342
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.948
and if we make big population
interventions, we’ve got to do it

343
00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:53.073
at the right time to make sure it
has the best and most

344
00:16:53.073 --> 00:16:54.115
positive outcome.

345
00:16:54.115 --> 00:16:56.740
We’ve come to a point, Fiona,
about the groups of 500,

346
00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.573
we are doing that not because of any
scientific or medical advice.

347
00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:01.073
It’s the same across the UK.

348
00:17:01.073 --> 00:17:03.407
They are saying there
is no need to do this.

349
00:17:03.407 --> 00:17:06.823
But we are doing this to ensure that
staff who might have to facilitate

350
00:17:06.823 --> 00:17:09.698
events of more than 500 people
are available on the front line

351
00:17:09.698 --> 00:17:11.323
to tackle the virus.

352
00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:16.323
I think that is a measured response
that should be taken.

353
00:17:18.032 --> 00:17:20.198
From Monday in Scotland,
no events over 500 people...

354
00:17:20.198 --> 00:17:23.073
So, why do you feel you need
to do that in Scotland?

355
00:17:23.073 --> 00:17:26.198
Is it you have a particular issue
in Scotland with front line staff

356
00:17:26.198 --> 00:17:27.865
compared to the rest of the UK?

357
00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:28.907
Not at all.

358
00:17:28.907 --> 00:17:30.323
So why are you doing this?

359
00:17:30.323 --> 00:17:33.240
We are doing this because we think
everybody who is available should

360
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.323
be on the front line,
ensuring people are assisted,

361
00:17:35.323 --> 00:17:38.490
but why have some events like that
where it will take people away...

362
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.948
Should England be doing that, then?

363
00:17:39.948 --> 00:17:41.365
That is entirely up to England.

364
00:17:41.365 --> 00:17:43.782
This is chicken and egg.

365
00:17:43.782 --> 00:17:47.365
At the height of this epidemic,
if it unfolds as it looks as though

366
00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:51.115
it may, somewhere around 12—25%
of employees will be sick throughout

367
00:17:51.115 --> 00:17:54.323
the whole community.

368
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:57.907
We will have to cover that.

369
00:17:57.907 --> 00:18:00.657
What I would like to have seen
is the Government encouraging,

370
00:18:00.657 --> 00:18:04.032
as we did when I was working
in Cumbria when we had the swine

371
00:18:04.032 --> 00:18:06.907
flu, encouraging families
and communities and workplaces

372
00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:11.907
to have their own plan to be able
to keep the show on the road.

373
00:18:15.823 --> 00:18:18.907
What they’ve done in Hong Kong,
who had a lot of cases initially,

374
00:18:18.907 --> 00:18:21.823
is that they’ve moved over to home
working for all public servants,

375
00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:23.948
unless they really have
to be in the office.

376
00:18:23.948 --> 00:18:27.573
And ﬂexi—working and encourage
the private sector to do that.

377
00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:29.740
The education of the children
is carrying on online

378
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.157
in China and in Hong Kong.

379
00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:33.573
We live in the internet age.

380
00:18:33.573 --> 00:18:35.365
Where is the imagination?

381
00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:39.448
APPLAUSE.

382
00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:42.115
This is the country that’s decided
that through Brexit it can

383
00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:43.532
deal with the world.

384
00:18:43.532 --> 00:18:48.490
And we can’t get our heads
around using social media,

385
00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:52.032
the internet, and so on,
to keep things going,

386
00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:53.698
when we are faced with this crisis.

387
00:18:53.698 --> 00:18:57.073
We are, you know, living in the 19th
century when we need to be

388
00:18:57.073 --> 00:18:59.657
in the 21st century.

389
00:18:59.657 --> 00:19:00.698
Richard.

390
00:19:00.698 --> 00:19:05.657
APPLAUSE.

391
00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:10.282
I totally understand everyone’s
concern at the moment

392
00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:13.198
and in the same way that,
you know, it’s incumbent on me

393
00:19:13.198 --> 00:19:15.323
to say people shouldn’t be
panicking, they certainly shouldn’t

394
00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:17.073
be panic buying,
there is enough food...

395
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.198
There isn’t enough hand
sanitiser, though, is there?

396
00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:20.698
Where is all that?

397
00:19:20.698 --> 00:19:23.240
I’ve tried all week
and I can’t get it anywhere.

398
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.823
There is no shortage
of production of hand sanitiser,

399
00:19:25.823 --> 00:19:29.240
it’s just getting it to the shops
quickly enough because then people

400
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.365
buy it, the shelves empty,
and we are putting it on the shelves

401
00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:33.448
the following day.

402
00:19:33.448 --> 00:19:36.073
I think we all have a
responsibility to play in that,

403
00:19:36.073 --> 00:19:37.115
to shop responsibly.

404
00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:39.865
But, in the same vein,
in regards to communication,

405
00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:43.990
I think the Government also
needs to be very clear,

406
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.615
from my perspective,
businesses’ perspective,

407
00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:49.282
up until last week, communication
was nonexistent from government,

408
00:19:49.282 --> 00:19:52.615
and I’m pleased to say that it has
got better now.

409
00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:55.032
We are now having daily calls
as a business community,

410
00:19:55.032 --> 00:20:00.032
as retailers, with DEFRA mac
and the Secretary of State...

411
00:20:02.073 --> 00:20:04.823
Can I just ask about that
nonexistent communication

412
00:20:04.823 --> 00:20:09.782
with Government because we had
a Secretary of State

413
00:20:10.948 --> 00:20:15.990
for Health here last
week, who said words

414
00:20:19.282 --> 00:20:20.740
to the effect
that the Government

415
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.365
was in talks with the supermarkets,
and there was a bit of a hoe hah

416
00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:26.448
the next day, those supermarkets
saying no, it isn’t.

417
00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:27.948
Was he in talks with you?

418
00:20:27.948 --> 00:20:28.990
No.

419
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.323
We employ 25,000 people,
we are not insignificant but, no,

420
00:20:31.323 --> 00:20:32.823
the dialogue has certainly sped up.

421
00:20:32.823 --> 00:20:35.407
It would be good if they could
coordinate amongst the devolved

422
00:20:35.407 --> 00:20:36.448
administrations as well.

423
00:20:36.448 --> 00:20:39.782
Because we are also having the same
calls with Wales and Scotland,

424
00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:42.948
and it would be good if they had
a senior Cabinet person reporting

425
00:20:42.948 --> 00:20:47.115
direct to Boris to actually look
across the whole gamut...

426
00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:51.448
Communication has been dire.

427
00:20:51.448 --> 00:20:53.865
I’ve heard today of one
of the public health consultants,

428
00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:56.782
I won’t say where or which one,
said she had had three

429
00:20:56.782 --> 00:20:59.157
letters from her gym
about what to do about coronavirus.

430
00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.532
She hadn’t had a single letter
from Public Health England.

431
00:21:01.532 --> 00:21:03.448
She had had three
letters from the gym.

432
00:21:03.448 --> 00:21:05.157
Communications from Public
Health England are dire,

433
00:21:05.157 --> 00:21:06.823
and they’ve been dire
for seven years.

434
00:21:06.823 --> 00:21:11.865
Let’s hear a bit more
from the audience as well.

435
00:21:12.615 --> 00:21:15.240
What we’d like to see is more
sharing of the modelling,

436
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.365
in terms of how do they think this
thing is going to spread,

437
00:21:18.365 --> 00:21:21.240
where and when, and the sequencing
of the delay phase and potential

438
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.240
phases after that.

439
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.407
That’s very important
for us so we can plan

440
00:21:24.407 --> 00:21:26.865
and manage our workforce and also
for our cash flow.

441
00:21:26.865 --> 00:21:29.240
Let me hear a bit more
from the audience before

442
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.698
I come back to you, Steve.

443
00:21:30.698 --> 00:21:32.323
The man here in the purple tie.

444
00:21:32.323 --> 00:21:35.032
I think it is clear
is going to be the biggest

445
00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:39.073
thing in our lifetime,
make no mistake.

446
00:21:39.073 --> 00:21:41.948
I came back from a cruise ship
in the Far East

447
00:21:41.948 --> 00:21:43.490
three and a half weeks ago,

448
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.990
and the guidance back
from the people who obviously,

449
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.823
we went back into the country with,
through the airport, was zero.

450
00:21:49.823 --> 00:21:50.865
We had no checks.

451
00:21:50.865 --> 00:21:51.948
This was when?

452
00:21:51.948 --> 00:21:53.115
This was 3.5 weeks ago.

453
00:21:53.115 --> 00:21:55.240
We’d been in Singapore,
we had been in Thailand,

454
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.323
Malaysia and Vietnam.

455
00:21:59.323 --> 00:22:01.782
At Heathrow Airport,
there was zero checks,

456
00:22:01.782 --> 00:22:04.407
no forms to fill in,
we got to the passport control,

457
00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:06.573
I thought they were going
to ask us whether...

458
00:22:06.573 --> 00:22:08.490
Where we had been,
it was electronic passports.

459
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.115
I went to Bahrain two days
ago and I had exactly

460
00:22:11.115 --> 00:22:12.157
the same experience.

461
00:22:12.157 --> 00:22:13.240
John, I must let...

462
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.282
It’s great to have you but I have
let you talk a lot, I need to get

463
00:22:17.282 --> 00:22:18.448
other people in as well.

464
00:22:18.448 --> 00:22:20.615
Yes, the man with the dark
T—shirt and glasses.

465
00:22:20.615 --> 00:22:22.282
I think you’re missing
one fundamental part.

466
00:22:22.282 --> 00:22:24.448
We just had the budget
and a substantial part

467
00:22:24.448 --> 00:22:27.032
of that covered this issue.

468
00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:28.490
I think there’s a massive...

469
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.532
Fear in every government
about their own economy.

470
00:22:31.532 --> 00:22:36.573
We’ve just entered
a huge global shock.

471
00:22:36.907 --> 00:22:40.990
Every stock market across
the globe has crashed.

472
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.323
And we’ve not addressed the reasons
why we are hung up on the stock

473
00:22:44.323 --> 00:22:47.115
markets to fund everything,
from pensions and everything.

474
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:51.448
Until we address what we are talking
about there, I think

475
00:22:51.448 --> 00:22:53.865
there is a fundamental need
for the Government to think

476
00:22:53.865 --> 00:22:57.698
about that as well as public health,
to balance the two together,

477
00:22:57.698 --> 00:23:00.115
because if the economy crashes,
I am an independent retailer,

478
00:23:00.115 --> 00:23:05.073
not the size of Richard.

479
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.490
But we have had the same issue.

480
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.240
I spent today, six hours,
placing orders all over the place

481
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.323
to do what would normally take one
hour, in preparation of what was

482
00:23:14.323 --> 00:23:19.365
going to come out of COBRA.

483
00:23:20.282 --> 00:23:23.198
But the bank have been helpful,
the insurance company are on board,

484
00:23:23.198 --> 00:23:25.115
everyone is in place
but we are fortunate

485
00:23:25.115 --> 00:23:26.115
we can weather it.

486
00:23:26.115 --> 00:23:28.073
So we have made the most of it.

487
00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.948
Trying to get people not to panic
buy has been a nightmare

488
00:23:30.948 --> 00:23:32.615
but we’ve made the most of it!

489
00:23:32.615 --> 00:23:34.240
I’m not going to lie!

490
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.615
So, you’re selling quite a lot
is what you’re saying!

491
00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:40.782
Yes, the woman at the back
with the blonde hair.

492
00:23:40.782 --> 00:23:43.907
Returning to the closure of schools,
if were talking about closing

493
00:23:43.907 --> 00:23:45.823
schools and having meetings
in public places, how

494
00:23:45.823 --> 00:23:49.240
long is long enough?

495
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.073
I think that is what is
on a lot of people’s minds.

496
00:23:53.073 --> 00:23:55.740
One of the Government’s scientific
advisers was saying, in his view,

497
00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.615
that you’d have to close
because of a 13—16 weeks

498
00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:01.657
to make it effective.

499
00:24:01.657 --> 00:24:03.573
I’m not saying that’s
right, that his view.

500
00:24:03.573 --> 00:24:05.990
Let’s hear from the woman
next to you and I’ll

501
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.990
come back to you, Steve.

502
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.157
I was meant to fly out to India
on Saturday but last night

503
00:24:13.157 --> 00:24:14.823
the Indian government suspended
all tourist visas.

504
00:24:14.823 --> 00:24:16.740
Initially, it was Italy,
Spain, France and Germany.

505
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.657
Within half an hour it
became everywhere else.

506
00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:21.782
I’ve got a friend that has just got
back from India this week

507
00:24:21.782 --> 00:24:24.157
and he said the checks that
were happening at Delhi

508
00:24:24.157 --> 00:24:26.073
airport were phenomenal,
that they were getting screened

509
00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:28.865
left, right and centre.

510
00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:32.573
But as he arrived in Heathrow,
he said nothing at all.

511
00:24:32.573 --> 00:24:36.240
So, very similar to
the gentleman down the front.

512
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.157
My concern is why is it always
the UK that gets caught

513
00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:44.157
with their pants down?

514
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.532
APPLAUSE

515
00:24:45.532 --> 00:24:46.948
Well...

516
00:24:46.948 --> 00:24:49.323
I feel slightly awkward asking,
Steve, if you’ve been caught

517
00:24:49.323 --> 00:24:51.490
with your pants down,
given you’re sitting right next

518
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.282
to me, but what you are hearing fair
is a fair degree of concern

519
00:24:55.282 --> 00:24:59.823
and a lot of questions people feel,
even Richard here, and we’ve

520
00:24:59.823 --> 00:25:03.032
heard whatJohn has said,
they are not getting answered.

521
00:25:03.032 --> 00:25:05.948
And I think it is understandable,
and I could hear the concern

522
00:25:05.948 --> 00:25:08.782
in the gentleman’s voice,
in terms of the care of his wife,

523
00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:10.698
and it’s understandable that
people have that concern.

524
00:25:10.698 --> 00:25:13.573
But Pete was absolutely right
when he said there is an agreed

525
00:25:13.573 --> 00:25:16.448
position on the science,
and it is the science,

526
00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:19.323
it is the view of our top scientists
across all four countries

527
00:25:19.323 --> 00:25:22.032
of the United Kingdom
that is driving the position

528
00:25:22.032 --> 00:25:24.865
and therefore, respectfully to John,
I’m afraid he is at odds with

529
00:25:24.865 --> 00:25:28.532
the leading scientists of the UK.

530
00:25:28.532 --> 00:25:31.448
Other scientists in other countries
taking different views,

531
00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:36.448
and Ireland isn’t particularly
culturally different from us.

532
00:25:36.907 --> 00:25:39.782
They are modelling to their model
and what I’m saying is there

533
00:25:39.782 --> 00:25:40.990
is an agreed science position.

534
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.907
You’re quite right
in terms of the point

535
00:25:42.907 --> 00:25:45.532
with Scotland and the stadiums,
and that is an operational issue,

536
00:25:45.532 --> 00:25:47.948
in terms of staffing,
it isn’t an issue in terms

537
00:25:47.948 --> 00:25:49.032
of the science.

538
00:25:49.032 --> 00:25:51.865
The key issue is the science is
uniform across the United Kingdom,

539
00:25:51.865 --> 00:25:54.657
and we are sharing that in a very
open, cross—party way.

540
00:25:54.657 --> 00:25:58.032
There is a specific issue in terms
of schools and, again,

541
00:25:58.032 --> 00:26:02.032
these questions are not so simple,
in that if you close schools, a lot

542
00:26:02.032 --> 00:26:04.990
of children are cared for these days
by their grandparents.

543
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.240
Grandparents are often
particularly at risk.

544
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.698
Many parents will work in the NHS.

545
00:26:10.698 --> 00:26:13.573
We have overl million
people working in our NHS.

546
00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:17.740
So there are consequences
to these decisions.

547
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.907
So far, 46 countries have announced
or implemented school

548
00:26:19.907 --> 00:26:22.198
or university closures so far.

549
00:26:22.198 --> 00:26:26.157
Yes, and this comes to the issue
of the timing of measures.

550
00:26:26.157 --> 00:26:27.448
It’s magical thinking!

551
00:26:27.448 --> 00:26:31.865
Magical thinking.

552
00:26:31.865 --> 00:26:34.407
This is the advice.

553
00:26:34.407 --> 00:26:38.490
As a minister who is not medically
trained, I came to this evening

554
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:43.532
and said I know better
than the Chief medical for so,

555
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.115
I know better than the Government
scientific adviser, you would quite

556
00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:50.157
rightly would question...

557
00:26:50.157 --> 00:26:53.490
But we have gone from Michael Gove
saying we’ve had too much of experts

558
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.365
to now saying we only believe
scientists from a particular bit of

559
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:59.490
the story, and we are not listening
to what the peoples concerns are.

560
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.657
to what the people’s concerns are.

561
00:27:02.657 --> 00:27:03.698
The public are concerned.

562
00:27:03.698 --> 00:27:06.532
At the end of the day it
will continue to be public...

563
00:27:06.532 --> 00:27:08.698
There is a concern amongst
the public, there is

564
00:27:08.698 --> 00:27:09.740
a unified position...

565
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.407
You’ve got politicians
believing their own rhetoric...

566
00:27:11.407 --> 00:27:14.573
John, we need to let Steve answer.

567
00:27:14.573 --> 00:27:17.573
We’ve got to get this through!

568
00:27:17.573 --> 00:27:20.448
The politicians are believing
in their own rhetoric

569
00:27:20.448 --> 00:27:23.073
and they are wrong.

570
00:27:23.073 --> 00:27:26.198
APPLAUSE

571
00:27:26.198 --> 00:27:31.240
Steve, just wait one minute.

572
00:27:32.115 --> 00:27:35.032
John, I know you feel strongly
and we’ve got you here tonight

573
00:27:35.032 --> 00:27:37.198
but you do have to let
other people answer.

574
00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:39.532
This is one of the biggest
crisis facing this country

575
00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:40.782
for a very long time.

576
00:27:40.782 --> 00:27:43.865
We are not trying to shut you down,
I hear what you’re saying...

577
00:27:43.865 --> 00:27:45.532
The politicians are believing
their own rhetoric...

578
00:27:45.532 --> 00:27:46.573
John, stop!

579
00:27:46.573 --> 00:27:48.740
We have to let other
people answer as well.

580
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.157
The point was raised about airports
and checks at airports,

581
00:27:51.157 --> 00:27:52.823
a number of people have raised that.

582
00:27:52.823 --> 00:27:54.240
What do you say to them?

583
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.907
Well, again, Ithink I mentioned
earlier the case of Italy,

584
00:27:56.907 --> 00:27:59.823
which did put in some checks and it
didn’t stop the spread.

585
00:27:59.823 --> 00:28:01.990
So the issue is what
advice have we had?

586
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.573
The advice was, as with stadiums
at the moment, that that

587
00:28:04.573 --> 00:28:05.615
isn’t the best approach.

588
00:28:05.615 --> 00:28:08.532
But it’s also about the timing
and the lady talked about her

589
00:28:08.532 --> 00:28:10.907
elderly relative and wanting
to visit and, I think again,

590
00:28:10.907 --> 00:28:14.073
in a way, that goes to the heart
of the issue because one

591
00:28:14.073 --> 00:28:16.907
of the concerns we have is that
measures need to be taken

592
00:28:16.907 --> 00:28:19.782
for an extended period of time,
there is a danger that people,

593
00:28:19.782 --> 00:28:22.698
after a period of time,
will start to not comply with that.

594
00:28:22.698 --> 00:28:24.865
Understandably, because you will be
worried about your mum,

595
00:28:24.865 --> 00:28:27.990
you will want to go and see her,
you won’t have seen her...

596
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.032
This is cod science!

597
00:28:29.032 --> 00:28:30.407
You’ve got to let him answer.

598
00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:33.323
John, you have to let Steve answer,
even if you don’t agree.

599
00:28:33.323 --> 00:28:34.323
No, wait, listen...

600
00:28:34.323 --> 00:28:35.823
He’s getting a lot of time.

601
00:28:35.823 --> 00:28:37.865
John, this is how it works.

602
00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:41.490
A, if I say stop talking,
you have to and, B, we have to let

603
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.865
peopla answer and then I will come
back to you.

604
00:28:43.865 --> 00:28:47.490
I do want to hear from your view,
don’t mistake me, but we do have

605
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.490
to let other people answer.

606
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.157
To be fair, as I say,
I’ve been party to some

607
00:28:52.157 --> 00:28:53.323
of the discussions at COBRA.

608
00:28:53.323 --> 00:28:55.865
I met the finance ministers
from the Scottish, Welsh Government

609
00:28:55.865 --> 00:28:57.615
and Northern Ireland Executive
on Tuesday.

610
00:28:57.615 --> 00:29:01.448
We are working across the UK,
because this isn’t about politics,

611
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:04.073
this is something where we need
to come together, we all

612
00:29:04.073 --> 00:29:07.240
have a concern for our constituents
but I come back to this point,

613
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.282
it’s what the expert advice says,
it’s what the facts say and it’s

614
00:29:10.282 --> 00:29:12.032
what the science says
that’s absolutely crucial.

615
00:29:12.032 --> 00:29:14.907
There are lots of hands up,
I want to hear some more.

616
00:29:14.907 --> 00:29:19.782
Yes, the man in the
black shirt there.

617
00:29:19.782 --> 00:29:22.740
So I’ve got two disabled brothers
with cerebral palsy and I agree

618
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.407
with ProfessorJohn but I’m also
really concerned about the closing

619
00:29:25.407 --> 00:29:28.240
of the schools and day centres
and how we, as a family,

620
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.907
will cope with looking after them.

621
00:29:32.907 --> 00:29:37.990
You know, especiallyjust
before the holidays,

622
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.573
we’ve put measures in place
for the Easter holidays.

623
00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:45.032
But if we do thatjust before
the Easter holidays,

624
00:29:45.032 --> 00:29:46.907
we are going to struggle
as a family.

625
00:29:46.907 --> 00:29:47.907
0K.

626
00:29:47.907 --> 00:29:50.073
And, yes, the woman
here in the dark top.

627
00:29:50.073 --> 00:29:52.490
We’ve heard lots of concerns
but one of the concerns

628
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.657
is the result reporting times.

629
00:29:53.657 --> 00:29:54.698
It’s varying.

630
00:29:54.698 --> 00:29:57.407
In Belfast, it’s between
five and 2A hours.

631
00:29:57.407 --> 00:29:59.615
Within other parts of
the UK, it’s eight days.

632
00:29:59.615 --> 00:30:03.532
Isn’t that a concern in itself?

633
00:30:03.532 --> 00:30:04.740
You are worried about tests.

634
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.157
Yes, the man in the T—shirt?

635
00:30:06.157 --> 00:30:08.198
Yes, you.

636
00:30:08.198 --> 00:30:10.782
I think, as a young person,
it’s often put to me,

637
00:30:10.782 --> 00:30:15.240
don’t worry, you’ll be fine,
because young people respond very

638
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.907
well to the illness,
but think the problem is I,

639
00:30:17.907 --> 00:30:20.823
as a young person, can still give
the illness to someone

640
00:30:20.823 --> 00:30:23.615
who is very vulnerable.

641
00:30:23.615 --> 00:30:28.240
I think the message "You’ll be fine"
to my generation is worrying,

642
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.240
because we need to take the same
steps of caution to make sure

643
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.573
we don’t give it to our loved ones
who are vulnerable and could be

644
00:30:35.573 --> 00:30:40.532
killed by it.

645
00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:46.448
That’s a particularly good point
and so many issues around

646
00:30:47.323 --> 00:30:49.490
particularly the ageism when it
comes to this issue.

647
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.615
What we are seeing is like somehow
some of our older people don’t

648
00:30:52.615 --> 00:30:54.532
require or deserve the care,
they obviously do.

649
00:30:54.532 --> 00:30:57.907
There is one phrase we are going
to get very much used to over

650
00:30:57.907 --> 00:31:00.782
the next few weeks or months,
and that is "Flattening the curve".

651
00:31:00.782 --> 00:31:03.907
What that means is we are going
to have to try a slow...

652
00:31:03.907 --> 00:31:06.990
We know the cases are going to rise,
what but what they do

653
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.615
is to have a very slow rise up,
keep the peaks as low as possible

654
00:31:10.615 --> 00:31:12.073
and then a sustainable drop down.

655
00:31:12.073 --> 00:31:13.240
Now, Steve is absolutely right.

656
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.157
How to achieve that and do
that is based on the best

657
00:31:16.157 --> 00:31:17.198
scientific and medical advice.

658
00:31:17.198 --> 00:31:19.323
I knowJohn’s got his
views on all that.

659
00:31:19.323 --> 00:31:22.240
It’s out of step with most
of the advice that we are

660
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.240
getting as politicians.

661
00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.948
We don’t know the answer to this.

662
00:31:24.948 --> 00:31:27.573
I’m not a clinician, I can’t make
any decisions about this,

663
00:31:27.573 --> 00:31:30.240
I can’t tell you about how this
disease will work out.

664
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.573
But what I can do is to listen
to the experts, to the science,

665
00:31:33.573 --> 00:31:35.990
and ensure that is going to be
applied and adopted,

666
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.657
because it is only by doing
that that we are going

667
00:31:38.657 --> 00:31:39.657
to get through this.

668
00:31:39.657 --> 00:31:40.698
And we are only going to get
through this if we do this together.

669
00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:43.573
And I think we also have to be
honest about the challenge

670
00:31:43.573 --> 00:31:46.448
that is facing us, and the lady
brought up about the care

671
00:31:46.448 --> 00:31:48.865
system and herfather
that is in a care home.

672
00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:51.490
The head of Care England has said
the Government does not

673
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.365
have a strategy on social care
and the ability of social care

674
00:31:54.365 --> 00:31:56.782
to respond to it and Richard
comment about the failure

675
00:31:56.782 --> 00:31:58.448
to communicate with supermarkets
is really concerning.

676
00:31:58.448 --> 00:32:00.865
I know of major care providers
in this country that

677
00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:03.240
have not had any contact
from the Government at all.

678
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.157
So, yes, we need to be supportive
of the Government’s general approach

679
00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:08.782
but we also have to be honest
that there are significant

680
00:32:08.782 --> 00:32:10.948
challenges that I don’t think
the Government have necessarily...

681
00:32:10.948 --> 00:32:12.865
Well, we’ve got a question
on exactly that.

682
00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:14.282
50, Mark Taylor, where are you?

683
00:32:14.282 --> 00:32:15.323
Yes.

684
00:32:15.323 --> 00:32:18.740
Are we doing all we can to support
the vulnerable groups to help them

685
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.740
through coronavirus?

686
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.907
Now, you work in the
NHS, is that right?

687
00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:22.948
I do.

688
00:32:22.948 --> 00:32:23.990
What is your view?

689
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:27.782
For me, personally, I have got
a father who is in his late 70s.

690
00:32:27.782 --> 00:32:29.948
I’ve got a sister who’s got
a learning difficulties.

691
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.240
My father’s now starting
to not we nt to leave

692
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.157
the house unnecessarily.

693
00:32:35.157 --> 00:32:39.532
He attends a social event on Monday
and he is worried about going there.

694
00:32:39.532 --> 00:32:41.948
He had his family come down
from Leeds the other

695
00:32:41.948 --> 00:32:45.073
day and he was worried
about going to see them, so that has

696
00:32:45.073 --> 00:32:46.282
started to emerge within him.

697
00:32:46.282 --> 00:32:48.448
With my sister, there
is a difficulty about understanding

698
00:32:48.448 --> 00:32:50.948
what advice to follow because,
clearly, she will hear one

699
00:32:50.948 --> 00:32:53.115
thing and believe that
and then hear another,

700
00:32:53.115 --> 00:32:56.282
so we’ve got that as well.

701
00:32:56.282 --> 00:32:58.948
But I think I’m also concerned
about the homeless as well,

702
00:32:58.948 --> 00:33:02.365
because they seem to be missed out
a lot here.

703
00:33:02.365 --> 00:33:05.240
I’ve got my own personal views
but there is a large quantity

704
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.157
of people we are missing
out in protecting.

705
00:33:07.157 --> 00:33:09.532
Which is picking up
on what you were saying, really.

706
00:33:09.532 --> 00:33:11.073
Absolutely.

707
00:33:11.073 --> 00:33:14.157
You know, I think it is maybe,
it has stopped a little bit

708
00:33:14.157 --> 00:33:19.157
but when there was first public
awareness around a virus,

709
00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:22.032
there was kind of a dismissiveness
about, well, if you are young

710
00:33:22.032 --> 00:33:23.948
and you don’t have any
underlying health conditions,

711
00:33:23.948 --> 00:33:25.157
you will be all right.

712
00:33:25.157 --> 00:33:28.032
Well, since when, as a country,
did we not care about older

713
00:33:28.032 --> 00:33:29.698
people or people with
underlying health conditions?

714
00:33:29.698 --> 00:33:32.365
So the people that you’ve just
described should be our absolute

715
00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:35.448
priority and we should be making
sure that we keep the virus away

716
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:38.823
from them and if they do catch it,
that there are enough critical care

717
00:33:38.823 --> 00:33:42.240
beds and that there is sufficient
health care available for them.

718
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.657
Those should be our absolute
priority in tackling the virus.

719
00:33:44.657 --> 00:33:47.740
John, you were nodding and I could
see you are agreeing with that.

720
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.157
The one thing that occurs to me
from what you have been saying thus

721
00:33:51.157 --> 00:33:53.823
far is that when it comes
to commune, someone to someone

722
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:58.823
like you, for example.

723
00:34:01.698 --> 00:34:02.740
them, how is someone

724
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.157
like you going to be able
to go to work?

725
00:34:05.157 --> 00:34:06.323
And care for the vulnerable?

726
00:34:06.323 --> 00:34:08.490
This is why we need to be
encouraging neighbourhoods,

727
00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:09.740
communities, families,
groups of friends,

728
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.573
to have their own resilience plans
about who is going to look

729
00:34:12.573 --> 00:34:15.990
after the kids if parents are ill,
who is going to do the shopping

730
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:17.907
for Granddad and all the rest of it.

731
00:34:17.907 --> 00:34:19.073
We haven’t had that discussion.

732
00:34:19.073 --> 00:34:21.740
But the vulnerable groups, you know,
there has been very little

733
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.782
discussion about that.

734
00:34:22.782 --> 00:34:25.365
The Government have got predictions
that if you get one serious

735
00:34:25.365 --> 00:34:27.532
case in a care home,
you might finish up

736
00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.448
with a mortality rate of up to 30%.

737
00:34:29.448 --> 00:34:30.698
They haven’t told anybody that.

738
00:34:30.698 --> 00:34:32.115
These are the sort of figures...

739
00:34:32.115 --> 00:34:33.198
Is that true?

740
00:34:33.198 --> 00:34:34.240
I’m
5
0
NW

741
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.948
Is that figure true?

742
00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:39.365
It is planning assumptions
that they have which they are not

743
00:34:39.365 --> 00:34:42.240
sharing with us and,
you know, we have got care homes

744
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.573
now, outrageously big care homes
that the private sector have been

745
00:34:46.573 --> 00:34:48.990
providing, 120 people in this
sort of size of things

746
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:51.657
and that is a group that we need
to look at.

747
00:34:51.657 --> 00:34:54.240
Homeless people, people
sleeping on the street,

748
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.032
are a major vulnerable group.

749
00:34:57.032 --> 00:35:01.115
In Bahrain, where I’ve been working,
it didn’t take me much persuading,

750
00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:04.657
they are going to release early
prisoners from the overcrowded

751
00:35:04.657 --> 00:35:07.657
prison facilities.

752
00:35:07.657 --> 00:35:10.032
We’ve got overcrowding
in our prisons in some really

753
00:35:10.032 --> 00:35:11.657
crummy Victorian prisons.

754
00:35:11.657 --> 00:35:14.282
Those places will be very
vulnerable to outbreaks.

755
00:35:14.282 --> 00:35:17.657
It is notjust the prisoners,
the guards come and go.

756
00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:20.157
The guards are part
of their community.

757
00:35:20.157 --> 00:35:22.282
They can bring the virus
into a prison environment

758
00:35:22.282 --> 00:35:23.532
and it can take off.

759
00:35:23.532 --> 00:35:25.282
So, what are you saying?

760
00:35:25.282 --> 00:35:27.948
What are you saying should happen?

761
00:35:27.948 --> 00:35:30.532
It is under the radar
and it is not being discussed.

762
00:35:30.532 --> 00:35:33.240
They have had outbreaks in prison
in China and in Iran.

763
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.448
They have had outbreaks
in psychiatric units.

764
00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:39.157
These things are not
being discussed, or if they

765
00:35:39.157 --> 00:35:41.073
are being discussed,
they are being discussed behind

766
00:35:41.073 --> 00:35:43.240
closed doors and the public
needs to be involved

767
00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240
in these conversations.

768
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.698
Richard.

769
00:35:51.198 --> 00:35:55.907
I think, from our perspective,
we do all we can to the customers

770
00:35:55.907 --> 00:35:59.073
we serve, the 5 million customers
a week and, as I said earlier,

771
00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:04.032
there is no shortage of food and,
therefore, I think customers

772
00:36:04.448 --> 00:36:06.615
have a responsibility
because our supply chain is very

773
00:36:06.615 --> 00:36:11.615
resilient, there are no stock
issues and, therefore...

774
00:36:11.657 --> 00:36:11.740
Hang on, but there are things that
you can’t get in a supermarket

775
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.198
at the moment, like hand sanitiser.

776
00:36:16.198 --> 00:36:18.782
That is a stock issue, isn’t it?

777
00:36:18.782 --> 00:36:21.532
From our perspective, we do have
some limits on hand sanitiser,

778
00:36:21.532 --> 00:36:24.198
just to keep the volume to make it
available for everyone

779
00:36:24.198 --> 00:36:25.240
and that’s my point.

780
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.657
If you panic buy, then those
who are more vulnerable,

781
00:36:27.657 --> 00:36:30.740
who can’t afford to panic buy
and stock build, which is a luxury

782
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.907
only for those who can afford it
and I think it’s really important

783
00:36:33.907 --> 00:36:35.365
to remember that.

784
00:36:35.365 --> 00:36:40.407
I do welcome the Government’s extra
funding, the 5 billion that came,

785
00:36:41.698 --> 00:36:45.698
and it was heartening to hear
the Chancellor say that however

786
00:36:45.698 --> 00:36:48.323
much it costs, you know,
they will fund our Health Service

787
00:36:48.323 --> 00:36:50.948
to get through this but,
as Louise said, there is more

788
00:36:50.948 --> 00:36:54.657
that is required on social care and,
obviously, a longer term

789
00:36:54.657 --> 00:36:58.823
plan to properly fund
and invest in our NHS,

790
00:36:58.823 --> 00:37:03.865
so that when this thing comes around
again, we are more resilient.

791
00:37:03.907 --> 00:37:07.573
Finally, I think it’s
about community, asJohn said,

792
00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:10.490
and it’s about looking out for each
other and we all have

793
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.907
a role to play in that.

794
00:37:11.907 --> 00:37:14.573
It is notjust Government,
it is notjust retailers keeping

795
00:37:14.573 --> 00:37:17.240
the shops open and selling food,
it’s about all of us,

796
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.323
looking out for your neighbours,
looking out for those

797
00:37:19.323 --> 00:37:22.240
who are vulnerable in your society,
maybe doing some shopping for them

798
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.407
and working together on this.

799
00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:25.782
I’ll come to you in a minute.

800
00:37:25.782 --> 00:37:29.907
Steve, in terms of supporting
vulnerable groups, as Mark

801
00:37:29.907 --> 00:37:34.157
mentioned, there was no mention
of social care and what is going to

802
00:37:34.157 --> 00:37:38.907
be done about that this afternoon.

803
00:37:38.907 --> 00:37:41.573
We will come to the Budget,
I know you’ve got here,

804
00:37:41.573 --> 00:37:44.407
chief secretary, we will come
to that, but in terms of supporting

805
00:37:44.407 --> 00:37:46.490
vulnerable groups when it
comes to coronavirus,

806
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.365
have you written the
NH5 3 blank cheque?

807
00:37:49.365 --> 00:37:54.323
We have said we will fund
whatever is needed.

808
00:37:54.323 --> 00:37:55.782
So is that what that means?

809
00:37:55.782 --> 00:37:57.407
Just so that we are all clear.

810
00:37:57.407 --> 00:37:59.865
What it is about is saying,
firstly, in the Budget,

811
00:37:59.865 --> 00:38:01.782
announced a 12 billion package,
a coordinated package.

812
00:38:01.782 --> 00:38:04.198
And toJohn’s central point,
John is trying to tell

813
00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:05.532
you that there isn’t coordination.

814
00:38:05.532 --> 00:38:09.365
Well, let me give you a concrete
example of coordination.

815
00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:11.865
On Wednesday, we didn’tjust
announce the Budget,

816
00:38:11.865 --> 00:38:15.573
we had a coordinated action
with our central bank,

817
00:38:15.573 --> 00:38:18.365
which is independent of Government,
but announced a series of packages,

818
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:21.240
the interest rate cut,
the package of support

819
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.365
to support businesses in terms
of the credit cycle...

820
00:38:23.365 --> 00:38:25.282
So how is that helping
the vulnerable people

821
00:38:25.282 --> 00:38:28.782
that Mark talking about?

822
00:38:28.782 --> 00:38:31.240
First, there is coordination,
so in terms of vulnerable people,

823
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.698
I spoke, before coming on this
evening, to the deputy

824
00:38:33.698 --> 00:38:34.782
Chief Medical Officer.

825
00:38:34.782 --> 00:38:37.532
She was telling me
about the leaders’ group

826
00:38:37.532 --> 00:38:41.073
that is working with care homes,
working with local authorities,

827
00:38:41.073 --> 00:38:44.448
with Public Health England
and I don’t accept the criticism

828
00:38:44.448 --> 00:38:47.323
of the staff of Public Health
England, who I think are working

829
00:38:47.323 --> 00:38:48.740
tirelessly in response
to this issue.

830
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.157
This is about communication...

831
00:38:51.157 --> 00:38:54.032
If you let me finish.

832
00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:57.240
There is also work going on through
the local resilience forums

833
00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.073
is to coordinate their action.

834
00:39:00.073 --> 00:39:03.198
So the reality is there is a huge
amount of work going on,

835
00:39:03.198 --> 00:39:05.823
there is coordination both in terms
of support for social care

836
00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:07.407
and adult social care.

837
00:39:07.407 --> 00:39:10.032
We can get onto the Budget
and the package of measures

838
00:39:10.032 --> 00:39:13.532
for support in social care,
supporting local authorities

839
00:39:13.532 --> 00:39:16.198
but there is both economic
coordination but there is also

840
00:39:16.198 --> 00:39:17.990
coordination through
Public Health England and NHS

841
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:21.365
England and coordination,
as Peter has touched on,

842
00:39:21.365 --> 00:39:24.615
across the UK through the different
health systems we have,

843
00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:26.782
for example in England
and Scotland, so it’s simply

844
00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:27.990
not the case to say...

845
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.907
Why are they each doing
their own modelling?

846
00:39:29.907 --> 00:39:32.282
Why is the Department of Health
doing its own modelling?

847
00:39:32.282 --> 00:39:35.323
Public Health England
doing its own modelling?

848
00:39:35.323 --> 00:39:37.073
The NHS hospitals doing
their own modelling?

849
00:39:37.073 --> 00:39:39.198
Why haven’t we got one
coordinated set of modelling?

850
00:39:39.198 --> 00:39:43.782
Is that right?

851
00:39:43.782 --> 00:39:47.032
Again, no, it is
factually incorrect.

852
00:39:47.032 --> 00:39:50.323
We have got the scientific group,
Sage, the scientific group

853
00:39:50.323 --> 00:39:52.532
that advises Government,
that comes together with the top

854
00:39:52.532 --> 00:39:55.073
scientists within the United Kingdom
to advise Government.

855
00:39:55.073 --> 00:39:57.990
However muchJohn wants to say
there isn’t coordination,

856
00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.573
the fact that Pete and I,
who disagree on many issues

857
00:40:01.573 --> 00:40:03.240
politically, are saying
we are working together

858
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.407
to coordinate I think tells
the message that people

859
00:40:05.407 --> 00:40:07.115
are working together,
because this is a

860
00:40:07.115 --> 00:40:08.240
common issue that...

861
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.823
Let’s hear from Pete.

862
00:40:09.823 --> 00:40:12.782
We may have a little
difference with an issue here.

863
00:40:12.782 --> 00:40:15.698
Yesterday, I was very impressed
by the numbers that were getting

864
00:40:15.698 --> 00:40:17.865
rattled off the Budget
and all the public will

865
00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:19.073
want to talk about that.

866
00:40:19.073 --> 00:40:21.698
£5 billion has been set aside
for coronavirus and tackling this

867
00:40:21.698 --> 00:40:24.323
and I think that’s fair enough
and I congratulate the Government

868
00:40:24.323 --> 00:40:25.365
for giving that money.

869
00:40:25.365 --> 00:40:28.282
What we don’t know is what’s
going to happen with that money,

870
00:40:28.282 --> 00:40:30.407
and this is where I may
agree withJohn.

871
00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:33.365
There doesn’t seem to be any
particular plan about how this

872
00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:36.032
is going to be applied
across our community within the NHS.

873
00:40:36.032 --> 00:40:39.157
What we are hearing from people
here tonight and we are hearing it

874
00:40:39.157 --> 00:40:41.073
very sincerely, the main concern
is vulnerable groups,

875
00:40:41.073 --> 00:40:45.490
people who may be more vulnerable
to this illness than others.

876
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.365
People who got caring
responsibilities who are obviously

877
00:40:47.365 --> 00:40:51.073
very concerned about their loved
ones and I think we need to know

878
00:40:51.073 --> 00:40:54.740
from Government how this
is going to be applied and how this

879
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.823
is going to be done and I think
people need to be reassured

880
00:40:57.823 --> 00:41:00.948
that this money that has been set
aside, a generous amount of money

881
00:41:00.948 --> 00:41:03.573
that has been set aside,
will get through to ensure these

882
00:41:03.573 --> 00:41:05.032
groups are supported
adequately and properly.

883
00:41:05.032 --> 00:41:07.407
OK, I’m going to come
to the audience, so, briefly.

884
00:41:07.407 --> 00:41:10.323
The key challenge isn’t an financial
one, it’s a staffing one,

885
00:41:10.323 --> 00:41:13.240
that is the key challenge we face,
particularly in terms of staff

886
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.990
themselves lost to the virus.

887
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.532
So we are discussing
with NHS England in terms

888
00:41:17.532 --> 00:41:21.032
of what finance is needed,
we’ve set out a £5 billion package

889
00:41:21.032 --> 00:41:23.990
in the Budget as part of a wider
£12 billion package and,

890
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:28.823
as required, we will increase that
if that is what is required.

891
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:31.407
But the issue isn’t one
of finance, the issue is much

892
00:41:31.407 --> 00:41:32.615
more one of staffing.

893
00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:35.698
No mention of funding
for local public health.

894
00:41:35.698 --> 00:41:38.115
The issue in terms of pressure
on staffing and, again,

895
00:41:38.115 --> 00:41:40.532
it comes back to the point
we touched on earlier,

896
00:41:40.532 --> 00:41:43.448
in terms of the timing
of interventions because I’m also

897
00:41:43.448 --> 00:41:46.365
concerned about the pressure on NHS
staff themselves and in terms of,

898
00:41:46.365 --> 00:41:49.282
for example, NHS111 call staff
are under pressure and my plea

899
00:41:49.282 --> 00:41:52.365
tonight is for people to use NHS
online in terms of their inquiries

900
00:41:52.365 --> 00:41:57.407
because, as someone touched
on earlier, people are hearing

901
00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:02.532
lots of different things,
they are, unfortunately,

902
00:42:02.532 --> 00:42:05.990
hearing things at odds
with our leading scientific advice,

903
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:11.032
so NHS online is the place to go,
that is where people should

904
00:42:11.157 --> 00:42:13.573
get their advice and we must
time our interventions because...

905
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:15.032
Do you believe this stuff?

906
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.282
No.

907
00:42:16.282 --> 00:42:17.948
Actually...

908
00:42:17.948 --> 00:42:21.323
The public don’t believe this.

909
00:42:21.323 --> 00:42:24.990
John at the moment is a reasonably
[one voice on the panel and I’m not

910
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.823
forming a judgment on whetherJohn
is right or not, I wouldn’t

911
00:42:27.823 --> 00:42:30.198
know, I know specialist.

912
00:42:30.198 --> 00:42:31.323
know, I am no specialist.

913
00:42:31.323 --> 00:42:33.740
Jeremy Hunt, obviously Secretary
of State for health for many,

914
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.407
many years, was saying tonight
that he is concerned and surprised

915
00:42:36.407 --> 00:42:38.115
that more is not being done sooner.

916
00:42:38.115 --> 00:42:40.490
Just seeing the reaction
you are getting from people here,

917
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.323
this is such a different feeling
to Question Time last week where,

918
00:42:43.323 --> 00:42:47.990
by and large, the audience had
questions butjust sat quietly,

919
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.657
listened, took it on board, whereas,
tonight, I’m getting a very

920
00:42:50.657 --> 00:42:52.490
different feeling from the audience.

921
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.323
You mentionjeremy and I phoned him
this morning, spoke to him.

922
00:42:55.323 --> 00:42:59.573
He was our longest serving
Health Secretary, he’s obviously

923
00:42:59.573 --> 00:43:01.698
a very informed voice,
so we are engaging with

924
00:43:01.698 --> 00:43:05.365
parliamentarians, we are engaging
across the United Kingdom.

925
00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:07.990
I’ll come back to the point,
it is a concerted approach

926
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.448
we are taking forward.

927
00:43:09.448 --> 00:43:13.032
I’m going to take a few more points
from the audience before I move on.

928
00:43:13.032 --> 00:43:14.448
The man in the blue sweater.

929
00:43:14.448 --> 00:43:19.490
You talk about the NHS staff and how
you’re worried about them,

930
00:43:19.573 --> 00:43:21.365
You talk about the NHS staff and how
you’re worried about them,

931
00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.073
and the blank cheque,
the £5 billion.

932
00:43:23.073 --> 00:43:24.490
Where was this before
the coronavirus?

933
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.907
We’ve been under pressure for years.

934
00:43:25.907 --> 00:43:26.948
APPLAUSE.

935
00:43:26.948 --> 00:43:28.157
Are you an NHS worker?

936
00:43:28.157 --> 00:43:29.865
What do you do in the NHS?

937
00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:32.448
I am an audiologist, and I mainly
work with vulnerable adults,

938
00:43:32.448 --> 00:43:34.615
actually, who have medical
conditions, and they are coming

939
00:43:34.615 --> 00:43:37.032
in to see me for hearing
tests and what not.

940
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:39.240
Are you feeling prepared
and that you know enough?

941
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.365
To be honest, not really.

942
00:43:40.365 --> 00:43:43.032
We’re not even asking the right
questions of where they’ve come

943
00:43:43.032 --> 00:43:44.907
from, if they’ve travelled,
or anything like that.

944
00:43:44.907 --> 00:43:47.698
Not getting any support,
to be honest with you.

945
00:43:47.698 --> 00:43:51.615
Like I said, I think the NHS has
been under pressure for years now,

946
00:43:51.615 --> 00:43:54.448
and now this has come
all of a sudden, where is this

947
00:43:54.448 --> 00:43:55.532
£5 billion coming from?

948
00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:57.365
We might get onto that.

949
00:43:57.365 --> 00:44:00.823
Yes, the woman here
in the black cardigan.

950
00:44:00.823 --> 00:44:05.865
You’ve just said to go to NHS online
because that’s the best place to go.

951
00:44:06.698 --> 00:44:09.782
As we already know, 111 has been
giving out the wrong

952
00:44:09.782 --> 00:44:11.615
information to some people...

953
00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:14.990
What do you mean, specifically?

954
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:19.407
I read today that 111 advisers have
been telling people that

955
00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:24.407
are potential corona sufferers
the wrong advice, telling

956
00:44:24.782 --> 00:44:29.240
them they don’t need
to quarantine when they do.

957
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.323
Prior to Corona coming
along, I got sick.

958
00:44:32.323 --> 00:44:37.365
I went on NHS online,
it told me the wrong thing.

959
00:44:37.823 --> 00:44:40.782
It was a good thing I had
a feeling and called 111,

960
00:44:40.782 --> 00:44:43.865
and an ambulance had to be sent
for me, and I spent three

961
00:44:43.865 --> 00:44:45.782
days in the hospital.

962
00:44:45.782 --> 00:44:49.823
How can we trust if,
during regular times,

963
00:44:49.823 --> 00:44:52.490
NHS online, that you have just
directed us to, is incorrect?

964
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:57.490
How can we trust it
during this pandemic now?

965
00:44:59.573 --> 00:45:02.657
0K, we are going to move
on with the subject in a moment

966
00:45:02.657 --> 00:45:04.823
but do you just quickly
want to quickly answer,

967
00:45:04.823 --> 00:45:07.740
you have got an NHS worker
there who feels you’re not getting

968
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.698
the right advice, not being told
which questions to ask,

969
00:45:10.698 --> 00:45:12.157
and the women’s 3 point there.

970
00:45:12.157 --> 00:45:15.032
I think in terms of the investment,
we are putting in an

971
00:45:15.032 --> 00:45:16.032
additional £6 billion.

972
00:45:16.032 --> 00:45:18.198
It was our number one
priority at the manifesto,

973
00:45:18.198 --> 00:45:20.323
that’s why we are committed
to 50,000 more nurses,

974
00:45:20.323 --> 00:45:23.032
it’s why we are committed
to 50 million more GP appointments.

975
00:45:23.032 --> 00:45:25.948
It is the centre point
of the manifesto on which we stood

976
00:45:25.948 --> 00:45:28.782
and that is why we are putting
record investment into the NHS

977
00:45:28.782 --> 00:45:30.198
because it is our key commitment.

978
00:45:30.198 --> 00:45:35.240
In terms of in response to COVID—19,
within the package we announced

979
00:45:35.282 --> 00:45:38.615
in the budget, and you say let’s get
onto the detail of the budget,

980
00:45:38.615 --> 00:45:41.907
there was a £5 billion package
specifically to support our public

981
00:45:41.907 --> 00:45:44.532
services, alongside
the support for individuals

982
00:45:44.532 --> 00:45:46.407
and also for businesses.

983
00:45:46.407 --> 00:45:48.740
0K.

984
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.240
We could clearly talk
about coronavirus for the entire

985
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.698
programme, and it is tempting,
I’ve got to be honest.

986
00:45:55.698 --> 00:45:58.823
But there was another thing a lot
of you wanted to hear about,

987
00:45:58.823 --> 00:46:00.365
which is the budget.

988
00:46:00.365 --> 00:46:03.948
So, let’s hearfrom your specialist
subject, you’ll be glad to know,

989
00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:06.032
let’s hearfrom Ben Moore.

990
00:46:06.032 --> 00:46:07.948
Has the Chancellor found
the magic money tree

991
00:46:07.948 --> 00:46:10.615
we were told didn’t exist?

992
00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:15.615
APPLAUSE.

993
00:46:18.282 --> 00:46:22.198
Louise, let’s start with you.

994
00:46:22.198 --> 00:46:25.490
Well, let me firstly say how
welcome any investment

995
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:29.282
is after ten years of austerity,
and it is investment that

996
00:46:29.282 --> 00:46:30.240
communities like this,
here in Sandwell, and my own at home

997
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.948
communities like this,
here in Sandwell, and my own at home

998
00:46:31.948 --> 00:46:34.823
in Sheffield have been crying out
for for the last ten years.

999
00:46:34.823 --> 00:46:38.407
It is pretty gelling to be told
by the Tories for the last ten years

1000
00:46:38.407 --> 00:46:41.407
that we are magicking up money
trees, that we are pursuing

1001
00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:46.198
a debunked economic strategy.

1002
00:46:46.198 --> 00:46:48.573
And to come forward with this budget
yesterday, that commits

1003
00:46:48.573 --> 00:46:52.407
to considerable borrowing
to invest in infrastructure...

1004
00:46:52.407 --> 00:46:55.073
Well, at least you have to admit
they are right, then!

1005
00:46:55.073 --> 00:46:56.157
Presumably?

1006
00:46:56.157 --> 00:46:57.782
They have to admit we were right!

1007
00:46:57.782 --> 00:46:59.907
That is the right way
round, isn’t it, Fiona?

1008
00:46:59.907 --> 00:47:04.157
We have been seeing a lot
of critique and analysis of this

1009
00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:06.073
budget, saying it is effectively
a Labour budget.

1010
00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:07.990
What the Institute for
Fiscal Studies have come

1011
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.073
out today and said is,
despite commitment in certain public

1012
00:47:11.073 --> 00:47:15.490
spending priorities,
notably the NHS and the police,

1013
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.615
austerity will still be baked
in in certain areas,

1014
00:47:17.615 --> 00:47:19.282
particularly local government.

1015
00:47:19.282 --> 00:47:24.240
Sandwell local council is still set
to receive cuts of £15 million

1016
00:47:24.365 --> 00:47:27.282
a year for the next several years,
and that is the real,

1017
00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:29.407
sharp end of austerity that
communities have been feeling

1018
00:47:29.407 --> 00:47:32.323
for the last few years.

1019
00:47:32.323 --> 00:47:35.740
We talked a little bit about social
care so far but this is one

1020
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.448
of the biggest political challenges
of our generation.

1021
00:47:40.448 --> 00:47:42.615
The Prime Minister recognised
that after he was first

1022
00:47:42.615 --> 00:47:43.657
elected Tory leader.

1023
00:47:43.657 --> 00:47:45.823
He stood outside Downing Street
and promised to work

1024
00:47:45.823 --> 00:47:48.740
cross party to tackle it,
yet there was nothing in the budget

1025
00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.865
yesterday about funding or a plan.

1026
00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:53.198
Hundreds of thousands of older
and vulnerable people

1027
00:47:53.198 --> 00:47:56.698
are isolated in their homes
with unmet care needs.

1028
00:47:56.698 --> 00:47:59.282
We have an underpaid,
undervalued workforce

1029
00:47:59.282 --> 00:48:02.823
that is on its knees,
and in the middle of a public health

1030
00:48:02.823 --> 00:48:06.240
crisis, we have still got no plans
from the Government to tackle it.

1031
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.323
This should really have been a major
priority of the Tories’ budget this

1032
00:48:09.323 --> 00:48:12.782
week and it was glaring
in its absence.

1033
00:48:12.782 --> 00:48:13.823
APPLAUSE

1034
00:48:13.823 --> 00:48:18.782
Pete.

1035
00:48:19.282 --> 00:48:22.865
Can I say to the gentleman not only
have they found the magic money tree

1036
00:48:22.865 --> 00:48:27.240
but they’ve stumbled
into a veritable rainforest of them.

1037
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.073
This is about the most remarkable,
curious budget I think I’ve ever

1038
00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:32.240
seen in my 20 years in Parliament.

1039
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.865
It’s like the Conservatives have
dropped this tag of fiscal

1040
00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:39.157
conservatism and somehow
become unreconstructed Keynesian.

1041
00:48:39.157 --> 00:48:41.907
They’ve discovered the value
of fiscal stimulus.

1042
00:48:41.907 --> 00:48:45.448
We always knew we were in for a mad
ride when we got Dominic Cummings

1043
00:48:45.448 --> 00:48:48.240
and his weirdos and misfits
running the Treasury.

1044
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.073
My advice to the good people
of West Bromwich is buckle

1045
00:48:51.073 --> 00:48:56.115
yourself in, because you’re
going to have the ups and downs

1046
00:48:57.407 --> 00:48:59.782
when it comes to this budget,
and how this treasury

1047
00:48:59.782 --> 00:49:00.990
is going to be run.

1048
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.907
It’s going to be
a crazy, crazy ride.

1049
00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:06.490
Of course, there is not so much
the elephant in the room but a herd

1050
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.198
of woolly mammoths in the guise
of Brexit, which barely got

1051
00:49:09.198 --> 00:49:10.240
a mention yesterday.

1052
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.073
The cultural, economic and social
damage that Brexit is going to do

1053
00:49:13.073 --> 00:49:16.490
to our country within the next year
is barely addressed, and I think

1054
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:20.573
this is going to be a real issue.

1055
00:49:20.573 --> 00:49:24.198
We have the good ship conservatism
with her new—found insatiable

1056
00:49:24.198 --> 00:49:26.740
appetite for spending billions
of pounds in fiscal stimulus,

1057
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.448
sailing the seas of uncertainty,
being buffeted by coronavirus

1058
00:49:30.448 --> 00:49:32.573
in the international markets.

1059
00:49:32.573 --> 00:49:35.615
Captained by Dominic
Cummings with his crew

1060
00:49:35.615 --> 00:49:38.115
of weirdos and misfits.

1061
00:49:38.115 --> 00:49:40.115
God help you all.

1062
00:49:40.115 --> 00:49:42.490
How many metaphors do
you want to get in there?

1063
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.407
Hang on, we’ve got the woolly
mammoths, then we have the ship

1064
00:49:45.407 --> 00:49:46.573
and there is the other...

1065
00:49:46.573 --> 00:49:47.615
Oh, the rainforest!

1066
00:49:47.615 --> 00:49:49.865
You mentioned Brexit.

1067
00:49:49.865 --> 00:49:54.198
Richard, you support and have always
supported the idea of Leave.

1068
00:49:54.198 --> 00:49:56.573
Do you still support the idea Brexit
negotiations should continue,

1069
00:49:56.573 --> 00:50:00.907
given everything that is going on?

1070
00:50:00.907 --> 00:50:02.865
Well, yes.

1071
00:50:02.865 --> 00:50:06.490
I see the opportunities
Brexit can afford.

1072
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:09.948
And I was delighted, at least
from a business perspective,

1073
00:50:09.948 --> 00:50:13.032
that we had some level of certainty,
in terms of the future direction.

1074
00:50:13.032 --> 00:50:16.573
But I think at the moment
there is no point chest—thumping

1075
00:50:16.573 --> 00:50:18.240
and having strong rhetoric
with Brussels because

1076
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.990
no one’s listening.

1077
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.073
And this isn’t
the time for argument.

1078
00:50:23.073 --> 00:50:25.448
This is a time for trying
to work with Brussels

1079
00:50:25.448 --> 00:50:27.157
to try to get through this virus.

1080
00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:30.115
So, at the moment, I would pause it.

1081
00:50:30.115 --> 00:50:32.698
I’m not necessarily saying delay
to the end of the year

1082
00:50:32.698 --> 00:50:36.323
but we have a pandemic on our hands,
we have a crisis, and we need

1083
00:50:36.323 --> 00:50:37.323
to get through it.

1084
00:50:37.323 --> 00:50:39.490
In terms of the budget,
the magic money tree?

1085
00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:40.990
Yeah, I am a northern—based
businessman.

1086
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.240
We were founded in the north.

1087
00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.615
Out of our 1,000 shops,
most of them are outside

1088
00:50:45.615 --> 00:50:48.448
of the M25, so I am delighted
with the levelling up agenda.

1089
00:50:48.448 --> 00:50:50.907
But it has to come from
the marginalised towns

1090
00:50:50.907 --> 00:50:54.115
and villages around the UK.

1091
00:50:54.115 --> 00:50:59.115
So, for me, things like HS2
are a waste of money,

1092
00:51:01.073 --> 00:51:06.115
I think it’ll take far too much
time, it’ll cost too much,

1093
00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.698
and I think, environmentally,
hugely destructive.

1094
00:51:09.698 --> 00:51:12.323
I think we need to look
at business rates as well,

1095
00:51:12.323 --> 00:51:14.698
there was something in there
for smaller businesses but that’ll

1096
00:51:14.698 --> 00:51:17.115
do nothing for the majority
of the store closures up

1097
00:51:17.115 --> 00:51:18.198
and down the country.

1098
00:51:18.198 --> 00:51:20.823
It won’t help the BHS,
the Maplins, the Toys "R" Us,

1099
00:51:20.823 --> 00:51:23.407
all of those big employers that
are really struggling under this

1100
00:51:23.407 --> 00:51:24.615
old, Victorian taxation system.

1101
00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:28.240
So, I think there is a lot more
they can do, and making the local

1102
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.532
high streets places where people
want to work and live.

1103
00:51:31.532 --> 00:51:35.782
We have a lot of empty space
on our property portfolio.

1104
00:51:35.782 --> 00:51:39.657
And, yet, property tax is levied
with VAT on conversion

1105
00:51:39.657 --> 00:51:42.282
but not new—build housing.

1106
00:51:42.282 --> 00:51:45.990
I don’t think young people
want to live in out—of—town commuter

1107
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.240
belts with car bourne existence.

1108
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.407
They want to live in these
towns and villages.

1109
00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.573
And it’s so important
because I see it everyday

1110
00:51:52.573 --> 00:51:57.365
in our stores around the country.

1111
00:51:57.365 --> 00:51:59.823
We are one of the most
geographically unequal

1112
00:51:59.823 --> 00:52:02.615
countries in the developed world,

1113
00:52:02.615 --> 00:52:05.032
and we must invest,
notjust in the northern cities

1114
00:52:05.032 --> 00:52:08.573
but in those
marginalised cities and towns.

1115
00:52:08.573 --> 00:52:10.990
Better bus routes, 3 drop
in business rates, and better

1116
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.740
housing for young
people fit for today.

1117
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.115
APPLAUSE.

1118
00:52:14.115 --> 00:52:17.740
Let’s hear from the audience,
man in the red tie.

1119
00:52:20.615 --> 00:52:25.615
I am an NHS governorfor mental
health services for over 12 years.

1120
00:52:25.823 --> 00:52:30.740
One of the key things I’ve seen,
and also I am a board member,

1121
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:35.740
I’ve seen cutbacks every single year
for the past six years

1122
00:52:36.615 --> 00:52:38.282
from the Tory Government.

1123
00:52:38.282 --> 00:52:41.365
We haven’t got investment
in mental health.

1124
00:52:41.365 --> 00:52:43.282
What is the Government’s
agenda on improving access

1125
00:52:43.282 --> 00:52:47.240
to mental health services?

1126
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.240
With realistic investment rather
than just lip service they’ve been

1127
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.740
giving us for years?

1128
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.740
Yes, the man there.

1129
00:52:59.323 --> 00:53:01.948
Yesterday, the Chancellor reeled off
quite a few names of inventors

1130
00:53:01.948 --> 00:53:06.948
who invented and put Great Britain
on the map.

1131
00:53:08.323 --> 00:53:10.740
How would the inventors would need
engineers and other trades

1132
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.657
to put their things back
into the system.

1133
00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:14.115
I never heard anything
about engineers.

1134
00:53:14.115 --> 00:53:15.865
I am an engineer.

1135
00:53:15.865 --> 00:53:19.115
We are actually struggling very hard
to find any engineers,

1136
00:53:19.115 --> 00:53:21.032
especially with Brexit coming,
there is no engineers

1137
00:53:21.032 --> 00:53:22.782
in the UK at all.

1138
00:53:22.782 --> 00:53:24.740
What is the Government doing?

1139
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.657
Are they going to issue bursaries
for engineers, to get them aboard,

1140
00:53:27.657 --> 00:53:29.782
get younger people coming in?

1141
00:53:29.782 --> 00:53:32.198
At the moment, there is nobody
coming into our trades.

1142
00:53:32.198 --> 00:53:34.532
0K, yes, the woman back
there with the glasses.

1143
00:53:34.532 --> 00:53:37.907
I think the magic money tree has
come from the ten years of cuts

1144
00:53:37.907 --> 00:53:39.990
the Tory Government
has put in place.

1145
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.615
You’ve cut education, mental health,
all local government.

1146
00:53:43.615 --> 00:53:47.740
So, you’ve destroyed communities.

1147
00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.240
You’ve destroyed communities
in the West Midlands and it’s

1148
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.657
going to take a lot more
than the current budget

1149
00:53:52.657 --> 00:53:55.323
to build them back up.

1150
00:53:55.323 --> 00:53:58.240
APPLAUSE

1151
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.865
50, Steve...

1152
00:54:01.865 --> 00:54:04.198
You’ve heard what the
audience have had to say.

1153
00:54:04.198 --> 00:54:07.073
We’ve talked about a few other
issues there, they got lobbed in,

1154
00:54:07.073 --> 00:54:08.740
important nonetheless,
about mental health and engineers.

1155
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.032
John, I will come to you, I promise.

1156
00:54:11.032 --> 00:54:14.157
I can see your hand up,
I’m definitely going to come to you.

1157
00:54:14.157 --> 00:54:16.782
What you’re hearing a lot
of people saying is, hang on,

1158
00:54:16.782 --> 00:54:17.990
it was all about austerity.

1159
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.407
Theresa May kept saying
there is no magic money tree.

1160
00:54:20.407 --> 00:54:23.532
Suddenly there is a rainforest,
as you, Peter put it.

1161
00:54:23.532 --> 00:54:26.948
And it is huge borrowing!

1162
00:54:26.948 --> 00:54:31.240
The key is delivering
on our manifesto promises,

1163
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.115
which is our commitment to the NHS
and public services and also

1164
00:54:34.115 --> 00:54:36.240
to addressing the gaps
in productivity and levelling up

1165
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.573
around the United Kingdom.

1166
00:54:37.573 --> 00:54:41.032
The reason we are now able to do
that is because we inherited

1167
00:54:41.032 --> 00:54:46.073
a situation where the deficit
was out of control at 10%,

1168
00:54:46.407 --> 00:54:48.782
where Labour ministers themselves
were writing that all the money

1169
00:54:48.782 --> 00:54:49.948
had been spent.

1170
00:54:49.948 --> 00:54:53.532
And we’ve got that deficit down
from 10% to under 2%.

1171
00:54:53.532 --> 00:54:56.657
Which is why the Chancellor
could announce this package whilst

1172
00:54:56.657 --> 00:55:01.073
meeting the three fiscal rules
that we also set out at the budget.

1173
00:55:01.073 --> 00:55:04.282
You’re now going to send that
deficit right up again.

1174
00:55:04.282 --> 00:55:07.865
No, this is about meeting the fiscal
rules, levelling up the country.

1175
00:55:07.865 --> 00:55:11.490
If I take the five biggest city
regions outside London,

1176
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:15.240
if they were at the same
productivity level as the UK

1177
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.615
average, that would be worth
an additional £35 billion a year

1178
00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:23.032
so we have a gap between the south,
and London in particular,

1179
00:55:23.032 --> 00:55:26.907
and the opportunities in other areas
of the country.

1180
00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:30.948
And we recognise that talent is
equally distributed across the UK.

1181
00:55:30.948 --> 00:55:34.990
But opportunity is not.

1182
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:37.157
So, we need to address
the issues that hold

1183
00:55:37.157 --> 00:55:38.615
productivity back, things
like transport,

1184
00:55:38.615 --> 00:55:41.198
infrastructure, skills.

1185
00:55:41.198 --> 00:55:43.865
That’s what we promised
to do in the manifesto

1186
00:55:43.865 --> 00:55:45.782
and we are delivering
on what we promise

1187
00:55:45.782 --> 00:55:47.407
to the British public.

1188
00:55:47.407 --> 00:55:49.865
So you are not worried
about the deficit any more?

1189
00:55:49.865 --> 00:55:51.782
You have the Office
for Budget Responsibility saying

1190
00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:54.865
they expect the deficit to rise
to a six—year high of 67 billion.

1191
00:55:54.865 --> 00:55:56.532
No, so let me tell you why.

1192
00:55:56.532 --> 00:55:58.532
Firstly, we have got
historic low interest rates,

1193
00:55:58.532 --> 00:56:00.740
which is an opportunity.

1194
00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.823
Secondly, the key thing to look out
for those who want to look

1195
00:56:03.823 --> 00:56:07.407
at the red book is the fact that
debt as a percentage of GDP comes

1196
00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:10.948
down in this Parliament and comes
down in the final year,

1197
00:56:10.948 --> 00:56:14.323
and the key is that we can do this
because of the difficult decisions

1198
00:56:14.323 --> 00:56:16.740
that were taken over
the last decade.

1199
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.240
So, as a result of that,
we can now unlock this investment,

1200
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.615
level up across the United Kingdom,
address the differences

1201
00:56:23.615 --> 00:56:25.365
in productivity...

1202
00:56:25.365 --> 00:56:28.282
Steve, that’s nonsense.

1203
00:56:28.282 --> 00:56:31.115
Your austerity measures held
growth back, held wage

1204
00:56:31.115 --> 00:56:35.448
growth back, grew debt.

1205
00:56:35.448 --> 00:56:36.573
Absolute nonsense.

1206
00:56:36.573 --> 00:56:38.323
John, you wanted to come in.

1207
00:56:38.323 --> 00:56:40.573
Well, there’s three things I’d
like to say, really.

1208
00:56:40.573 --> 00:56:45.532
I mean, I was brought up in the ‘505
and ‘605 to believe that we should

1209
00:56:48.657 --> 00:56:51.240
rejoice when a sinner repents and...

1210
00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.282
..and to rediscover One Nation
conservatism, I think we ought

1211
00:56:56.282 --> 00:56:56.365
to celebrate that and see if it’s
actually going to happen.

1212
00:57:00.282 --> 00:57:03.740
You know, that’s the discussion
we’ve just been having,

1213
00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.282
but we have to recognise,
we’ve had ten years of austerity.

1214
00:57:07.282 --> 00:57:12.282
Michael Marmot has recently
published his follow—up to the work

1215
00:57:14.282 --> 00:57:17.115
on inequalities in health
and there is a ten—year gap in life

1216
00:57:17.115 --> 00:57:19.740
expectancy that has opened up
because of these austerity years.

1217
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.032
And that will take
a long time to sort out.

1218
00:57:23.032 --> 00:57:26.115
What I would like to say
about the Budget is there was no

1219
00:57:26.115 --> 00:57:28.448
mention of public health
at the local level,

1220
00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.115
or the national level, actually.

1221
00:57:33.115 --> 00:57:35.615
Since 2013, public health has
been largely centralised

1222
00:57:35.615 --> 00:57:38.115
into Public Health England.

1223
00:57:38.115 --> 00:57:41.198
They’ve got a vanity project
on the go to spend almost

1224
00:57:41.198 --> 00:57:44.990
£1 billion in Harlow New Town,
where they are going to centralise

1225
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:49.032
a lot of the expertise which we’ve
had since the Second World War

1226
00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:51.740
in regions, regional
specialist public health.

1227
00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.907
It’s a shadow of its
former self since 2013.

1228
00:57:54.907 --> 00:57:57.615
The local level of public health
in the local town hall,

1229
00:57:57.615 --> 00:58:00.448
they’ve had 30% Budget cuts.

1230
00:58:00.448 --> 00:58:03.740
The staffing levels have
been slashed, they don’t

1231
00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:07.073
have their own nurses who can do
the contact tracing and so on.

1232
00:58:07.073 --> 00:58:09.740
There was no mention of public
health in the town hall

1233
00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.948
in the Budget yesterday.

1234
00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:15.323
The NHS side of public health
and the local authority

1235
00:58:15.323 --> 00:58:20.323
side of public health
are equally important.

1236
00:58:22.323 --> 00:58:25.448
We’ve got a weak system
and we are going to depend on it

1237
00:58:25.448 --> 00:58:26.907
over the next weeks and months.

1238
00:58:26.907 --> 00:58:30.073
It is a disgrace.

1239
00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:33.198
The only thing I would say
on the Brexit point that was raised,

1240
00:58:33.198 --> 00:58:35.115
I’m working with Bahrain
at the invitation of

1241
00:58:35.115 --> 00:58:37.032
the Crown Prince, who is providing
personal leadership.

1242
00:58:37.032 --> 00:58:39.657
They’ve got a grip on it,
which I envy in terms

1243
00:58:39.657 --> 00:58:41.115
of what is going on here.

1244
00:58:41.115 --> 00:58:44.157
They are committed to
openness with the public,

1245
00:58:44.157 --> 00:58:46.532
they publish all the data,
they’ve got daily press conferences

1246
00:58:46.532 --> 00:58:49.490
and everything,
they’ve built a camp for quarantine

1247
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.282
in ten days for 3,000 people,
it’s as good as anything

1248
00:58:52.282 --> 00:58:55.448
you will find at Butlins,
and they are testing and they are

1249
00:58:55.448 --> 00:58:59.073
doing the thing properly.

1250
00:58:59.073 --> 00:59:02.157
When I was there the first time,
last month, we realised they didn’t

1251
00:59:02.157 --> 00:59:05.407
have enough testing equipment,
the Crown Prince signed a cheque,

1252
00:59:05.407 --> 00:59:09.448
we ordered the testing equipment
to raise the capacity.

1253
00:59:09.448 --> 00:59:12.073
Our lot were doing nothing.

1254
00:59:12.073 --> 00:59:14.365
Whether we’ve now got
the testing capacity

1255
00:59:14.365 --> 00:59:15.615
for what’s needed, who knows?

1256
00:59:15.615 --> 00:59:18.907
But it’s going to come
from Germany and Switzerland.

1257
00:59:18.907 --> 00:59:22.240
They are not going to prioritise us
any more because we are no longer

1258
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.282
in the European Union and these
are consequences of coming out

1259
00:59:25.282 --> 00:59:30.323
of the EU, and I hope these things
will be realised by people

1260
00:59:32.823 --> 00:59:36.448
who naively thought we can go
on paddle our own canoe,

1261
00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:39.115
and paddle our own canoe,

1262
00:59:39.115 --> 00:59:40.240
this little island of ours.

1263
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.490
Steve, we’re almost of time.

1264
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:45.615
We’ve only got about 20 seconds.

1265
00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:48.990
John started off saying there is no
money but then went on to complain

1266
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:52.198
about £1 billion being spent
on a new facility.

1267
00:59:52.198 --> 00:59:55.532
What I would highlight
is we are investing in particularly

1268
00:59:55.532 --> 00:59:57.282
in our research and development.

1269
00:59:57.282 --> 01:00:01.990
So, £22 billion in R&D,
4 billion more than the manifesto.

1270
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.365
That speaks to the optimism
we have for the country,

1271
01:00:04.365 --> 01:00:07.032
we want to level it up
but we want to invest

1272
01:00:07.032 --> 01:00:10.365
in the technology of the future,
that 22 billion in R&D is a big

1273
01:00:10.365 --> 01:00:12.698
part of it.

1274
01:00:12.698 --> 01:00:15.323
Right, we could keep talking,
couldn’t we, but our hour’s up.

1275
01:00:15.323 --> 01:00:17.032
I’m afraid, we are out of time.

1276
01:00:17.032 --> 01:00:19.448
Next week, we will be
in Weston—super—Mare

1277
01:00:19.448 --> 01:00:22.532
and the week after that,
we will be in Shrewsbury,

1278
01:00:22.532 --> 01:00:25.948
so if you want to be
in the audience, call 033 0123 9988.

1279
01:00:25.948 --> 01:00:28.532
Or go to the Question Time
website and you can follow

1280
01:00:28.532 --> 01:00:29.907
the instructions there.

1281
01:00:29.907 --> 01:00:34.948
And if you want to keep talking
about this, have your say

1282
01:00:37.657 --> 01:00:40.073
on tonight’s topics, you can join
Adrian Chiles and guests

1283
01:00:40.073 --> 01:00:42.948
on Question Time Extra Time,
which is on Radio 5Live right now.

1284
01:00:42.948 --> 01:00:45.573
But, for now, itjust
remains for me to say thank

1285
01:00:45.573 --> 01:00:48.948
you very much to the panel,
thank you to all of you, I’m sorry

1286
01:00:48.948 --> 01:00:52.240
I didn’t get around more of you,
there were so many hands up and,

1287
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.198
thank you, of course, to you at home
for watching and listening.

1288
01:00:55.198 --> 01:00:57.782
From West Bromwich, bye—bye.

1289
01:01:22.573 --> 01:01:25.448
It’s an extraordinary ask,
isn’t it, to, um...

1290
01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.782
..bear a child for someone?

1291
01:01:29.073 --> 01:01:31.157
This is something I want to do.

1292
01:01:31.157 --> 01:01:33.823
I can change your life
and you can change mine.

1293
01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:37.115
Using an 18—year—old fresh out of
a children’s home? Jesus, Emily!

1294
01:01:37.115 --> 01:01:38.990
Well, I’m doing it,
with or without you.

1295
01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:46.032
This lassie has keyed into you,
and you’re not thinking straight.

1296
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.282
It’s exploitation, pure and simple.

1297
01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:53.990
Daniel Docherty, he’s called.
Minted! Owns half of Glasgow.

1298
01:01:55.698 --> 01:01:58.948
Something’s not right.
She’s got all the power,

1299
01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:01.115
but we’ve no choice
but to trust her.

1300
01:02:02.115 --> 01:02:04.282
What have you told them?

1301
01:02:04.282 --> 01:02:06.865
The lassie’s story doesnae add up.

1302
01:02:07.907 --> 01:02:09.740
Do you hear that wee voice
in your head?

1303
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.240
Well, my one’s saying,
"We can do this."

1304
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.407
SHE SCREAMS

1305
01:02:14.407 --> 01:02:15.823
ECHOES: Do this...

1306
01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:24.907
I don’t want a ledger. Hi!

1307
01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.823
Are we going to address
the way you looked at her?

1308
01:02:26.823 --> 01:02:28.615
Should we address the way
YOU looked at her?

1309
01:02:28.615 --> 01:02:31.073
But you’re landlords. It’s weird.

1310
01:02:31.073 --> 01:02:33.032
I cannot not feel what I feel.

1311
01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:35.698
You love her, don’t you?

1312
01:02:35.698 --> 01:02:37.198
I do. I do too.

1313
01:02:43.198 --> 01:02:44.698
Camden calling.

1314
01:02:44.698 --> 01:02:46.573
We’re taking over
its legendary venues

1315
01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:49.073
for this year’s 6 Music Festival.

1316
01:02:49.073 --> 01:02:51.823
Three days of exceptional live music
and DJ sets

1317
01:02:51.823 --> 01:02:54.740
from the beating heart of Camden.

1318
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.032
You can catch all the action,
streaming now on BBC iPlayer.

1319
01:03:18.448 --> 01:03:22.198
50, Laura, we’ve had a sense
for a while about how big an issue

1320
01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:26.157
coronavirus is going to become
but if anyone was in any doubt

1321
01:03:26.157 --> 01:03:29.698
as far as the UK is concerned,
we got a huge sense today

1322
01:03:29.698 --> 01:03:34.032
from the Prime Minister
and the senior scientific

1323
01:03:34.032 --> 01:03:36.615
and medical advisors ofjust how big
a deal it is.

1324
01:03:36.615 --> 01:03:37.698
That’s right.

1325
01:03:37.698 --> 01:03:40.407
Coronaviruse is here, it’s real,
it’s going to affect many,

1326
01:03:40.407 --> 01:03:43.073
many thousands of people,
and we are in it for

1327
01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:48.032
the long haul, no question.

1328
01:03:48.073 --> 01:03:51.157
Actually, the experts are back
and everybody wants to be reassured

1329
01:03:51.157 --> 01:03:53.990
by politicians or by medical experts
but anyone who says they definitely

1330
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:57.157
know what’s going to happen
to all of us is lying

1331
01:03:57.157 --> 01:04:00.240
because it is a new virus,
and we just can’t tell.

1332
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.782
And this virus doesn’tjust affect
people, it affects every area

1333
01:04:03.782 --> 01:04:08.490
of national and international life,
it’s quite astonishing, actually.

1334
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:12.448
Loads of questions to ask
and grapple with and try to answer

1335
01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.282
and we’ve got plenty of time to do
it, welcome to Newscast!

1336
01:04:15.282 --> 01:04:16.323
Newscast.

1337
01:04:16.323 --> 01:04:17.407
Newscast.

1338
01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:18.532
Newscast from the BBC.

1339
01:04:18.532 --> 01:04:22.073
Going to PizzaExpress in Woking
is an unusual thing for me to do.

1340
01:04:22.073 --> 01:04:24.157
You are a white, privileged male.

1341
01:04:24.157 --> 01:04:27.073
No one has got a BLEEP
clue what Brexit is.

1342
01:04:27.073 --> 01:04:31.948
This is not an elitist issue,
this is a quality issue.

1343
01:04:31.948 --> 01:04:36.990
I urge everyone to find closure,
let the healing begin.

1344
01:04:37.032 --> 01:04:39.865
You have stolen my dreams and my
childhood with your empty words.

1345
01:04:39.865 --> 01:04:44.907
You’re failing us.

1346
01:04:52.157 --> 01:04:53.198
It’s Adam in Brussels!

1347
01:04:53.198 --> 01:04:55.115
And it is Katya in Brussels as well.

1348
01:04:55.115 --> 01:04:56.157
Laura in Westminster.

1349
01:04:56.157 --> 01:04:57.240
And Chris in Westminster.

1350
01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.282
And with us we thought we’d better
have somebody who knows what they’re

1351
01:05:00.282 --> 01:05:03.240
talking about in the context
of the kind of health and medical

1352
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.157
side of coronavirus,
as well as the politics...

1353
01:05:05.157 --> 01:05:06.198
Just generally!

1354
01:05:06.198 --> 01:05:07.240
Just generally, yeah!

1355
01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.657
EnterJames Gallagher,
BBC health correspondent.

1356
01:05:08.657 --> 01:05:09.657
Hello.

1357
01:05:09.657 --> 01:05:10.657
Grab a seat.

1358
01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:11.698
Welcome to Newscast.

1359
01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:13.365
Put on a pair of
oversized headphones.

1360
01:05:13.365 --> 01:05:15.532
That is so you can
hear Adam and Katya.

1361
01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:17.032
Laura Kuenssberg,
I feel so privileged.

1362
01:05:17.032 --> 01:05:18.698
It’s very nice to have you here.
