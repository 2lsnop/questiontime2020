66
00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:05.860
question, which is from Chris Marks.
Evening. Was Sajid Javid right to

67
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.193
Evening. Was Sajid javid right to
resign as

68
00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:09.193
Evening. Was Sajid Javid right to
resign as Chancellor today? A bit of

69
00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:14.818
resign as Chancellor today? A bit of
a shock, wasn’t it? Very much so.

70
00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:16.151
a shock, wasn’t it? Very much so.
Would you have resigned in those

71
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.026
Would you have resigned in those
circumstances? I think anybody who

72
00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:21.193
circumstances? I think anybody who
works in politics knows that it is a

73
00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:22.235
works in politis knows that it is a
team game.

74
00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:25.693
works in politics knows that it is a
team game. You rely on the team you

75
00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:28.776
team game. You rely on the team you
work with to give you honest advice.

76
00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:31.985
work with to give you honest advice.
You built up a team slowly over

77
00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:33.401
You built up a team slowly over
years and you trust people you work

78
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.901
years and you trust peopla you work
with, and so,

79
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:36.985
years and you trust people you work
with, and so, if you can’t keep your

80
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.443
with, and so, if you can’t keep your
team, then it does make your ability

81
00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:42.443
team, then it does make your ability
to conduct business that you feel

82
00:04:42.443 --> 00:04:45.026
to conduct business that you feel
you have to do very difficult. So I

83
00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:48.818
you have to do very difficult. So I
totally understand him. So Sajid

84
00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:48.901
totally understand him. So Sajid
javid

85
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:51.860
totally understand him. So Sajid
Javid resigned. He said he felt he

86
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.485
javid resigned. He said he felt he
had no

87
00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:55.485
Javid resigned. He said he felt he
had no choice but to take the

88
00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:57.193
had no choice but to take the
decision he did, because his team of

89
00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:57.610
decision he did, because his team of
special advisers,

90
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.901
decision he did, because his team of
specialadvisers, he

91
00:04:57.901 --> 00:04:59.818
decision he did, because his team of
special advisers, he was being told

92
00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:01.276
special advisers, he was being told
his team special advisers had to go

93
00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:04.485
his team special advisers had to go
if he was going to carry on, and he

94
00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:05.818
if he was going to carry on, and he
would have to use advisers from

95
00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:06.276
would have to use advisers from
Number Ten,

96
00:05:06.276 --> 00:05:09.443
would have to use advisers from
NumberTen, I understand it.

97
00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:09.860
would have to use advisers from
Number Ten, I understand it. Was he

98
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.485
Number Ten, I understand it. Was he
put in a position where he had no

99
00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:14.568
put in a position where he had no
choice? Is that what Boris

100
00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:15.276
put in a position where he had no
choice? Is that what BorisJohnson

101
00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:15.860
choice? Is that what Boris johnson
wanted, do

102
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.901
choice? Is that what BorisJohnson
wanted, do you think? Is it

103
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:18.568
wanted, do you think? Is it
effectively constructive dismissal?

104
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.651
effectively constructive dismissal?
Or is it what Dominic Cummings

105
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:24.693
Or is it what Dominic Cummings
wanted? This is not the first time

106
00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:25.401
wanted? This is not the first time
there have been disagreements

107
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:28.776
there have been disagreements
between numbers ten and 11. It only

108
00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:30.360
between numbers ten and 11. It only
been Chancellor for eight months and

109
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.860
been Chancellor for eight months and
had never delivered a Budget. I

110
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.901
had never delivered a Budget. I
think any government, a new Prime

111
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:38.943
think any government, a new Prime
Minister, especially one who has

112
00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:41.735
Minister, especially one who has
just won a large majority, has the

113
00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:43.110
just won a large majority, has the
right to have the team around them

114
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.235
right to have the team around them
that they want, and part of that

115
00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:46.401
that they want, and part of that
team is fundamentally down to the

116
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:50.360
team is fundamentally down to the
advisers who make up the team. So I

117
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.901
advisers who make up the team. So I
understand Number Ten’s desire to

118
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:56.026
understand Number Ten’s desire to
stamp its authority at this stage. I

119
00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:58.068
stamp its authority at this stage. I
think Surjit Shavit has behaved with

120
00:05:58.068 --> 00:05:59.235
think Surjit Shavit has behaved with
integrity and been loyal to his

121
00:05:59.235 --> 00:06:01.901
integrity and been loyal to his
team, and so I have a lot of respect

122
00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:05.568
team, and so I have a lot of respect
for his decision. —— Sajid Javid has

123
00:06:05.568 --> 00:06:05.735
for his decision. -- Sajid javid has
behaved

124
00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:09.026
for his decision. —— Sajid Javid has
behaved with integrity. He was right

125
00:06:09.026 --> 00:06:10.651
behaved with integrity. He was right
to resign and he’s come up in my

126
00:06:10.651 --> 00:06:12.401
to resign and he’s come up in my
estimation today for doing that. I

127
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:14.818
estimation today for doing that. I
have only been in politics for five

128
00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:15.610
have only been in politic for five
years but I’ve

129
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.026
have only been in politics for five
years but I’ve learned it’s

130
00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:17.443
years but I’ve learned it’s
absolutely vital to have advisers

131
00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.985
absolutely vital to have advisers
and staff around you that you can

132
00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:22.485
and staff around you that you ran
tmst. It’s

133
00:06:22.485 --> 00:06:23.901
and staff around you that you can
trust. It’s not unheard of in

134
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.818
tmst. It’s not unheard of in
politic for

135
00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:25.651
trust. It’s not unheard of in
politics for people to be surrounded

136
00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.360
politic for peopla to be surrounded
by advisers

137
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.401
politics for people to be surrounded
by advisers and staff that they

138
00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:30.568
by advisers and staff that they
can’t trust. Clearly, Sajid Javid

139
00:06:30.568 --> 00:06:30.943
can’t tmst. Clearty, Sajid javid
had a

140
00:06:30.943 --> 00:06:33.276
can’t trust. Clearly, Sajid Javid
had a team that he felt he could put

141
00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.860
had a team that he felt he could put
his trust in, and that was going to

142
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.360
his trust in, and that was going to
be taken away from him, and he would

143
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.360
be taken away from him, and he would
have put round him people chosen by

144
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.943
have put round him peopla chosen by
Boris johnson

145
00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:41.776
have put round him people chosen by
BorisJohnson or, should I say,

146
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:42.235
Boris johnson or, should I say,
probably by

147
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:42.860
BorisJohnson or, should I say,
probably by Dominic Cummings, who

148
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.651
probably by Dominic Cummings, who
seems to be pulling the strings in

149
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:46.193
seems to be pulling the strings in
this government. 50

150
00:06:46.193 --> 00:06:46.485
seems to be pulling the strings in
this government. Sol

151
00:06:46.485 --> 00:06:46.943
seems to be pulling the strings in
this government. 50 I think he was

152
00:06:46.943 --> 00:06:48.568
this government. So I think he was
right to resign. I

153
00:06:48.568 --> 00:06:49.110
this government. 50 I think he was
right to resign. I applaud him for

154
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.776
right to resign. I applaud him for
doing so. I suspect that Boris

155
00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:52.985
doing so. I suspect that Boris
johnson

156
00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:55.443
doing so. I suspect that Boris
Johnson thought he could get away

157
00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:55.943
johnson thought he could get away
with this,

158
00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:56.776
Johnson thought he could get away

Alex, what does this tell us, if

Max, what does this tell us, if
anything,

167
00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:11.985
Alex, what does this tell us, if
anything, about the kind of

168
00:07:11.985 --> 00:07:14.235
anything, about the kind of
government that we should expect?

169
00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:15.485
government that we should expect?
It’s one of the interesting

170
00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.651
It’s one of the interesting
questions arising from the

171
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:18.235
questions arising from the

reshufﬂa, because Boris johnson was
eluted

174
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.026
reshuffle, because BorisJohnson was
elected on a mandate to get Brexit

175

eluted on a mandate to get Brexit
done

176
00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:22.151
elected on a mandate to get Brexit
done one way or another, and then to

177
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:24.985
done one way or another, and then to
change the subject from Brexit to

178
00:07:24.985 --> 00:07:27.818
change the subject from Brexit to
talk about just about anything else.

179

talk about just about anything else.
But it is still not clear what the

purpose of this government actually
is. what

do so by trying to fuse the

prime ministers have been tempted to
achieve but none have ever managed

226
00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:37.360
achieve but none have ever managed
to make work, and so... But you

227
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.651
to make work, and so... But you
think about the early years of Blair

228
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:40.110
think about the earty years of Blair
and Brown,

229
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.235
think about the early years of Blair
and Brown, and it all fell apart a

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:43.443
and Brown, and it all fell apart a
bit towards the end, and Cameron and

bit towards the end, and Cameron and
Osborne, that’s exactly what they

232
00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:47.901
Osborne, that’s exactly what they
did. Yes, but they had worked

233
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:48.985
did. Yes, but they had worked
together in opposition and arrived

234
00:08:48.985 --> 00:08:50.401
together in opposition and arrived
in government with an idea of what

237
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:53.193

doesn’t

doesn’t have any comrades or close

00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:55.776
doesn’t have any comrades or close
colleagues that he can have that

colleagues that he ran have that
sort of

241
00:08:58.776 --> 00:08:59.901
colleagues that he can have that
sort of personal relationship. He is

242
00:08:59.901 --> 00:09:02.026
sort of personal relationship. He is
a bit of a loner with few close

261
00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:27.235
he wants to do and why. The man in
the blue sweater. Unbelievable,

262
00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:28.943
the blue sweater. Unbelievable,
really, that the Chancellor has only

263
00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.818
really, that the Chancellor has only
been in position for a few months

264

been in position for a few months
and hasn’t even delivered a Budget,

00:09:32.651 --> 00:09:34.193
and hasn’t even delivered a Budget,

down the walls and having some extra

279
00:09:57.068 --> 00:09:59.318

foot for himself? We saw he just

280
00:09:59.318 --> 00:10:01.943
foot for himself? We saw he just
took a holiday with £15,000 and we

281
00:10:01.943 --> 00:10:04.360
took a holiday with £15,000 and we
don’t know where the money came

282
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.776
don’t know where the money came
from, so let’s put that to the

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:10.193
from, so let’s put that to the
panel. Is Boris

from, so let’s put that to the
panel. Is BorisJohnson

00:10:13.068 --> 00:10:13.443
to do an impression of Donald Tmmp
and sacking

APPLAUSE

293
00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:24.151
APPLAUSE
Picking up that point, he is a

294
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:25.651
Picking up that point, he is a
relatively new Prime Minister and

295
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.276
relatively new Prime Minister and
he’s got a massive majority. Why

296
00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:28.610
he’s got a massive majority. Why
shouldn’t he decide who he wants and

297
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.526
shouldn’t he decide who he wants and
who he doesn’t? I think there is

298
00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:34.193
who he doesn’t? I think there is
something to be said for that. For

299
00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:35.568
something to be said for that. For
Sajid javid, I

300
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:36.568
something to be said for that. For
Sajid Javid, I think it was a

301
00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:37.651
Sajid Javid, I think it was a
difficult decision, and you build

302
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:38.860
difficult decision, and you build
your team around people you trust

303
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.610
your team around peopla you trust
and you are

304
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.651
your team around people you trust
and you are told, that what is

305
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:42.818
and you are told, that what is
going, you get what you are given.

306
00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:44.151
going, you get what you are given.
It must be a difficult decision at

307
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:45.901
It must be a difficult decision at
that point to say, do I stick with

308
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:48.110
that point to say, do I stick with
it and stay inside the tent or do I

309
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.151
it and stay inside the tent or do I
go with my principles and leave good

310
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:50.526
go with my principlas and leave good
on him

311
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:52.860
go with my principles and leave good
on him for doing that. He had to

312
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.860
on him for doing that. He had to
lose an adviser earlier on, who was

313
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:56.985
lose an adviser eartier on, who was
apparently

314
00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:57.568
lose an adviser earlier on, who was
apparently frogmarched out of

315
00:10:57.568 --> 00:11:00.568
apparently frogmarched out of
Downing Street. Which is not how you

316
00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:00.943
Downing Street. which is not how you
treat people,

317
00:11:00.943 --> 00:11:01.943
Downing Street. Which is not how you
treat people, to be honest. What we

318
00:11:01.943 --> 00:11:05.193
treat people, to be honest. what we
are seeing

319
00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:07.401
treat people, to be honest. What we
are seeing speaks to be off one of

320
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.943
are seeing speaks to be off one of
two things, it’s either a hallmark

321
00:11:09.943 --> 00:11:11.735
two things, it’s either a hallmark
of profound insecurity, you can’t

322
00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:13.360
of profound insecurity, you can’t
stand the opposition because it

323
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:13.985
stand the opposition berause it
makes you

324
00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:15.026
stand the opposition because it
makes you feel insecure about

325
00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:16.276
makes you feel insecure about
yourself and your position, or it

326
00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.401
yourself and your position, or it
smacks of dictatorship, you will not

327
00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:20.985
smacks of dictatorship, you will not
be told, you will not have

328
00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:22.360
be told, you will not have
opposition, you are doing what you

329
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.568
opposition, you are doing what you
want to do and, as Alex says, don’t

330
00:11:24.568 --> 00:11:26.151
want to do and, as Alex says, don’t
know what that is, and that is

331
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:31.110
know what that is, and that is
worrying.

332
00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:32.526
worrying. Liz Truss is now the

333
00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:32.818
worrying. Liz Tmss is now the
longest

334
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:33.901
worrying. Liz Truss is now the
longest serving member of the

335
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.651
longest serving member of the
government, and that is interesting,

336
00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:38.443
government, and that is interesting,
and it’s not something that people

337
00:11:38.443 --> 00:11:38.693
and it’s not something that peopla
would

338
00:11:38.693 --> 00:11:39.526
and it’s not something that people
would have predicted or thought

339
00:11:39.526 --> 00:11:43.360
would have predicted or thought
plausible six months ago. In terms

340
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.943
plausible six months ago. In terms
of Sajid javid

341
00:11:43.943 --> 00:11:45.818
plausible six months ago. In terms
of Sajid Javid and exactly what went

342
00:11:45.818 --> 00:11:46.360
of Sajid javid and exactly what went
on today, he

343
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.401
of Sajid Javid and exactly what went
on today, he walked in all smiles to

344
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.818
on today, he walked in all smiles to
Number Ten and didn’t look quite as

345
00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:52.443
Number Ten and didn’t look quite as
happy when he came out. Would you

346
00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:56.360
happy when he came out. Would you
have made the same decision?

347
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.026
have made the same decision?
Absolutely, John is right, the

348
00:11:58.026 --> 00:11:58.360
Absolutely, john is right, the
unsung

349
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.401
Absolutely, John is right, the
unsung heroes of politics are your

350
00:11:59.401 --> 00:11:59.776
unsung heroes of politic are your
team, who

351
00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:01.818
unsung heroes of politics are your
team, who work hard for little

352
00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:03.568
team, who work hard for little
reward, who built up that loyalty

353
00:12:03.568 --> 00:12:04.151
reward, who built up that loyalty
over time, and

354
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:04.360
reward, who built up that loyalty
overtime, and I

355
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.651
reward, who built up that loyalty
over time, and I couldn’t do the

356
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:05.860
reward, who built up that loyalty
over time, and I couldn’t do thejob

357
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.235
over time, and I couldn’t do the job
I do

358
00:12:06.235 --> 00:12:07.318
over time, and I couldn’t do thejob
I do without them. It must be

359
00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:08.443
I do without them. It must be
difficult in government and, if you

360
00:12:08.443 --> 00:12:11.110
difficult in government and, if you
lose that team to somebody who is

361
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.985
lose that team to somebody who is
the de facto Prime Minister, an

362
00:12:12.985 --> 00:12:14.735
the de facto Prime Minister, an
unelected official, you have to make

363
00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:15.068
unelacted official, you have to make
the

364
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.610
unelected official, you have to make
the decision to go. Sajid Javid has

365
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.943
the decision to go. Sajid javid has
been in

366
00:12:16.943 --> 00:12:17.235
the decision to go. Sajid Javid has
been in the

367
00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:17.401
the decision to go. Sajid Javid has
been in thejob

368
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:18.193
the decision to go. Sajid Javid has
been in the job for seven months and

369
00:12:18.193 --> 00:12:19.693
been in the job for seven months and
I don’t think the Prime Minister

370
00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:21.485
I don’t think the Prime Minister
woke up this morning thinking he

371
00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:23.068
woke up this morning thinking he
would lose his Chancellor, and the

372
00:12:23.068 --> 00:12:24.193
would lose his Chancellor, and the
only accomplishment he has got to

373
00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:26.985
only accomplishment he has got to
his name is a 50p coin with Brexit

374
00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:28.276
his name is a 50p coin with Brexit
on the back. Surely the government

375
00:12:28.276 --> 00:12:30.901
on the back. Surely the government
would not be taking forward the

376
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.693
would not be taking forward the
sacking of the Chancellor in those

377
00:12:32.693 --> 00:12:33.485
sacking of the Chancellor in those
circumstances? But it

378
00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:33.860
sacking of the Chancellor in those
circumstances? But it highlights a

379
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.985
circumstances? But it highlights a
bigger issue, which is that a

380
00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:37.943
bigger issue, which is that a
government that is running out of

381
00:12:37.943 --> 00:12:38.193
government that is mnning out of
control,

382
00:12:38.193 --> 00:12:41.776
government that is running out of
control, with a large majority in

383
00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:41.943
control, with a large majority in
partiament,

384
00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:44.985
control, with a large majority in
parliament, which can’t be held to

385
00:12:44.985 --> 00:12:45.193
partiament, which can’t be held to
account.

386
00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:47.818
parliament, which can’t be held to
account. Joanna and I did the case

387
00:12:47.818 --> 00:12:48.151
account. joanna and I did the use
that beat

388
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:48.526
account. Joanna and I did the case
that beat the government

389
00:12:48.526 --> 00:12:51.693
that beat the government
prorogation, now they are out for

390
00:12:51.693 --> 00:12:53.360
prorogation, now they are out for
judges. They have banned journalists

391
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.735
judges. They have banned journalists
from lobby at Number Ten, they are

392
00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:57.568
from lobby at Number Ten, they are
trying to undermine civil circuits.

393
00:12:57.568 --> 00:13:00.985
trying to undermine civil circuits.
I think this is something that has

394
00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:02.151
I think this is something that has
to be resolved, and characters like

395
00:13:02.151 --> 00:13:03.568
to be resolved, and characters like
Dominic Cummings are running the

396
00:13:03.568 --> 00:13:04.651
Dominic Cummings are mnning the
show, and I

397
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:05.985
Dominic Cummings are running the
show, and I think it is the de facto

398
00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.318
show, and I think it is the de facto
Prime Minister, and that’s not good

399
00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:14.401
Prime Minister, and that’s not good
for democracy. In the front here.

400
00:13:14.401 --> 00:13:16.110
for democracy. In the front here.
You could argue that the behaviour

401
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.360
You could argue that the behaviour
we are witnessing is the classic

402
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.901
we are witnessing is the classic
behaviour of a bully. Right,

403
00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:21.985
we are witnessing is the classic
behaviour ofa bully. Right, 0K.

404
00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:22.360
we are witnessing is the classic
behaviour ofa bully. Right, OK. I

405
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.151
behaviour ofa bully. Right, OK. I
am not sure what

406
00:13:23.151 --> 00:13:23.735
behaviour ofa bully. Right, OK. I
am not sure whatJohnson would say

407
00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:23.985
am not sure whatjohnson would say
about

408
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:27.943
am not sure whatJohnson would say
about that. I think today’s

409
00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:29.151
about that. I think today’s
reshuffle is a perfect demonstration

410
00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:29.735
reshufﬂe is a perfect demonstration
that it is

411
00:13:29.735 --> 00:13:30.318
reshuffle is a perfect demonstration
that it is all about self—interest

412
00:13:30.318 --> 00:13:30.526
that it is all about self-interest
and

413
00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:32.901
that it is all about self—interest
and showmanship for Boris

414
00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:32.943
that it is all about self—interest
and showmanship for Borisjohnson,

415
00:13:32.943 --> 00:13:33.985
and showmanship for Boris johnson,
and it has

416
00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:34.776
and showmanship for Borisjohnson,
and it has not been a concise,

417
00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:37.651
and it has not been a concise,
strategic plan. The reshuffle was

418
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:38.235
strategic plan. The reshufﬂa was
done by a

419
00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:41.610
strategic plan. The reshuffle was
done by a maverick, ad hoc. It was

420
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.110
done by a maverick, ad hoc. It was
certainly a surprise, I think we can

421
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.526
certainly a surprise, I think we ran
all agree on that.

422
00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:45.776
certainly a surprise, I think we can
all agree on that. Let’s move on to

423
00:13:45.776 --> 00:13:46.401
all agree on that. Let’s move on to
another question reflecting

424
00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:48.151
another question reflecting
something a lot of have been asking.

425
00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:53.235
something a lot of have been asking.
Andrew Connelly first in light of

426
00:13:53.235 --> 00:13:54.818
Andrew Connelly first in light of
the Brexit vote, is it right that

427
00:13:54.818 --> 00:13:56.651
the Brexit vote, is it right that
Scotland should be denied a second

428
00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:02.651
Scotland should be denied a second
referendum? Quite a bit on this.

429
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:02.735
referendum? Quite a bit on this.
What

430
00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:02.943
referendum? Quite a bit on this.
what a

431
00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.735
referendum? Quite a bit on this.
What a surprise! Ian, kicked us off.

432
00:14:05.735 --> 00:14:06.193
what a surprise! Ian, kicked us off.
I principally

433
00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:07.235
What a surprise! Ian, kicked us off.
I principally don’t think there is a

434
00:14:07.235 --> 00:14:09.235
I principally don’t think there is a
mandate for it, and I have always

435
00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:12.151
mandate for it, and I have always
taken a principled view, and I look

436
00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:12.318
taken a principlod view, and I look
forward

437
00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.360
taken a principled view, and I look
forward to listening to what you

438
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.443
forward to listening to what you
have to say on this issue in the

439
00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:17.068
have to say on this issue in the
audience this evening, but I have

440
00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:18.943
audience this evening, but I have
always taken the principled position

441
00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:19.651
always taken the principlad position
that it

442
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:19.818
always taken the principled position
thatitis

443
00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:20.401
always taken the principled position
that it is in Scotland’s best

444
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.235
that it is in Scotland’s best
interest to be a member of the UK,

445
00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:23.901
interest to be a member of the UK,
and in the UK’s best interest for

446
00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:26.651
and in the UK’s best interest for
that. Brexit will be bad, we don’t

447
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:28.193
that. Brexit will be bad, we don’t
know what will happen in the next 11

448
00:14:28.193 --> 00:14:29.651
know what will happen in the next 11
months we just had our fingers

449
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:31.985
months we just had our fingers
crossed that things will work out. I

450
00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:34.610
crossed that things will work out. I
don’t think they will, but that’s a

451
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.943
don’t think they will, but that’s a
different question. To have Scottish

452
00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:38.068
different question. To have Scottish
independence on top of that, in my

453
00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:39.151
independence on top of that, in my
view, would be the equivalent of

454
00:14:39.151 --> 00:14:41.568
view, would be the equivalent of
cutting your nose up to spite your

455
00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:43.235
cutting your nose up to spite your
face, and I think we need some

456
00:14:43.235 --> 00:14:47.151
face, and I think we need some
answers to those questions. 50

457
00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:47.776
face, and I think we need some
answers to those questions. So why

458
00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:48.110
answers to those questions. So why
is jeremy

459
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.735
answers to those questions. So why
is Jeremy Corbyn

460
00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:49.318
answers to those questions. So why
isJeremy Corbyn saying, if people

461
00:14:49.318 --> 00:14:49.568
is jeremy Corbyn saying, if peopla
wanted

462
00:14:49.568 --> 00:14:50.360
isJeremy Corbyn saying, if people
wanted a referendum, he wouldn’t

463
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.151
wanted a referendum, he wouldn’t
stand in their way?

464
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:53.693
wanted a referendum, he wouldn’t
stand in theirway? I

465
00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.068
wanted a referendum, he wouldn’t
stand in their way? I thought he was

466
00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:56.693
stand in their way? I thought he was
wrong, we are an internationalist

467
00:14:56.693 --> 00:14:57.985
wrong, we are an internationalist
party agreeing with solidarity and,

468
00:14:57.985 --> 00:14:59.901
party agreeing with solidarity and,
if you disagree with the ends, you

469
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.151
if you disagree with the ends, you
should disagree with the means. The

470
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.485
should disagree with the means. The
last politician to disagree with the

471
00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.193
last politician to disagree with the
ends but facilitate the means was

472
00:15:05.193 --> 00:15:06.151
ends but facilitate the means was
David Cameron, and look what

473
00:15:06.151 --> 00:15:08.485
David Cameron, and look what
happens. We have to listen to each

474
00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:10.276
happens. We have to listen to each
other and respect each other’s

475
00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:10.693
other and respect each other’s
opinions,

476
00:15:10.693 --> 00:15:11.860
other and respect each other’s
opinions, and there will be people

477
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:11.985
opinions, and there will be peopla
in

478
00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:13.068
opinions, and there will be people
in the audience and across the

479
00:15:13.068 --> 00:15:15.235
in the audience and across the
country who think we should have a

480
00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:15.860
country who think we should have a
second independence referendum

481
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.401
second independence referendum
tomorrow, but I think it would be

482
00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:19.026
tomorrow, but I think it would be
bad for Scotland’s interests in the

483
00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:22.235
bad for Scotland’s interests in the
UK and the world, and we need to get

484
00:15:22.235 --> 00:15:24.776
UK and the world, and we need to get
onto two big things, trying to deal

485
00:15:24.776 --> 00:15:26.193
onto two big things, trying to deal
with the issue of public services in

486
00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:27.735
with the issue of public services in
Scotland, which have got worse for

487
00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:29.485
Scotland, which have got worse for
the last ten years, and secondly,

488
00:15:29.485 --> 00:15:31.026
the last ten years, and secondly,
let’s have the big questions asked.

489
00:15:31.026 --> 00:15:34.193
let’s have the big questions asked.
I want a positive discussion about

490
00:15:34.193 --> 00:15:36.651
I want a positive discussion about
why the UK is good for Scotland, and

491
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:39.735
why the UK is good for Scotland, and
I also want to be able to exploit my

492
00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:41.651
I also want to be able to exploit my
independence. Let’s have that debate

493
00:15:41.651 --> 00:15:42.693
independence. Let’s have that debate
rather than talking about the

494
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:44.068
rather than talking about the
process of whether to have a second

495
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:47.443
process of whether to have a second
referendum. Maybe we’ll hear tonight

496
00:15:47.443 --> 00:15:49.026
referendum. Maybe we’ll hear tonight
what the currency would be, the

497
00:15:49.026 --> 00:15:50.651
what the currency would be, the
border at Berwick, all of the

498
00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:51.776
border at Berwick, all of the
wrong—headed arguments we put in

499
00:15:51.776 --> 00:15:51.860
wrong-headed arguments we put in
studios

500
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.235
wrong—headed arguments we put in
studios like this are exactly the

501
00:15:54.235 --> 00:15:56.110
studios like this are exactly the
same as the ones on Scottish

502
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.276
same as the ones on Scottish
independence, and we have to have

503
00:15:57.276 --> 00:16:02.568
independence, and we have to have
that debate.

504
00:16:03.568 --> 00:16:06.901
that debate. I’m going to start by
quoting back at Ian his own words

505
00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:09.443
quoting back at Ian his own words
when he supported a second EU

506
00:16:09.443 --> 00:16:12.110
when he supported a second EU
referendum when he said, when

507
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.901
referendum when he said, when
circumstances change, people should

508
00:16:12.901 --> 00:16:13.068
circumstances change, peopla should
be

509
00:16:13.068 --> 00:16:19.068
circumstances change, people should
be allowed a second vote. Ian is

510
00:16:19.068 --> 00:16:20.651
be allowed a second vote. Ian is
saying that was not his quote, let’s

511
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:26.943
saying that was not his quote, let’s
be clear. Did you agree with it? The

512
00:16:26.943 --> 00:16:29.110
be clear. Did you agree with it? The
8th of April 2019 in the Commons,

513
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.485
8th of April 2019 in the Commons,
you said that. You said you were

514
00:16:30.485 --> 00:16:31.610
you said that. You said you were
paraphrasing somebody else, but

515
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.360
paraphrasing somebody else, but
that’s what you said. When central

516
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.443
that’s what you said. When central
circumstances change, people should

517
00:16:36.443 --> 00:16:36.651
circumstances change, peopla should
be

518
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:38.026
circumstances change, people should
be allowed a second vote. I know you

519
00:16:38.026 --> 00:16:40.860
be allowed a second vote. I know you
were talking about exit, but I’m

520
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.443
were talking about exit, but I’m
saying the same principle can apply

521
00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:42.693
saying the same principla ran apply
to

522
00:16:42.693 --> 00:16:45.901
saying the same principle can apply
to Scottish independence. In 2014,

523
00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:47.693
to Scottish independence. In 2014,
when people in Scotland voted to

524
00:16:47.693 --> 00:16:48.360
when peopla in Scotland voted to
stay in the

525
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.860
when people in Scotland voted to
stay in the UK, it was a very

526
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.068
stay in the UK, it was a very
different UK they were voting to

527
00:16:51.068 --> 00:16:55.068
different UK they were voting to
stay in. One of the central premises

528
00:16:55.068 --> 00:16:57.818
stay in. One of the central premises
of the Better Together campaign was

529
00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:59.318
of the Better Together campaign was
that the way to preserve your EU

530
00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.485
that the way to preserve your EU
citizenship was to vote to remain

531
00:17:00.485 --> 00:17:04.526
citizenship was to vote to remain
part of the UK, and that is now no

532
00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:05.318
part of the UK, and that is now no
longer the use,

533
00:17:05.318 --> 00:17:06.110
part of the UK, and that is now no
longer the case, and we are also

534
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.318
longer the use, and we are also
faced

535
00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:07.276
longer the case, and we are also
faced with the most right—wing

536
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.151
faced with the most right—wing
government we have seen in modern

537
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:10.443
government we have seen in modern
times, which Scotland overwhelmingly

538
00:17:10.443 --> 00:17:13.276
times, which Scotland overwhelmingly
did not vote for. And I believe that

539
00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:17.901
did not vote for. And I believe that
there is a mandate. The SNP, which

540
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:19.985
there is a mandate. The SNP, which
supports independence and a second

541
00:17:19.985 --> 00:17:21.901
supports independence and a second
referendum, keeps winning elections

542
00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:24.151
referendum, keeps winning elections
in Scotland, Ian, we won the last

543
00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:24.360
in Scotland, Ian, we won the last
elaction

544
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:24.943
in Scotland, Ian, we won the last
election pretty impressively with

545
00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:25.151
election pretty impressively with
4595

546
00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:29.818
election pretty impressively with
45% of the vote and over 80% of the

547
00:17:29.818 --> 00:17:34.901
4596 of the vote and over 8096 of the
seats.

548
00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:39.610
In the Scottish parliament, our
democratically elected body for

549
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.818
democratically elected body for
Scotland has voted to hold a second

550
00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:43.026
Scotland has voted to hold a second
independence referendum and the

551
00:17:43.026 --> 00:17:45.068
independence referendum and the
polling suggests the majority of

552
00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:45.193
polling suggests the majority of
peopla

553
00:17:45.193 --> 00:17:46.026
polling suggests the majority of
people now want a second

554
00:17:46.026 --> 00:17:49.235
people now want a second
independence referendum. This is

555
00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:52.026
independence referendum. This is
within the margin of error. The last

556
00:17:52.026 --> 00:17:53.943
within the margin of error. The last
three polls have shown a majority in

557
00:17:53.943 --> 00:17:56.193
three polls have shown a majority in
favour of independence but yes, they

558
00:17:56.193 --> 00:17:57.693
favour of independence but yes, they
are close. They are within a margin

559
00:17:57.693 --> 00:17:59.276
are close. They are within a margin
of error so they are not as strong

560
00:17:59.276 --> 00:18:02.651
of error so they are not as strong
as you would like them to be.

561
00:18:02.651 --> 00:18:05.485
as you would like them to be.
Bearing this in mind, when we

562
00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.568
Bearing this in mind, when we
started the independence referendum

563
00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:09.985
started the independence referendum
campaign in 2012, we started at 28%

564
00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:11.651
campaign in 2012, we started at 2896
and went

565
00:18:11.651 --> 00:18:13.276
campaign in 2012, we started at 28%
and went to 45%. Some people we went

566
00:18:13.276 --> 00:18:13.485
and went to 4596. Some people we went
“P

567
00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:14.068
and went to 4596. Some people we went
up to above 50

568
00:18:14.068 --> 00:18:15.193
and went to 45%. Some people we went
up to above 50 and then fell back

569
00:18:15.193 --> 00:18:18.776
up to above 50 and then fell back
but we will never be sure. Lets cut

570
00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:23.193
but we will never be sure. Lets cut
to the chase. We want to start at

571
00:18:23.193 --> 00:18:23.485
to the chase. We want to start at
5011,

572
00:18:23.485 --> 00:18:23.651
to the chase. We want to start at
50%, that’s

573
00:18:23.651 --> 00:18:23.818
to the chase. We want to start at
5096, that’s a

574
00:18:23.818 --> 00:18:25.110
to the chase. We want to start at
50%, that’s a pretty solid starting

575
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.860
5096, that’s a pretty solid starting
point. what

576
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.651
50%, that’s a pretty solid starting
point. What would you like to

577
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:29.860
point. what would you like to
happen?

578
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.485
point. What would you like to
happen? We have Nicola Sturgeon, who

579
00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:34.943
happen? We have Nicola Sturgeon, who
is requesting permission,

580
00:18:34.943 --> 00:18:36.651
is requesting permission,
effectively, from the Prime Minister

581
00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:38.526
effectively, from the Prime Minister
to be able to hold a second

582
00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:39.485
to be able to hold a second
independence referendum and you want

583
00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:42.943
independence referendum and you want
to go further. I want to be

584
00:18:42.943 --> 00:18:45.693
to go further. I want to be
perfectly clear that I have never

585
00:18:45.693 --> 00:18:47.818
perfectly clear that I have never
advocated a wildcat, or what some

586
00:18:47.818 --> 00:18:48.818
advocated a wildcat, or what some
peopla all an

587
00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:49.401
advocated a wildcat, or what some
people call an illegal referendum.

588
00:18:49.401 --> 00:18:49.693
people all an illegal referendum.
It

589
00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:51.026
people call an illegal referendum.
It would be rather surprising I did

590
00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:54.568
It would be rather surprising I did
so given I am a senior member of the

591
00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:55.860
so given I am a senior member of the
legal profession and devoted a large

592
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.651
legal profession and devoted a large
part of last year to defeating Boris

593
00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:57.985
part of last year to defeating Boris
johnson in

594
00:18:57.985 --> 00:18:59.193
part of last year to defeating Boris
Johnson in court for doing something

595
00:18:59.193 --> 00:19:02.651
johnson in court for doing something
unlawful.

596
00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:03.610
Johnson in court for doing something
unlawful. However, the weight of

597
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.901
unlawful. However, the weight of
legal opinion is that it is by no

598
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:07.901
legal opinion is that it is by no
means certain that the Scottish

599
00:19:07.901 --> 00:19:08.526
means certain that the Scottish
partiament

600
00:19:08.526 --> 00:19:09.985
means certain that the Scottish
parliament doesn’t have the

601
00:19:09.985 --> 00:19:11.485
parliament doesn’t have the
competence to hold a referendum, so

602
00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:15.110
competence to hold a referendum, so
I agree we should be making sure

603
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.110
I agree we should be making sure
that the referendum is properly

604
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.235
that the referendum is properly
constituted and lawful, but I also

605
00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:21.151
constituted and lawful, but I also
agree with Nicole Sturgeon, my party

606
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:22.651
agree with Nicola Sturgeon, my party
leader, that the weight of legal

607
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:25.610
leader, that the weight of legal
opinion is that it’s not clear the

608
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.235
opinion is that it’s not clear the
Scottish parliament doesn’t have the

609
00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:28.068
Scottish partiament doesn’t have the
power to pass

610
00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:29.651
Scottish parliament doesn’t have the
power to pass a bill to hold a

611
00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:31.360
power to pass a bill to hold a
referendum. As Nicola has said,

612
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.526
referendum. As Nicola has said,
it’ll be interesting to that tested.

613
00:19:33.526 --> 00:19:34.651
it’ll be interesting to that tested.
MY

614
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.693
it’ll be interesting to that tested.
My point is that I don’t think the

615
00:19:36.693 --> 00:19:38.526
My point is that I don’t think the
Scottish electorate should be at the

616
00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:42.235
Scottish electorate should be at the
mercy of Boris

617
00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:42.901
Scottish electorate should be at the
mercy of BorisJohnson’s say so.

618
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:42.985
mercy of Boris johnson’s say so.
Boris

619
00:19:42.985 --> 00:19:45.276
mercy of BorisJohnson’s say so.
BorisJohnson is a man with a

620
00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:45.443
Boris johnson is a man with a
cavalier

621
00:19:45.443 --> 00:19:46.776
BorisJohnson is a man with a
cavalier attitude towards democracy.

622
00:19:46.776 --> 00:19:49.610
cavalier attitude towards democracy.
As we saw last year, a cavalier

623
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.318
As we saw last year, a cavalier
attitude towards the rule of law. 50

624
00:19:52.318 --> 00:19:52.901
attitude towards the ml; of law. So
I am

625
00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.818
attitude towards the rule of law. 50
I am interested in finding ways in

626
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.235
I am interested in finding ways in
which Scotland can hold a lawful

627
00:19:57.235 --> 00:20:00.068
which Scotland can hold a lawful
referendum. But I am more interested

628
00:20:00.068 --> 00:20:01.985
referendum. But I am more interested
in creating the vision and the

629
00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:04.610
in creating the vision and the
arguments that will win that

630
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.818
arguments that will win that
referendum. I think it is important,

631
00:20:07.818 --> 00:20:10.735
referendum. I think it is important,
to answer Ian’s point, he is simply

632
00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:12.651
to answer Ian’s point, he is simply
wrong to say that the Scottish

633
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:14.318
wrong to say that the Scottish
Government runs poorer public

634
00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.693
Government runs poorer public
services. The facts and figures

635
00:20:15.693 --> 00:20:17.401
services. The facts and figures
simply don’t hear that out. I’m

636
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:22.235
simply don’t hear that out. I’m
happy to go that later. It is also

637
00:20:22.235 --> 00:20:22.651
happy to go that later. It is also
possibla to

638
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:23.401
happy to go that later. It is also
possible to deal with constitutional

639
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:23.693
possibla to deal with constitutional
issues

640
00:20:23.693 --> 00:20:25.693
possible to deal with constitutional
issues and run the country at the

641
00:20:25.693 --> 00:20:25.818
issues and nm the country at the
same

642
00:20:25.818 --> 00:20:29.276
issues and run the country at the
same time. That happens in lots of

643
00:20:29.276 --> 00:20:31.110
same time. That happens in lots of
countries. Lets go back to the

644
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.193
countries. Lets go back to the
audience. I gave you a

645
00:20:32.193 --> 00:20:32.485
countries. Lets go back to the
audience. I gave you along

646
00:20:32.485 --> 00:20:32.818
countries. Lets go back to the
audience. I gave you a long time to

647
00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:34.735
audience. I gave you a long time to
talk there. Lots of people want to

648
00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:35.318
talk there. Lots of peopla want to
cut in. The

649
00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:39.318
talk there. Lots of people want to
cut in. The man with the glasses. UC

650
00:20:39.318 --> 00:20:41.693
cut in. The man with the glasses. UC
you are going to be having an

651
00:20:41.693 --> 00:20:46.943
you are going to be having an
advisory independence referendum.

652
00:20:49.026 --> 00:20:54.193
advisory independence referendum. I
will go round the audience in a bit.

653
00:20:54.193 --> 00:20:56.526
will go round the audience in a hit.
As the only remaining Labour MP in

654
00:20:56.526 --> 00:20:56.943
As the only remaining labour MP in
Scotland, Ian

655
00:20:56.943 --> 00:20:58.318
As the only remaining Labour MP in
Scotland, Ian Murray must see that

656
00:20:58.318 --> 00:21:00.360
Scotland, Ian Murray must see that
his party has to change their stance

657
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.985
his party has to change their stance
on the independence referendum issue

658
00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:03.401
on the independence referendum issue
if they want to re—engage with the

659
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.485
if they want to re—engage with the
Scottish electorate. And in the

660
00:21:06.485 --> 00:21:11.485
Scottish electorate. And in the
Graeme White T—shirt? —— the grey

661
00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:11.901
Graeme white T-shirt? -- the grey
and white

662
00:21:11.901 --> 00:21:15.276
Graeme White T—shirt? —— the grey
and white T—shirt. You said the SNP

663
00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:16.276
and white T-shirt. You said the SNP
only got 4596 of

664
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.568
and white T—shirt. You said the SNP
only got 45% of the vote but I know

665
00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:18.110
only got 4596 of the vote but I know
loads of

666
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.443
only got 45% of the vote but I know
loads of people who would vote for

667
00:21:19.443 --> 00:21:21.193
loads of people who would vote for
independents who didn’t vote for the

668
00:21:21.193 --> 00:21:27.776
independents who didn’t vote for the
SNP. The woman in the purple top. I

669
00:21:27.776 --> 00:21:29.151
SNP. The woman in the purpla top. I
fear that

670
00:21:29.151 --> 00:21:30.401
SNP. The woman in the purple top. I
fear that Brexit has become a

671
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:33.235
fear that Brexit has become a
convenient fuel to reignite the

672
00:21:33.235 --> 00:21:34.693
convenient fuel to reignite the
independence fire, and I think what

673
00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:37.610
independence fire, and I think what
Scotland needs to hear is what the

674
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.568
Scotland needs to hear is what the
economic arguments are for or

675
00:21:39.568 --> 00:21:44.693
economic arguments are for or
against independence.

676
00:21:45.026 --> 00:21:47.901
against independence. Tom, Brexit is
the fuel to the independence fire.

677
00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:52.193
the fuel to the independence fire.
Is this going to lie at Boris

678
00:21:52.193 --> 00:21:53.151
Is this going to lie at Boris
johnson’s

679
00:21:53.151 --> 00:21:56.401
Is this going to lie at Boris
Johnson’s door? I got into politics

680
00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:57.901
johnson’s door? I got into politic
for a simple

681
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:58.901
Johnson’s door? I got into politics
for a simple reason, to serve our

682
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.026
for a simple reason, to serve our
communities and improve the lives of

683
00:22:00.026 --> 00:22:01.568
communities and improve the lives of
the people we are lucky enough to

684
00:22:01.568 --> 00:22:04.401
the people we are lucky enough to
share these islands with. When I

685
00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:04.568
share these islands with. when I
look

686
00:22:04.568 --> 00:22:06.235
share these islands with. When I
look around the country and I see

687
00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:06.568
look around the country and I see
the stmgglos

688
00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:08.068
look around the country and I see
the struggles that we are having in

689
00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:08.735
the stmgglas that we are having in
making sure

690
00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:09.610
the struggles that we are having in
making sure the health service runs

691
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.360
making sure the health service runs
well and that schools are delivering

692
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.818
well and that schools are delivering
the results we want to see for our

693
00:22:14.818 --> 00:22:17.193
the results we want to see for our
kids. When I look at the

694
00:22:17.193 --> 00:22:18.610
kids. When I look at the
infrastructure investments we need

695
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.068
infrastmcture investments we need
to see,

696
00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:20.901
infrastructure investments we need
to see, whether it’s the Queensferry

697
00:22:20.901 --> 00:22:24.193
to see, whether it’s the Queensferry
Bridge or any other improvements we

698
00:22:24.193 --> 00:22:26.735
Bridge or any other improvements we
need to get, and I see another

699
00:22:26.735 --> 00:22:28.318
need to get, and I see another
argument about a constitutional

700
00:22:28.318 --> 00:22:33.193
argument about a constitutional
change that is going to distract

701
00:22:33.193 --> 00:22:34.610
change that is going to distract
politicians from serving people,

702
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.901
politicians from sewing peopla,
from sewing

703
00:22:35.901 --> 00:22:37.318
politicians from serving people,
from serving what we really need,

704
00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:37.901
from sewing what we really need,
reducing

705
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:39.818
from serving what we really need,
reducing waiting times, treating

706
00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:41.401
reducing waiting times, treating
cancer, educating kids, building the

707
00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.943
cancer, educating kids, building the
economy, and I see instead another

708
00:22:43.943 --> 00:22:47.360
economy, and I see instead another
argument about whether or not we

709
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.360
argument about whether or not we
should split up our country, I have

710
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.818
should split up our country, I have
to say I find it very sad. And I

711
00:22:51.818 --> 00:22:53.943
to say I find it very sad. And I
find it very sad because this is not

712
00:22:53.943 --> 00:22:56.068
find it very sad because this is not
an economic argument for me. This is

713
00:22:56.068 --> 00:22:57.610
an economic argument for me. This is
not an argument as to whether

714
00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.568
not an argument as to whether
Scotland is big enough or too small

715
00:22:59.568 --> 00:23:01.985
Scotland is big enough or too small
or whether England would be better

716
00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:04.401
or whether England would be better
or worse without Scotland. For me,

717
00:23:04.401 --> 00:23:05.860
or worse without Scotland. For me,
this is a fundamental argument about

718
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.568
this is a fundamental argument about
who we are as a people. When I look

719
00:23:10.568 --> 00:23:10.776
who we are as a peoplo. when I look
around

720
00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:13.193
who we are as a people. When I look
around these islands, I am not a

721
00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:15.026
around these islands, I am not a
foreigner in Dundee. This is our

722
00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:17.193
foreigner in Dundee. This is our
country and we share it together. I

723
00:23:17.193 --> 00:23:21.443
country and we share it together. I
feel incredibly sad when people talk

724
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:22.360
feel incredibly sad when peopla talk
in a way that

725
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.651
feel incredibly sad when people talk
in a way that splits us and divide

726
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:25.568
in a way that splits us and divide
us. I know politicians of all sides

727
00:23:25.568 --> 00:23:27.443
us. I know politicians of all sides
do this, so it’s not a partisan

728
00:23:27.443 --> 00:23:28.735
do this, so it’s not a partisan
point, but

729
00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:29.193
do this, so it’s not a partisan
point, butl

730
00:23:29.193 --> 00:23:30.276
do this, so it’s not a partisan
point, but I find it deeply sad when

731
00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:31.985
point, but I find it deeply sad when
actually these islands have done an

732
00:23:31.985 --> 00:23:34.818
actually these islands have done an
amazing thing over the last 300

733
00:23:34.818 --> 00:23:35.818
amazing thing over the last 300
years and achieved some fantastic

734
00:23:35.818 --> 00:23:39.443
years and achieved some fantastic
results. Yes, we have had some

735
00:23:39.443 --> 00:23:41.193
results. Yes, we have had some
mistakes too, but we have really

736
00:23:41.193 --> 00:23:43.485
mistakes too, but we have really
brought an awful lot to the world.

737
00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:45.985
brought an awful lot to the world.
We have been a fantastic force for

738
00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:47.985
We have been a fantastic force for
good over many years. And I think

739
00:23:47.985 --> 00:23:50.068
good over many years. And I think
it’s a real sadness to see that

740
00:23:50.068 --> 00:23:54.276
it’s a real sadness to see that
perhaps being thrown away. To pick

741
00:23:54.276 --> 00:23:54.443
perhaps being thrown away. To pick
“P

742
00:23:54.443 --> 00:23:58.318
perhaps being thrown away. To pick
up that point from the woman there,

743
00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:00.235
up that point from the woman there,
do you think any of the blame for

744
00:24:00.235 --> 00:24:02.485
do you think any of the blame for
this lies with Boris

745
00:24:02.485 --> 00:24:02.943
do you think any of the blame for
this lies with BorisJohnson for

746
00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:03.526
this lies with Boris johnson for
pushing

747
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:05.318
this lies with BorisJohnson for
pushing Brexit when Scotland voted

748
00:24:05.318 --> 00:24:07.818
pushing Brexit when Scotland voted
overwhelmingly to remain? We know

749
00:24:07.818 --> 00:24:11.568
overwhelmingly to remain? We know
from the last referendum in 2014

750
00:24:11.568 --> 00:24:13.318
from the last referendum in 2014
that the settled will of the

751
00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:15.151
that the settled will of the
Scottish people at the time was

752
00:24:15.151 --> 00:24:15.651
Scottish peopla at the time was
clear. I

753
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:15.901
Scottish people at the time was
clear. I am

754
00:24:15.901 --> 00:24:16.068
Scottish people at the time was
clear. lam not

755
00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:19.443
Scottish people at the time was
clear. I am not in a position...

756
00:24:19.443 --> 00:24:19.985
Scottish people at the time was
clear. lam not in a position... I

757
00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:20.860
dear. lam not in a position... I
represent a

758
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.443
clear. lam not in a position... I
represent a fantastic community in

759
00:24:21.443 --> 00:24:23.401
represent a fantastic community in
Kent, and it’s not for me to tell

760
00:24:23.401 --> 00:24:23.818
Kent, and it’s not for me to tell
the peopla

761
00:24:23.818 --> 00:24:25.318
Kent, and it’s not for me to tell
the people living here in this

762
00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:26.610
the people living here in this
wonderful part of the United Kingdom

763
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.443
wonderful part of the United Kingdom
on how they should vote or what they

764
00:24:28.443 --> 00:24:30.901
on how they should vote or what they
should do, but I listen to those

765
00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:31.901
should do, but I listen to those
peopla who

766
00:24:31.901 --> 00:24:32.985
should do, but I listen to those
people who led the referendum on

767
00:24:32.985 --> 00:24:34.360
people who led the referendum on
both sides and I heard pretty

768
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.110
both sides and I heard pretty
dearty

769
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.360
both sides and I heard pretty
clearly that it was a decision for a

770
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.693
dearty that it was a decision for a
generation.

771
00:24:38.693 --> 00:24:39.693
clearly that it was a decision for a
generation. And five years isn’t a

772
00:24:39.693 --> 00:24:45.110
generation. And five years isn’t a
generation. Alex? Tom has done his

773
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.276
generation. Alex? Tom has done his
best to dodge your question, Fiona.

774
00:24:48.276 --> 00:24:52.151
best to dodge your question, Fiona.
Did you all spot that, folks? He has

775
00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:53.985
Did you all spot that, folks? He has
done so very eloquently and

776
00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:55.318
done so very eloquently and
elegantly. The answer to the

777
00:24:55.318 --> 00:24:57.068
elegantly. The answer to the
question is that yes of course,

778
00:24:57.068 --> 00:24:58.693
question is that yes of course,
Brexit is at the heart of this. If

779
00:24:58.693 --> 00:25:01.901
Brexit is at the heart of this. If
it were not for Brexit then we would

780
00:25:01.901 --> 00:25:03.026
it were not for Brexit then we would
not be talking about this issue

781
00:25:03.026 --> 00:25:05.443
not be talking about this issue
because Brexit has put it back on

782
00:25:05.443 --> 00:25:07.401
because Brexit has put it back on
the table. If you are an SNP

783
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:07.901
the tabla. If you are an SNP
supporter, it

784
00:25:07.901 --> 00:25:09.568
the table. If you are an SNP
supporter, it has put it back on the

785
00:25:09.568 --> 00:25:10.693
supporter, it has put it back on the
table in ways that are reasonable

786
00:25:10.693 --> 00:25:11.110
table in ways that are reasonabla
and

787
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.401
table in ways that are reasonable
and persuasive and it makes for the

788
00:25:13.401 --> 00:25:14.526
and persuasive and it makes for the
kind of material change in

789
00:25:14.526 --> 00:25:16.776
kind of material change in
circumstance that would justify a

790
00:25:16.776 --> 00:25:18.485
circumstance that would justify a
second referendum. So from their

791
00:25:18.485 --> 00:25:20.401
second referendum. So from their
point of view, yes of course it is

792
00:25:20.401 --> 00:25:21.693
point of view, yes of course it is
perfectly appropriate to seek

793
00:25:21.693 --> 00:25:24.276
perfectly appropriate to seek
another referendum right now.

794
00:25:24.276 --> 00:25:26.401
another referendum right now.
Counter to that is also perfectly

795
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:27.901
Counter to that is also perfectly
respectable and persuasive, which is

796
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:28.026
respectabla and persuasive, which is
that

797
00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:30.360
respectable and persuasive, which is
that five years is not a very long

798
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.360
that five years is not a very long
time. And although Brexit may or may

799
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.318
time. And although Brexit may or may
not prove to be a terrible blunder,

800
00:25:34.318 --> 00:25:37.276
not prove to be a terrible blunder,
or perhaps a great success, who

801
00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:40.901
or perhaps a great success, who
knows! It is not long enough to

802
00:25:40.901 --> 00:25:42.193
knows! It is not long enough to
justify revisiting a question that

803
00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:44.110
justify revisiting a question that
everybody promised at the time would

804
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.068
everybody promised at the time would
be respected for years to come. So

805
00:25:47.068 --> 00:25:49.443
be respected for years to come. So
you are talking about competing

806
00:25:49.443 --> 00:25:50.901
you are talking about competing
claims of legitimacy. At present,

807
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:54.485
claims of legitimacy. At present,
and this may of course change, and

808
00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:57.610
and this may of course change, and
it is on the anti—referendum side

809
00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.276
it is on the anti-referendum side
that has

810
00:25:58.276 --> 00:26:00.568
it is on the anti—referendum side
that has the ascendancy. The SNP win

811
00:26:00.568 --> 00:26:00.735
that has the ascendancy. The SNP win
plenty

812
00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:00.901
that has the ascendancy. The SNP win
planty of

813
00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:01.735
that has the ascendancy. The SNP win
plenty of handsome election

814
00:26:01.735 --> 00:26:03.443
plenty of handsome election
victories, but it’s worth bearing in

815
00:26:03.443 --> 00:26:04.735
victories, but it’s worth bearing in
mind the calibre of the people they

816
00:26:04.735 --> 00:26:08.276
mind the calibre of the people they
beat! But that itself is not enough

817
00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:09.485
beat! But that itself is not enough
because general elections are about

818
00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:11.110
because general elections are about
a lot of different issues will stop

819
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.568
a lot of different issues will stop
but when you actually ask people,

820
00:26:13.568 --> 00:26:13.985
but when you actually ask peopla,
should

821
00:26:13.985 --> 00:26:16.026
but when you actually ask people,
should there be an independence

822
00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:17.276
should there be an independence
referendum on the timetable

823
00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:18.610
referendum on the timetable
notionally favoured by Nicola

824
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.401
notionally favoured by Nicola
Sturgeon, that is to say this year

825
00:26:20.401 --> 00:26:21.776
Sturgeon, that is to say this year
before the Holyrood elections next

826
00:26:21.776 --> 00:26:24.360
before the Holyrood elections next
year, most people say there should

827
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.901
year, most people say there should
not. The most recent YouGov poll on

828
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:31.110
not. The most recent YouGov poll on
this specific question show 30% of

829
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.610
this specific question show 3096 of
the

830
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.360
this specific question show 30% of
the SNP’s own supporters say there

831
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.776
the SNP’s own supporters say there
should not be a timetable like that.

832
00:26:36.776 --> 00:26:37.693
should not be a timetabla like that.
That’s why the

833
00:26:37.693 --> 00:26:38.651
should not be a timetable like that.
That’s why the UK Government can get

834
00:26:38.651 --> 00:26:39.776
That’s why the UK Government ran get
away with

835
00:26:39.776 --> 00:26:42.485
That’s why the UK Government can get
away with saying no for the moment.

836
00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:44.485
away with saying no for the moment.
After the 2021 Holyrood elections,

837
00:26:44.485 --> 00:26:46.526
After the 2021 Holyrood elections,
depending on the results, the line

838
00:26:46.526 --> 00:26:48.735
depending on the results, the line
could change, but it will hold for

839
00:26:48.735 --> 00:26:50.360
could change, but it will hold for
now because most people in Scotland

840
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.068
now because most peopla in Scotland
do not

841
00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:52.860
now because most people in Scotland
do not want a referendum. If 80% in

842
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:52.901
do not want a referendum. If 8096 in
Scotland

843
00:26:52.901 --> 00:26:53.901
do not want a referendum. If 80% in
Scotland wanted a referendum than it

844
00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:55.860
Scotland wanted a referendum than it
would happen but as long as the

845
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.151
would happen but as long as the
country is evenly divided then it

846
00:26:57.151 --> 00:27:04.443
country is evenly divided then it
won’t. Good evening. I would like to

847
00:27:04.443 --> 00:27:06.776
won’t. Good evening. I would like to
ask why the SNP think that Scotland

848
00:27:06.776 --> 00:27:14.401
ask why the SNP think that Scotland
would be better tied to France,

849
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:16.651
would be better tied to France,
Germany and desires to separate us

850
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:18.276
Germany and desires to separate us
from England, Wales and Ireland as a

851
00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:20.235
from England, Walas and Ireland as a
group. why do

852
00:27:20.235 --> 00:27:22.276
from England, Wales and Ireland as a
group. Why do you think we would be

853
00:27:22.276 --> 00:27:22.610
group. why do you think we would be
better off

854
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:23.401
group. Why do you think we would be
better off tied to Germany and

855
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:29.110
better off tied to Germany and
France? That’s not what we think. We

856
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.485
France? That’s not what we think. We
think Scotland would be better off

857
00:27:30.485 --> 00:27:32.651
think Scotland would be better off
as a member of the European Union.

858
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:33.860
as a member of the European Union.
We also think England would be

859
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:39.026
We also think England would be
better off as member of the European

860
00:27:39.026 --> 00:27:40.860
better off as member of the European
Union. It’s my dearest wish to see

861
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.151
Union. It’s my dearest wish to see
England come back to the EU and sit

862
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:44.443
England come back to the EU and sit
at the top table alongside an

863
00:27:44.443 --> 00:27:47.026
at the top table alongside an
independent Scotland. What you are

864
00:27:47.026 --> 00:27:47.401
independent Scotland. what you are
dearty asking

865
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:48.610
independent Scotland. What you are
clearly asking is why do you want to

866
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.068
dearty asking is why do you want to
separate from

867
00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:50.026
clearly asking is why do you want to
separate from the rest of the UK

868
00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:52.360
separate from the rest of the UK
when you want to join the EU. We

869
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.193
when you want tojoin the EU. We
don’t

870
00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:54.485
when you want to join the EU. We
don’t want to separate from the rest

871
00:27:54.485 --> 00:27:58.026
don’t want to separate from the rest
of the UK... New kind of implied

872
00:27:58.026 --> 00:28:03.985
of the UK... New kind of implied
that though. You want to stay part

873
00:28:03.985 --> 00:28:09.276
that though. You want to stay part
of the UK? No, we want to exercise

874
00:28:09.276 --> 00:28:10.693
of the UK? No, we want to exercise
our right to self—determination and

875
00:28:10.693 --> 00:28:11.068
our right to self-determination and
become

876
00:28:11.068 --> 00:28:12.235
our right to self—determination and
become an independent country. That

877
00:28:12.235 --> 00:28:14.693
become an independent country. That
doesn’t have to involve separation.

878
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.318
doesn’t have to involve separation.
We are not leaving something to stop

879
00:28:16.318 --> 00:28:18.776
We are not leaving something to stop
the United Kingdom is a union of two

880
00:28:18.776 --> 00:28:21.318
the United Kingdom is a union of two
nations, Scotland and England. And

881
00:28:21.318 --> 00:28:24.443
nations, Scotland and England. And
the Welsh and the Northern Irish?

882
00:28:24.443 --> 00:28:27.443
the Welsh and the Northern Irish?
The act of Union was a union between

883
00:28:27.443 --> 00:28:28.860
The act of Union was a union between
Scotland and England. If Scotland

884
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.276
Scotland and England. If Scotland
wishes to withdraw from that union

885
00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:32.651
wishes to withdraw from that union
then there will no longer be United

886
00:28:32.651 --> 00:28:34.276
then there will no longer be United
Kingdom in a way we understand. So

887
00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:37.360
Kingdom in a way we understand. So
you will have left. The reason we

888
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.110
you will have left. The reason we
want to remain part of the EU is we

889
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.443
want to remain part of the EU is we
see Scotland’s future in the EU.

890
00:28:42.443 --> 00:28:45.401
see Scotland’s future in the EU.
Otherwise Scotland’s future is tied

891
00:28:45.401 --> 00:28:47.651
Otherwise Scotland’s future is tied
to England, completely at the whim

892
00:28:47.651 --> 00:28:49.485
to England, completely at the whim
of what English voters choose. And

893
00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:53.276
of what English voters choose. And
that cannot be right. I wish you

894
00:28:53.276 --> 00:28:57.235
that cannot be right. I wish you
would stop interrupting me. A union

895
00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:59.151
would stop interrupting me. A union
cannot be a hostage situation. And

896
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:01.860
cannot be a hostage situation. And
that is rapidly what this union is

897
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.693
that is rapidly what this union is
becoming because Scotland is facing

898
00:29:03.693 --> 00:29:06.485
becoming because Scotland is facing
board is being set up on either side

899
00:29:06.485 --> 00:29:08.068
board is being set up on either side
of our country, a border with

900
00:29:08.068 --> 00:29:09.026
of our country, a border with
Northern Ireland thanks to the

901
00:29:09.026 --> 00:29:11.026
Northern Ireland thanks to the
agreement that has been reached, and

902
00:29:11.026 --> 00:29:13.401
agreement that has been reached, and
a border with the European Union.

903
00:29:13.401 --> 00:29:13.568
a border with the European Union.
Why

904
00:29:13.568 --> 00:29:14.360
a border with the European Union.
why do you

905
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.068
a border with the European Union.
Why do you prefer the European

906
00:29:15.068 --> 00:29:15.443
why do you prefer the European
Union, that

907
00:29:15.443 --> 00:29:20.818
Why do you prefer the European
Union, that is the question. We

908
00:29:20.818 --> 00:29:23.110
Union, that is the question. We
prefer it because the EU is a union

909
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.693
prefer it because the EU is a union
of equals. In the EU, if a small

910
00:29:25.693 --> 00:29:27.443
of equals. In the EU, if a small
country like Ireland has concerns

911
00:29:27.443 --> 00:29:29.151
country like Ireland has concerns
then those concerns are heard with

912
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:31.818
then those concerns are heard with
as much weight at the top table as

913
00:29:31.818 --> 00:29:33.985
as much weight at the top table as
the concerns of France or Germany.

914
00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:35.901
the concerns of France or Germany.
We saw that in the Brexit process

915
00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:37.818
We saw that in the Brexit process
will stop contrast that with the way

916
00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:39.026
will stop contrast that with the way
Scotland was treated during the

917
00:29:39.026 --> 00:29:41.110
Scotland was treated during the
Brexit process when none of our

918
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.943
Brexit process when none of our
concerns were taken on board. 50 we

919
00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:45.026
concerns were taken on board. So we
prefer a union of

920
00:29:45.026 --> 00:29:46.151
concerns were taken on board. 50 we
prefer a union of equals as opposed

921
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:49.193
prefer a union of equals as opposed
to a union of unequal is. Many

922
00:29:49.193 --> 00:29:49.818
to a union of unequal is. Many
peopla don’t

923
00:29:49.818 --> 00:29:50.860
to a union of unequal is. Many
people don’t see this as a hostage

924
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.651
people don’t see this as a hostage
situation. APPLAUSE

925
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:58.693
situation. APPLAUSE
INAUDIBLE

926
00:30:00.693 --> 00:30:02.901
INAUDIBLE
On that last point, it is not a

927
00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:04.568
On that last point, it is not a
binary, it is not to be either part

928
00:30:04.568 --> 00:30:07.860
binary, it is not to be either part
of the UK or the EU. First of all,

929
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.526
of the UK or the EU. First of all,
what we have to do, if we so choose,

930
00:30:10.526 --> 00:30:12.693
what we have to do, if we so choose,
the people of Scotland, if we decide

931
00:30:12.693 --> 00:30:14.360
the people of Scotland, if we decide
to become an independent nation,

932
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.401
to become an independent nation,
then at that point we decide whether

933
00:30:16.401 --> 00:30:18.110
then at that point we decide whether
or not being part of the European

934
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.401
or not being part of the European
Union is what is in our best

935
00:30:20.401 --> 00:30:22.235
Union is what is in our best
interest. I am a passionate

936
00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:22.568
interest. lam a passionate
Europhile

937
00:30:22.568 --> 00:30:23.901
interest. I am a passionate
Europhile and right now I would love

938
00:30:23.901 --> 00:30:26.360
Europhile and right now I would love
us to be back in the EU. But that by

939
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.110
us to be back in the EU. But that by
the time we gain independence which

940
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.693
the time we gain independence which
might be next year, a few years down

941
00:30:30.693 --> 00:30:32.110
might be next year, a few years down
the road, whenever, it might not be

942
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:37.860
the road, whenever, it might not be
the next best option. It’s not an

943
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.110
the next best option. It’s not an
either or decision. It’s about

944
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.901
either or decision. It’s about
Scotland making decisions for itself

945
00:30:41.901 --> 00:30:43.526
Scotland making decisions for itself
as an independent nation to stop and

946
00:30:43.526 --> 00:30:45.318
as an independent nation to stop and
to ask Ian, what would a mandate

947
00:30:45.318 --> 00:30:50.651
to ask Ian, what would a mandate
look like? To answer that question

948
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:52.401
look like? To answer that question
directly, a mandate does not look

949
00:30:52.401 --> 00:30:54.443
directly, a mandate does not look
like 4596, as

950
00:30:54.443 --> 00:30:55.693
directly, a mandate does not look
like 45%, as we had on December 12.

951
00:30:55.693 --> 00:30:57.443
like 4596, as we had on December 12.
john Curtice, the

952
00:30:57.443 --> 00:30:58.943
like 45%, as we had on December 12.
John Curtice, the UK’s most eminent

953
00:30:58.943 --> 00:30:59.651
john Curtice, the UK’s most eminent
pollster, said

954
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:00.443
John Curtice, the UK’s most eminent
pollster, said you couldn’t

955
00:31:00.443 --> 00:31:02.735
pollster, said you couldn’t
extrapolate a mandate from December

956
00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:04.485
extrapolate a mandate from December
12. A mandate according to Nicola

957
00:31:04.485 --> 00:31:05.193
12. A mandate according to Nicola
Sturgeon 18

958
00:31:05.193 --> 00:31:05.901
12. A mandate according to Nicole
Sturgeon 18 months ago

959
00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:06.151
12. A mandate according to Nicola
Sturgeon 18 months ago was

960
00:31:06.151 --> 00:31:08.235
Sturgeon 18 months ago was
consistent at 60% in the polls. What

961
00:31:08.235 --> 00:31:08.651
consistent at 6096 in the polls. what
is

962
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:09.943
consistent at 60% in the polls. What
is remarkable in this whole debate

963
00:31:09.943 --> 00:31:10.860
is remarkabla in this whola debate
is that

964
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.526
is remarkable in this whole debate
is that the SNP have existed for

965
00:31:12.526 --> 00:31:13.276
is that the SNP have existed for
nearty 70 or

966
00:31:13.276 --> 00:31:14.318
is that the SNP have existed for
nearly 70 or 80 years and still

967
00:31:14.318 --> 00:31:14.901
hearty 70 or 80 years and still
can’t

968
00:31:14.901 --> 00:31:16.818
nearly 70 or 80 years and still
can’t answer that Lady’s question

969
00:31:16.818 --> 00:31:16.901
can’t answer that ladrs question
and

970
00:31:16.901 --> 00:31:17.235
can’t answer that [5de question
and still

971
00:31:17.235 --> 00:31:18.693
can’t answer that Lady’s question
and still can’t answer questions

972
00:31:18.693 --> 00:31:20.901
and still can’t answer questions
about currency and questions about

973
00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:22.943
about currency and questions about
borders and questions about how we

974
00:31:22.943 --> 00:31:25.985
borders and questions about how we
fulfil the deficit. We can sit and

975
00:31:25.985 --> 00:31:26.193
fulfil the deficit. We ran sit and
talk

976
00:31:26.193 --> 00:31:27.110
fulfil the deficit. We can sit and
talk about mandates but when will

977
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.610
talk about mandates but when will
you get onto the big issues about

978
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.151
you get onto the big issues about
what would we need to do and the

979
00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:31.360
what would we need to do and the
arguments around what you want to

980
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.151
arguments around what you want to
see. ALL TALK AT ONCE

981
00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:45.610
see. ALL TALK AT ONCE
Hang on! You two are having a

982
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.318
Hang on! You two are having a
private conversation of a stop it is

983
00:31:47.318 --> 00:31:48.735
private conversation of a stop it is
fascinating but there are a lot of

984
00:31:48.735 --> 00:31:50.026
fascinating but there are a lot of
us that need to hear what’s going

985
00:31:50.026 --> 00:31:50.860
us that need to hear what’s going
on.

986
00:31:56.485 --> 00:31:58.943
You are talking about opinion polls
and I’m talking about the mandates

987
00:31:58.943 --> 00:32:02.235
and I’m talking about the mandates
of when people go to the ballot box.

988
00:32:02.235 --> 00:32:02.443
of when peopla go to the ballot box.
4595

989
00:32:02.443 --> 00:32:02.735
of when peopla go to the ballot box.
4596 isn’t

990
00:32:02.735 --> 00:32:05.443
of when people go to the ballot box.
45% isn’t a mandate. It is a

991
00:32:05.443 --> 00:32:08.235
45% isn’t a mandate. It is a
mandate. The authority of MSPs is

992
00:32:08.235 --> 00:32:12.235
mandate. The authority of MSPs is
surely a mandate. There are lots of

993
00:32:12.235 --> 00:32:16.318
surely a mandate. There are lots of
hands up... Thank you. There are

994
00:32:16.318 --> 00:32:18.401
hands up... Thank you. There are
lots of hands up and let’s hear from

995
00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:20.735
lots of hands up and let’s hear from
somebody. In the red T—shirt at the

996
00:32:20.735 --> 00:32:23.901
somebody. In the red T-shirt at the
front. Currency

997
00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:24.401
somebody. In the red T—shirt at the
front. Currency and borders,

998
00:32:24.401 --> 00:32:28.318
front. Currency and borders,
Scotland voted twice to stay in the

999
00:32:28.318 --> 00:32:32.026
Scotland voted twice to stay in the
EU and avoid borders, and if England

1000
00:32:32.026 --> 00:32:36.485
EU and avoid borders, and if England
voted to leave, borders are on

1001
00:32:36.485 --> 00:32:38.151
voted to leave, borders are on
England’s fault, not Scotland’s. We

1002
00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:42.401
England’s fault, not Scotland’s. We
have a functional economy and we can

1003
00:32:42.401 --> 00:32:42.818
have a functional economy and we ran
have our

1004
00:32:42.818 --> 00:32:44.193
have a functional economy and we can
have our own country if we choose to

1005
00:32:44.193 --> 00:32:46.110
have our own country if we choose to
have one, but when it comes to the

1006
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.776
have one, but when it comes to the
union, it doesn’t matter. You will

1007
00:32:49.776 --> 00:32:50.818
union, it doesn’t matter. You will
have a functioning currency. It’s

1008
00:32:50.818 --> 00:32:54.276
have a functioning currency. It’s
not hard to figure out. If there is

1009
00:32:54.276 --> 00:32:55.985
not hard to figure out. If there is
one thing we have learnt from the

1010
00:32:55.985 --> 00:32:57.526
one thing we have learnt from the
Brexit process is that division

1011
00:32:57.526 --> 00:33:03.693
Brexit process is that division
doesn’t dry progress. We have been

1012
00:33:03.693 --> 00:33:05.568
doesn’t dry progress. We have been
told now independence, and it’s time

1013
00:33:05.568 --> 00:33:10.776
told now independence, and it’s time
to stop debating it, and we need to

1014
00:33:10.776 --> 00:33:12.193
to stop debating it, and we need to
solve hydro deaths and other things,

1015
00:33:12.193 --> 00:33:13.401
solve hydro deaths and other things,
because we need to discuss these

1016
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:16.901
because we need to discuss these
things instead of independence. The

1017
00:33:16.901 --> 00:33:22.485
things instead of independence. The
man in the T—shirt.

1018
00:33:22.568 --> 00:33:22.901
man in the T—shirt. Actually, sorry,

1019
00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:23.526
man in the T-shirt. Actually, sorry,
the young man

1020
00:33:23.526 --> 00:33:25.651
man in the T—shirt. Actually, sorry,
the young man behind you. I think

1021
00:33:25.651 --> 00:33:31.610
the young man behind you. I think
it’s quite rich

1022
00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:35.151
it’s quite rich to have, before
Brexit, a lot of people said, we

1023
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:38.901
Brexit, a lot of people said, we
need another referendum on the EU,

1024
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:41.568
need another referendum on the EU,
but they said with the same phase,

1025
00:33:41.568 --> 00:33:42.860
but they said with the same phase,
we can’t have another referendum on

1026
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.735
we can’t have another referendum on
Scottish independence. That’s why

1027
00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:48.401
Scottish independence. That’s why
the second EU referendum was a

1028
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:49.610
the second EU referendum was a
stupid idea, from a Scottish

1029
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.943
stupid idea, from a Scottish
perspective. We are basically at the

1030
00:33:53.943 --> 00:33:56.401
perspective. We are basically at the
whim of the English Parliament, so

1031
00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:58.110
whim of the English Parliament, so
will they abstain from any boats

1032
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.610
will they abstain from any boats
that just

1033
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.776
will they abstain from any boats
thatjust involve

1034
00:33:58.776 --> 00:33:58.943
will they abstain from any boats
that just involve the

1035
00:33:58.943 --> 00:34:01.151
will they abstain from any boats
thatjust involve the English? Say

1036
00:34:01.151 --> 00:34:04.110
that just involve the English? Say
that again?

1037
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.401
thatjust involve the English? Say
that again? The SNP say they are at

1038
00:34:05.401 --> 00:34:11.193
that again? The SNP say they are at
the whim of the English Parliament,

1039
00:34:11.193 --> 00:34:11.776
the whim of the English Partiament,
but they take

1040
00:34:11.776 --> 00:34:13.276
the whim of the English Parliament,
but they take part in votes which

1041
00:34:13.276 --> 00:34:17.776
but they take part in votes which
only concern legislation in England.

1042
00:34:17.776 --> 00:34:18.193
only concern lagislation in England.
English votes

1043
00:34:18.193 --> 00:34:21.985
only concern legislation in England.
English votes for English laws? It

1044
00:34:21.985 --> 00:34:23.443
English votes for English laws? It
is a UK Parliament. The woman with

1045
00:34:23.443 --> 00:34:23.818
is a UK Partiament. The woman with
the blonde

1046
00:34:23.818 --> 00:34:28.818
is a UK Parliament. The woman with
the blonde hair.

1047
00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:34.901
the blonde hair. That Scotland voted
to stay in in 2014 is very different

1048
00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:36.651
to stay in in 2014 is very different
to now, but until Brexit is done,

1049
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:39.360
to now, but until Brexit is done,
and we know what UK we are staying

1050
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.360
and we know what UK we are staying
in? Surely we need to wait and see

1051
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.901
in? Surely we need to wait and see
what happens and then possibly

1052
00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:46.276
what happens and then possibly
consider allowing another red

1053
00:34:46.276 --> 00:34:47.110
consider allowing another red
independence —— independence

1054
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:53.193
independence —— independence
referendum. I think it’s rich to

1055
00:34:53.193 --> 00:34:54.943
referendum. I think it’s rich to
claim that you don’t want to leave

1056
00:34:54.943 --> 00:34:56.193
claim that you don’t want to leave
because of borders, when that wasn’t

1057
00:34:56.193 --> 00:34:56.610
because of borders, when that wasn’t
the rase

1058
00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:01.693
because of borders, when that wasn’t
the case with the EU. We have not

1059
00:35:01.693 --> 00:35:02.068
the use with the EU. We have not
negotiated a

1060
00:35:02.068 --> 00:35:04.526
the case with the EU. We have not
negotiated a deal yet. It hasn’t

1061
00:35:04.526 --> 00:35:05.485
negotiated a deal yet. It hasn’t
been approved and ratified through

1062
00:35:05.485 --> 00:35:11.235
been approved and ratified through
both parliaments. But we deserve

1063
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:11.485
both partiaments. But we deserve
answers

1064
00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:12.443
both parliaments. But we deserve
answers to those questions and we

1065
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:17.901
answers to those questions and we
didn’t get them.

1066
00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:23.901
didn’t get them. The woman in the
black sweater. When I was at school,

1067
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:24.735
black sweater. when I was at school,
4595

1068
00:35:24.735 --> 00:35:28.526
black sweater. When I was at school,
45% meant there was 55% on the other

1069
00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:28.901
4596 meant there was 5596 on the other
side, and

1070
00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:32.610
45% meant there was 55% on the other
side, and 55% of voters voted not

1071
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.193
side, and 5596 of voters voted not
for the SNP,

1072
00:35:33.193 --> 00:35:34.276
side, and 55% of voters voted not
for the SNP, so surely that does not

1073
00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:38.443
for the SNP, so surely that does not
give them a mandate. Because there

1074
00:35:38.443 --> 00:35:40.568
give them a mandate. Because there
is a percentage of don’t knows, so

1075
00:35:40.568 --> 00:35:41.776
is a percentage of don’t knows, so
that might not have applied at

1076
00:35:41.776 --> 00:35:44.651
that might not have applied at
school, I don’t know. At the heart

1077
00:35:44.651 --> 00:35:46.901
school, I don’t know. At the heart
of this is a question of how you

1078
00:35:46.901 --> 00:35:49.276
of this is a question of how you
think about Scotland’s future and

1079
00:35:49.276 --> 00:35:50.651
think about Scotland’s future and
how you feel about it. At the

1080
00:35:50.651 --> 00:35:55.276
how you feel about it. At the
moment, in terms of cost benefit

1081
00:35:55.276 --> 00:35:57.526
moment, in terms of cost benefit
analysis, unionism has the upper

1082
00:35:57.526 --> 00:35:59.526
analysis, unionism has the upper
hand in terms of financial,

1083
00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:00.526
hand in terms of financial,
technical and practical aspects of

1084
00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:01.901
technical and practical aspects of
independence that have been made

1085
00:36:01.901 --> 00:36:04.610
independence that have been made
complicated and made more difficult

1086
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.401
complicated and made more difficult
by Brexit but, in terms of how you

1087
00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:08.401
by Brexit but, in terms of how you
feel, the calculation is changing

1088
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:08.610
feel, the ralmlation is changing
there

1089
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.235
feel, the calculation is changing
there as well. I think it seems to

1090
00:36:12.235 --> 00:36:13.776
there as well. I think it seems to
me there that the SNP and

1091
00:36:13.776 --> 00:36:15.610
me there that the SNP and
pro—independence forces have the

1092
00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:16.401
pro-independence forces have the
upper hand,

1093
00:36:16.401 --> 00:36:17.068
pro—independence forces have the
upper hand, and opinion polling

1094
00:36:17.068 --> 00:36:18.443
upper hand, and opinion polling
demonstrates that. If you look at

1095
00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:21.693
demonstrates that. If you look at
the views of people under the age of

1096
00:36:21.693 --> 00:36:21.776
the views of people under the age of
50.

1097
00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:25.776
the views of people under the age of
50, .60, 65% now saying they support

1098
00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:25.901
50, .60, 6596 now saying they support
independence,

1099
00:36:25.901 --> 00:36:26.568
50, .60, 65% now saying they support
independence, and that’s getting

1100
00:36:26.568 --> 00:36:27.943
independence, and that’s getting
quite close to the settled will of

1101
00:36:27.943 --> 00:36:30.943
quite close to the settled will of
the Scottish people —type territory.

1102
00:36:30.943 --> 00:36:31.068
the Scottish peopla -type territory.
The

1103
00:36:31.068 --> 00:36:31.360
the Scottish people -type territory.
The problem

1104
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.151
the Scottish people —type territory.
The problem for unionism is that the

1105
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:33.860
The problem for unionism is that the
9’P

1106
00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.901
The problem for unionism is that the
gap on what you think, the

1107
00:36:35.901 --> 00:36:37.318
gap on what you think, the
hard—headed calculation, has been

1108
00:36:37.318 --> 00:36:37.526
hard-headed ralmlation, has been
narrowing,

1109
00:36:37.526 --> 00:36:38.651
hard—headed calculation, has been
narrowing, while the gap on the how

1110
00:36:38.651 --> 00:36:39.776
narrowing, whila the gap on the how
do you feel has

1111
00:36:39.776 --> 00:36:42.818
narrowing, while the gap on the how
do you feel has been widening, and

1112
00:36:42.818 --> 00:36:45.235
do you feel has been widening, and
in neither case is the direction of

1113
00:36:45.235 --> 00:36:45.568
in neither use is the direction of
travel working

1114
00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:47.943
in neither case is the direction of
travel working in unionism’s favour.

1115
00:36:47.943 --> 00:36:50.485
travel working in unionism’s favour.
Unless it finds ways to address

1116
00:36:50.485 --> 00:36:53.318
Unless it finds ways to address
that, unionism has a long—term

1117
00:36:53.318 --> 00:36:53.735
that, unionism has a long-term
problam, a

1118
00:36:53.735 --> 00:36:54.401
that, unionism has a long—term
problem, a medium—term problem and

1119
00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:54.943
problam, a medium-term problem and
quite possibly a

1120
00:36:54.943 --> 00:36:58.068
problem, a medium—term problem and
quite possibly a problem as well.

1121
00:36:58.068 --> 00:37:00.110
quite possibly a problem as well.
Has your position change on this in

1122
00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:07.360
Has your position change on this in
terms of the head versus the heart?

1123
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.485
terms of the head versus the heart?
I swivelled for a long time, on the

1124
00:37:09.485 --> 00:37:12.985
I swivelled for a long time, on the
one hand, on the other hand, and you

1125
00:37:12.985 --> 00:37:15.276
one hand, on the other hand, and you
ask questions and neither side could

1126
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:16.735
ask questions and neither side could
give me a coherent answer. Really,

1127
00:37:16.735 --> 00:37:18.651
give me a coherent answer. Really,
the basis on which I made my

1128
00:37:18.651 --> 00:37:20.318
the basis on which I made my
decision then, and I think it’s the

1129
00:37:20.318 --> 00:37:23.610
decision then, and I think it’s the
same now, is I looked at what the

1130
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.151
same now, is I looked at what the
Scottish Parliament, not

1131
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:25.901
same now, is I looked at what the
Scottish Parliament, notjust the

1132
00:37:25.901 --> 00:37:26.401
Scottish Partiament, not just the
SNP at

1133
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:27.735
Scottish Parliament, notjust the
SNP at the Parliament in Scotland

1134
00:37:27.735 --> 00:37:28.318
SNP at the Partiament in Scotland
had

1135
00:37:28.318 --> 00:37:30.151
SNP at the Parliament in Scotland
had done since Holyrood began in

1136
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:31.818
had done since Holyrood began in
1999, and I looked at what

1137
00:37:31.818 --> 00:37:33.443
1999, and I looked at what
Westminster had done in that same

1138
00:37:33.443 --> 00:37:36.776
Westminster had done in that same
time period, and I knew where my

1139
00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:38.360
time period, and I knew where my
heart lay and it was the same place

1140
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.193
heart lay and it was the same place
as my head laid, that what was best

1141
00:37:40.193 --> 00:37:43.985
as my head laid, that what was best
for the people of Scotland, they

1142
00:37:43.985 --> 00:37:44.235
for the peopla of Scotland, they
have

1143
00:37:44.235 --> 00:37:45.401
for the people of Scotland, they
have been better served by what has

1144
00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:47.568
have been better served by what has
been done in their Parliament and

1145
00:37:47.568 --> 00:37:48.151
been done in their Partiament and
the country as

1146
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:49.318
been done in their Parliament and
the country as a whole, and that was

1147
00:37:49.318 --> 00:37:50.735
the country as a whole, and that was
the basis on which I made my

1148
00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:50.901
the basis on which I made my
decision.

1149
00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:55.943
decision.

I have a feeling this is a topic we

I have a feeling this is a topic we

1153

will be discussing for quite some
time, actually, over the next

because we had a lot of questions,

1175
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:42.151

and it surprisingly, on this next

1176
00:38:42.151 --> 00:38:44.318
and it surprisingly, on this next
issue. Tracey Colville, where are

1177
00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:48.901
issue. Tracey Colville, where are
you? Is a bridge to Ireland a bridge

1178
00:38:48.901 --> 00:38:49.443
you? Is a bridge to Ireland a bridge
too far?

1179
00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:53.901
too far?
LAUGHTER

1180
00:38:53.901 --> 00:38:57.901
LAUGHTER
Well, Ian? It’s a great

1181
00:38:57.901 --> 00:38:58.110
MUGHTER
Well, Ian? It’s a great question,

1182
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.776
Well, Ian? It’s a great question,
and is this another one of Boris’s

1183
00:39:00.776 --> 00:39:01.485
and is this another one of Boris’s
fantasy

1184
00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:02.235
and is this another one of Boris’s
fantasy projects, like the island

1185
00:39:02.235 --> 00:39:03.443
fantasy projects, like the island
airport and everything else he has

1186
00:39:03.443 --> 00:39:03.818
airport and everything else he has
come out

1187
00:39:03.818 --> 00:39:08.110
airport and everything else he has
come outwith? He mentioned this

1188
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:08.443
come out with? He mentioned this
eartier

1189
00:39:08.443 --> 00:39:10.318
come outwith? He mentioned this
earlier this week, in terms of H52,

1190
00:39:10.318 --> 00:39:10.735
eartier this week, in terms of H52,
but what

1191
00:39:10.735 --> 00:39:13.401
earlier this week, in terms of H52,
but what about a bridge to Ireland?

1192
00:39:13.401 --> 00:39:14.485
but what about a bridge to Ireland?
Lets look at the feasibility,

1193
00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:17.485
Lets look at the feasibility,
because it brings countries

1194
00:39:17.485 --> 00:39:19.526
because it brings countries
together, it would be economically

1195
00:39:19.526 --> 00:39:20.901
together, it would be economically
wonderful, but I don’t have any

1196
00:39:20.901 --> 00:39:22.318
wonderful, but I don’t have any
confidence any government could

1197
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:23.110
confidence any government could
deliver these big infrastructure

1198
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.526
deliver these big infrastmclure
projects on

1199
00:39:23.526 --> 00:39:24.943
deliver these big infrastructure
projects on time and on budget

1200
00:39:24.943 --> 00:39:29.068
projects on time and on budget I
think it’s a great way of connecting

1201
00:39:29.068 --> 00:39:30.943
think it’s a great way of connecting
Ireland with Scotland and we should

1202
00:39:30.943 --> 00:39:32.818
Ireland with Scotland and we should
look at it, but we have a

1203
00:39:32.818 --> 00:39:33.110
Ireland with Scotland and we should
look at it, but we have 3 Prime

1204
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:33.193
look at it, but we have a Prime
Minister

1205
00:39:33.193 --> 00:39:34.818
look at it, but we have 3 Prime
Minister who has spent the last

1206
00:39:34.818 --> 00:39:35.985
Minister who has spent the last
three years building walls and now

1207
00:39:35.985 --> 00:39:37.110
three years building walls and now
he wants to start building bridges,

1208
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.151
he wants to start building bridges,
so I think it’s a bit rich of him to

1209
00:39:39.151 --> 00:39:39.401
so I think it’s a bit rich of him to
55V

1210
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:42.443
so I think it’s a bit rich of him to
say he was to connect himself in.

1211
00:39:42.443 --> 00:39:44.026
say he was to connect himself in.
But you are saying we should look at

1212
00:39:44.026 --> 00:39:46.901
But you are saying we should look at
this? of

1213
00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:48.151
But you are saying we should look at
this? Of course, because if it

1214
00:39:48.151 --> 00:39:49.485
this? Of course, because if it
sensible and feasible... I don’t

1215
00:39:49.485 --> 00:39:51.151
sensible and feasible... I don’t
think it is, because civil engineers

1216
00:39:51.151 --> 00:39:53.735
think it is, because civil engineers
have said the water is too deep and

1217
00:39:53.735 --> 00:39:55.110
have said the water is too deep and
rough, you couldn’t do it, but if

1218
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.151
rough, you couldn’t do it, but if
the government wants to look at a

1219
00:39:57.151 --> 00:39:58.360
the government wants to look at a
feasibility study, and its

1220
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.401
feasibility study, and its
deliverable, then fine. But I think

1221
00:40:00.401 --> 00:40:01.901
deliverable, then fine. But I think
it’s maybe another one of Boris’s

1222
00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:07.901
it’s maybe another one of Boris’s
fantasy projects. Is it, Tom? In

1223
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:10.485
fantasy projects. Is it, Tom? In
2012, an architect came up with the

1224
00:40:10.485 --> 00:40:12.568
2012, an architect came up with the
idea, and the SNP welcomed it as a

1225
00:40:12.568 --> 00:40:14.110
idea, and the SNP welcomed it as a
link between Scotland and Ireland,

1226
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.943
link between Scotland and Ireland,
and now they are against it because

1227
00:40:15.943 --> 00:40:17.943
and now they are against it because
it is Boris’s idea. I think

1228
00:40:17.943 --> 00:40:18.110
it is Boris’s idea. Ithink
connecting

1229
00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.818
it is Boris’s idea. I think
connecting parts of this country

1230
00:40:19.818 --> 00:40:21.568
connecting parts of this country
together is something we should look

1231
00:40:21.568 --> 00:40:24.901
together is something we should look

peopla were

1236

Eurotunnel project, and that has

1238

Eurotunnel project, and that has
added enormously to all communities,

00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:37.818
added enormously to all communities,

look, the Chinese have built bridges

1253
00:41:03.735 --> 00:41:05.485
look, the Chinese have built bridges
longer than that. Whether they have

built them in such difficult
circumstances, I am not qualified to

1257

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if there

1299
00:42:22.026 --> 00:42:26.818
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if there
was a link for Irish trains to come

1300
00:42:26.818 --> 00:42:27.485

pots in the south, and go direct to

1302
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:33.985
pots in the south, and go direct to
the continent? Remember, when

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:37.110
the continent? Remember, when
Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, the

1304

Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, the
great bulk of their trade was with

great bulk of their trade was with
England. Now, the balance has

changed and a significant amount is

success? It starts from a small

1340
00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:52.193
success? It starts from a small
seed, and it grows. We built the

1341
00:43:52.193 --> 00:43:54.568

Skye bridge many years ago. We can

build

1343

Skye bridge many years ago. We can
build engineering projects, we have

1344
00:43:55.901 --> 00:43:57.901

be positive about what we ran do,
not go by

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.276
be positive about what we ran do,
not so by party

1349
00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:05.860
be positive about what we can do,
not go by party political points, by

1350
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.651
not go by party political points, by
criticising Boris

1351
00:44:06.651 --> 00:44:07.901
not go by party political points, by
criticising Borisjohnson, because

1352

criticising Boris johnson, because
if it was any

00:44:08.568 --> 00:44:10.193
criticising Borisjohnson, because
if it was any other politician on

if it was any other politician on
each of the individual parties they

1355
00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.651
each of the individual parties they
would be supporting their own

1356
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:17.860
would be supporting their own
leader. So let’s be positive about

1357
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:18.860
leader. So let’s be positive about
the engineering projects that we

1358

00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:20.193
where the musicians are, they
regularty

1385
00:45:20.193 --> 00:45:22.318
where the musicians are, they
regularly wash up on beaches on the

1386
00:45:22.318 --> 00:45:22.693
regularty wash up on beaches on the
Ayrshire coast.

1387
00:45:22.693 --> 00:45:23.568
regularly wash up on beaches on the
Ayrshire coast. I’m not happy about

1388
00:45:23.568 --> 00:45:25.901
Ayrshire coast. I’m not happy about
driving over a bridge in a storm

1389
00:45:25.901 --> 00:45:28.693
driving over a bridge in a storm
that’s built on a munitions dump!

1390
00:45:28.693 --> 00:45:31.735
that’s built on a munitions dump!
Apparently there’s about a million

1391
00:45:31.735 --> 00:45:32.943
Apparently there’s about a million
tonnes of is discarded after the

1392
00:45:32.943 --> 00:45:34.318
tonnes of is discarded after the
Second World War, and they are in

1393
00:45:34.318 --> 00:45:36.693
Second World War, and they are in
Beaufort Dyke in the Irish Sea.

1394
00:45:36.693 --> 00:45:37.318
Second World War, and they are in
Beaufort Dyke in the Irish See. It

1395
00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:38.735
Beaufort Dyke in the Irish Sea. It
certainly makes for an interesting

1396
00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:42.526
certainly makes for an interesting
journey! Alex? I disagree with the

1397
00:45:42.526 --> 00:45:43.860
journey! Alex? I disagree with the
gentleman who said, if it was any

1398
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.818
gentleman who said, if it was any
other politician, we would be

1399
00:45:45.818 --> 00:45:47.443
other politician, we would be
treating this more seriously. I

1400
00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:49.318
treating this more seriously. I
wouldn’t, and if any other

1401
00:45:49.318 --> 00:45:51.610
wouldn’t, and if any other
politician had proposed this I would

1402
00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.526
politician had proposed this I would
still say it’s a nonsense, and a

1403
00:45:53.526 --> 00:45:54.401
still say it’s a nonsense, and a
nonsense which has almost zero

1404
00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:56.818
nonsense which has almost zero
chance of happening. You might as

1405
00:45:56.818 --> 00:45:58.485
chance of happening. You might as
well propose to build a bridge to

1406
00:45:58.485 --> 00:46:00.651
well propose to build a bridge to
Norway while we are at it. Don’t

1407
00:46:00.651 --> 00:46:03.860
Norway whila we are at it. Don’t
forget that

1408
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.860
Norway while we are at it. Don’t
forget that Eurotunnel was, for many

1409
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.360
forget that Eurotunnel was, for many
79575-

1410
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.443
forget that Eurotunnel was, for many
years, derided as a ludicrous idea.

1411
00:46:07.443 --> 00:46:09.610
years, derided as a ludicrous idea.
People had been talking about that

1412
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.985
People had been talking about that
for hundreds of years, Napoleon had

1413
00:46:10.985 --> 00:46:11.943
for hundreds of years, Napolaon had
a plan to build

1414
00:46:11.943 --> 00:46:12.776
for hundreds of years, Napoleon had
a plan to build a tunnel under the

1415
00:46:12.776 --> 00:46:16.360
a plan to build a tunnel under the
English Channel. It’s also somebody

1416
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.985
English Channel. It’s also somebody
that nobody apart from I think

1417
00:46:17.985 --> 00:46:18.235
that nobody apart from I think
Ariana

1418
00:46:18.235 --> 00:46:18.985
that nobody apart from I think
Arlene Foster actually wants. Even

1419
00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:19.485
Ariana Foster actually wants. Even
if it

1420
00:46:19.485 --> 00:46:21.901
Arlene Foster actually wants. Even
if it were built, and Val McDermid

1421
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:23.193
if it were built, and Val McDermid
rates the right points about the

1422
00:46:23.193 --> 00:46:25.901
rates the right points about the
difficulty, it will take at least 30

1423
00:46:25.901 --> 00:46:28.818
difficulty, it will take at least 30
years to do it, by which time plenty

1424
00:46:28.818 --> 00:46:29.276
years to do it, by which time planty
of

1425
00:46:29.276 --> 00:46:30.651
years to do it, by which time plenty
of the people here tonight will have

1426
00:46:30.651 --> 00:46:31.651
of the people here tonight will have
little opportunity to use it.

1427
00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:36.651
little opportunity to use it.
LAUGHTER

1428
00:46:40.151 --> 00:46:42.443
LAUGHTER
FACE BIG OVER EACH OTHER.

1429
00:46:42.443 --> 00:46:43.860
FACE BIG OVER EACH OTHER.
There are people under 30 in this

1430
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.818
There are people under 30 in this
audience! I think the gentleman had

1431
00:46:47.818 --> 00:46:49.443
audience! I think the gentleman had
an important point, which is that

1432
00:46:49.443 --> 00:46:50.443
an important point, which is that
ambition is important for our

1433
00:46:50.443 --> 00:46:53.818
ambition is important for our
country. If you look at what our

1434
00:46:53.818 --> 00:46:54.901
country. If you look at what our
great grandparents achieved in the

1435
00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:56.235
great grandparents achieved in the
Victorian era in terms of building

1436
00:46:56.235 --> 00:46:58.151
Victorian era in terms of building
the bridge and connecting our

1437
00:46:58.151 --> 00:46:59.401
the bridge and connecting our
country the rail network, in terms

1438
00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:02.610
country the rail network, in terms
of investing hugely in the

1439
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.610
of investing hugely in the
infrastructure which has seen us

1440
00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:04.985
infrastmclure which has seen us
grow and

1441
00:47:04.985 --> 00:47:05.901
infrastructure which has seen us
grow and develop, building up so

1442
00:47:05.901 --> 00:47:07.276
grow and develop, building up so
much of the infrastructure we now

1443
00:47:07.276 --> 00:47:07.985
much of the infrastmclure we now
enjoy, this is

1444
00:47:07.985 --> 00:47:08.651
much of the infrastructure we now
enjoy, this is something that we

1445
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:11.193
enjoy, this is something that we
should be proud of. We should be

1446
00:47:11.193 --> 00:47:12.360
should be proud of. We should be
looking around the country and

1447
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.901
looking around the country and
looking at the whole UK and seeing

1448
00:47:14.901 --> 00:47:16.276
looking at the whole UK and seeing
where the opportunities are, and

1449
00:47:16.276 --> 00:47:17.318
where the opportunities are, and
there are opportunities to invest,

1450
00:47:17.318 --> 00:47:19.818
there are opportunities to invest,
there are some serious

1451
00:47:19.818 --> 00:47:21.193
there are some serious
opportunities, and I hope some of

1452
00:47:21.193 --> 00:47:24.693
opportunities, and I hope some of
the projects we build will stay open

1453
00:47:24.693 --> 00:47:26.235
the projects we build will stay open
in bad weather, unlike the

1454
00:47:26.235 --> 00:47:27.443
in bad weather, unlike the
Queensferry bridge, and I hope that

1455
00:47:27.443 --> 00:47:29.401
Queensferry bridge, and I hope that
some of the areas we make

1456
00:47:29.401 --> 00:47:30.901
some of the areas we make
investments in will be delivered

1457
00:47:30.901 --> 00:47:31.235
investments in will be delivered
on-time

1458
00:47:31.235 --> 00:47:32.235
investments in will be delivered
on—time and on budget, London Bridge

1459
00:47:32.235 --> 00:47:33.818
on-time and on budget, London Bridge
station.

1460
00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:35.610
on—time and on budget, London Bridge
station. We have got a good track

1461
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.860
station. We have got a good track
record here. This is not Berlin

1462
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.235
record here. This is not Bertin
airport which

1463
00:47:38.235 --> 00:47:41.026
record here. This is not Berlin
airport which is now A0 years late.

1464
00:47:41.026 --> 00:47:42.193
airport which is now 40 years late.
Tom is wrong

1465
00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:42.985
airport which is now A0 years late.
Tom is wrong about the bridge,

1466
00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:44.610
Tom is wrong about the bridge,
because the bridge has closed once

1467
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:46.318
because the bridge has closed once
since it was opened two and a half

1468
00:47:46.318 --> 00:47:48.110
since it was opened two and a half
years ago, and it’s remained open on

1469
00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:49.401
years ago, and it’s remained open on
more than 30 patients when the

1470
00:47:49.401 --> 00:47:50.401
more than 30 patients when the
previous route which would have

1471
00:47:50.401 --> 00:47:52.485
previous route which would have
closed because of high winds and,

1472
00:47:52.485 --> 00:47:54.443
closed because of high winds and,
unlike most of Boris’s projects,

1473
00:47:54.443 --> 00:47:55.776
unlike most of Boris’s projects,
that bridge was bought in under

1474
00:47:55.776 --> 00:48:03.901
that bridge was bought in under
budget. But it has closed down. The

1475
00:48:03.901 --> 00:48:05.443
budget. But it has closed down. The
claim was it would never closed as a

1476
00:48:05.443 --> 00:48:09.818
claim was it would never closed as a
result of high winds. I completely

1477
00:48:09.818 --> 00:48:11.610
result of high winds. I completely
understand the frustration of people

1478
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:11.860
understand the fmstration of peopla
when

1479
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.318
understand the frustration of people
when the bridge was closed. I had a

1480
00:48:13.318 --> 00:48:15.526
when the bridge was closed. I had a
ten hour round trip to a funeral in

1481
00:48:15.526 --> 00:48:17.026
ten hour round trip to a funeral in
Aberdeen on Tuesday because the

1482
00:48:17.026 --> 00:48:17.193
Aberdeen on Tuesday because the
bﬂdge

1483
00:48:17.193 --> 00:48:18.401
Aberdeen on Tuesday because the
bridge was closed, but my point is

1484
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:20.610
bridge was closed, but my point is
that this bridge has remained, it’s

1485
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.276
that this bridge has remained, it’s
the first time it’s closed, and it’s

1486
00:48:23.276 --> 00:48:24.443
the first time it’s closed, and it’s
remained open on 30 occasions when

1487
00:48:24.443 --> 00:48:26.276
remained open on 30 occasions when
the previous bridge used to close,

1488
00:48:26.276 --> 00:48:28.276
the previous bridge used to close,
so let’s get this in perspective. A

1489
00:48:28.276 --> 00:48:29.860
so let’s get this in perspective. A
leader of the Conservative Party in

1490
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.318
leader of the Conservative Party in
Scotland, acting leader, ended up

1491
00:48:32.318 --> 00:48:34.485
Scotland, acting leader, ended up
with egg all over his face yesterday

1492
00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:36.901
with egg all over his face yesterday
because he was criticising the

1493
00:48:36.901 --> 00:48:38.443
because he was criticising the
design of the bridge, and it turned

1494
00:48:38.443 --> 00:48:39.693
design of the bridge, and it turned
out he’d convened the committee that

1495
00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:45.110
out he’d convened the committee that
approved the design.

1496
00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:46.360
Lets plot the point—scoring to one

1497
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.568
Lets plot the point-scoring to one
side. One

1498
00:48:48.568 --> 00:48:50.568
Lets plot the point—scoring to one
side. One small point about our

1499
00:48:50.568 --> 00:48:52.568
side. One small point about our
great Victorian heritage, and

1500
00:48:52.568 --> 00:48:54.026
great Victorian heritage, and
engineering achievements were

1501
00:48:54.026 --> 00:48:54.943
engineering achievements were
extraordinary but labour was much

1502
00:48:54.943 --> 00:48:56.443
extraordinary but labour was much
cheaper then and a lot of people

1503
00:48:56.443 --> 00:48:59.360
cheaper then and a lot of peopla
died.

1504
00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.485
cheaper then and a lot of people
died. Let’s take a question from

1505
00:49:01.485 --> 00:49:06.943
died. Let’s take a question from
Mark Fowlie. With drug deaths in

1506
00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:07.193
Mark Fowlie. with dmg deaths in
Dundee

1507
00:49:07.193 --> 00:49:08.485
Mark Fowlie. With drug deaths in
Dundee expected to rise, are we

1508
00:49:08.485 --> 00:49:11.318
Dundee expected to rise, are we
doing enough to prevent this? We

1509
00:49:11.318 --> 00:49:16.318
doing enough to prevent this? We
have been talking about putting it

1510
00:49:16.318 --> 00:49:17.943
have been talking about putting it
in perspective. Dundee has the

1511
00:49:17.943 --> 00:49:19.485
in perspective. Dundee has the
highest level of drug—related deaths

1512
00:49:19.485 --> 00:49:19.735
highest level of duly-related deaths
in

1513
00:49:19.735 --> 00:49:21.151
highest level of drug—related deaths
in Scotland and Scotland has the

1514
00:49:21.151 --> 00:49:22.235
in Scotland and Scotland has the
highest level of drug—related deaths

1515
00:49:22.235 --> 00:49:25.193
highest level of duly-related deaths
in Europe.

1516
00:49:25.193 --> 00:49:26.693
highest level of drug—related deaths
in Europe. The SNP has been in

1517
00:49:26.693 --> 00:49:29.110
in Europe. The SNP has been in
government for about 13 years. It’s

1518
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:33.443
government for about 13 years. It’s
not looking good on your record. You

1519
00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:35.026
not looking good on your record. You
cannot blame the SNP government

1520
00:49:35.026 --> 00:49:37.485
cannot blame the SNP government
wholly for this because drugs policy

1521
00:49:37.485 --> 00:49:42.735
wholly for this because drugs policy
is controlled from Westminster. Do

1522
00:49:42.735 --> 00:49:44.151
is controlled from Westminster. Do
you take any responsibility? Of

1523
00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:45.776
you take any responsibility? Of
course my colleagues in the Scottish

1524
00:49:45.776 --> 00:49:47.068
course my colleagues in the Scottish
Government will take responsible tea

1525
00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:49.151
Government will take responsible tea
for this and more importantly they

1526
00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:51.526
for this and more importantly they
are taking action. As you will be

1527
00:49:51.526 --> 00:49:53.318
are taking action. As you will be
aware, there will be a drugs summit

1528
00:49:53.318 --> 00:49:55.985
aware, there will be a drugs summit
in Glasgow, there will be two drugs

1529
00:49:55.985 --> 00:49:57.360
in Glasgow, there will be two drugs
summit, the British covenant have

1530
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.985
summit, the British covenant have
organised one but the Scottish

1531
00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:00.110
organised one but the Scottish
Government have organised one which

1532
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:02.068
Government have organised one which
will take evidence from people who

1533
00:50:02.068 --> 00:50:04.443
will take evidence from people who
have lived experience of the drugs

1534
00:50:04.443 --> 00:50:05.943
have lived experience of the drugs
crisis. That is the crucial

1535
00:50:05.943 --> 00:50:07.485
crisis. That is the crucial
difference between the Scottish

1536
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:09.485
difference between the Scottish
Government summit and the British

1537
00:50:09.485 --> 00:50:11.068
Government summit and the British
government summit. Like the Dundee

1538
00:50:11.068 --> 00:50:12.610
government summit. Like the Dundee
project that looked at the causes of

1539
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.693
project that looked at the causes of
dmg deaths in

1540
00:50:14.693 --> 00:50:15.401
project that looked at the causes of
drug deaths in this city, the

1541
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:17.235
drug deaths in this city, the
Scottish Government summit will hear

1542
00:50:17.235 --> 00:50:19.360
Scottish Government summit will hear
evidence from people at the heart of

1543
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.276
evidence from people at the heart of
the crisis. I think what’s clear is

1544
00:50:23.276 --> 00:50:24.485
the crisis. I think what’s clear is
that the approach to date hasn’t

1545
00:50:24.485 --> 00:50:29.276
that the approach to date hasn’t
worked. Do you think part of the

1546
00:50:29.276 --> 00:50:33.151
worked. Do you think part of the
problem is the cuts that the

1547
00:50:33.151 --> 00:50:36.193
problem is the cuts that the
government has made to this region’s

1548
00:50:36.193 --> 00:50:40.776
government has made to this region’s
alcohol and drug... It’s a much more

1549
00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:42.151
alcohol and drug... It’s a much more
complex problem than that. There are

1550
00:50:42.151 --> 00:50:44.693
complex problem than that. There are
lots of things feeding into the

1551
00:50:44.693 --> 00:50:46.110
lots of things feeding into the
crisis including poverty, mental

1552
00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.401
crisis including poverty, mental
health issues, not

1553
00:50:47.401 --> 00:50:47.860
crisis including poverty, mental
health issues, notjust life

1554
00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:48.026
health issues, not just life
poverty.

1555
00:50:48.026 --> 00:50:50.818
health issues, notjust life
poverty, but poverty of ambition.

1556
00:50:50.818 --> 00:50:52.776
poverty, but poverty of ambition.
The Scottish affairs committee at

1557
00:50:52.776 --> 00:50:54.318
The Scottish affairs committee at
Westminster chaired by my colleague

1558
00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:56.151
Westminster chaired by my colleague
Pete Wishart held up a wide—ranging

1559
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:56.568
Pete wishart held up a wide-ranging
enquiry into

1560
00:50:56.568 --> 00:50:57.818
Pete Wishart held up a wide—ranging
enquiry into the causes of drug

1561
00:50:57.818 --> 00:50:58.026
enquiry into the causes of dmg
deaths

1562
00:50:58.026 --> 00:50:59.526
enquiry into the causes of drug
deaths in Scotland in the last

1563
00:50:59.526 --> 00:51:00.860
deaths in Scotland in the last
Parliament, and heard evidence from

1564
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:01.276
Partiament, and heard evidence from
all sorts

1565
00:51:01.276 --> 00:51:02.776
Parliament, and heard evidence from
all sorts of people and came to the

1566
00:51:02.776 --> 00:51:05.360
all sorts of people and came to the
conclusion that what we needed was a

1567
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:05.568
conclusion that what we needed was a
pub“:

1568
00:51:05.568 --> 00:51:06.901
conclusion that what we needed was a
public health approach to this and

1569
00:51:06.901 --> 00:51:08.276
public health approach to this and
we need to de—criminalise those who

1570
00:51:08.276 --> 00:51:10.776
we need to de-criminalise those who
are just using

1571
00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:12.360
we need to de—criminalise those who
are just using small amounts. Some

1572
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.818
are just using small amounts. Some
of my colleagues at Westminster,

1573
00:51:14.818 --> 00:51:16.985
of my colleagues at Westminster,
such as Alison Thewliss, Tommy

1574
00:51:16.985 --> 00:51:17.943
such as Alison Thewliss, Tommy
Sheppard and Ronnie Karen have

1575
00:51:17.943 --> 00:51:22.276
Sheppard and Ronnie Karen have
pushed the idea of having safe drug

1576
00:51:22.276 --> 00:51:22.526
pushed the idea of having safe dmg
consumption

1577
00:51:22.526 --> 00:51:24.360
pushed the idea of having safe drug
consumption rooms, places where

1578
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:24.901
consumption rooms, places where
peopla ran

1579
00:51:24.901 --> 00:51:26.610
consumption rooms, places where
people can safely consume drugs in a

1580
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:26.901
peopla ran safely consume drugs in a
safe

1581
00:51:26.901 --> 00:51:28.485
people can safely consume drugs in a
safe environment. We have been

1582
00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:29.276
safe environment. We have been
pushing the Westminster government

1583
00:51:29.276 --> 00:51:30.943
pushing the Westminster government
to agree to this and so far they

1584
00:51:30.943 --> 00:51:33.985
to agree to this and so far they
have not agreed. I am interested in

1585
00:51:33.985 --> 00:51:36.151
have not agreed. I am interested in
a blame game here. I am interested

1586
00:51:36.151 --> 00:51:38.526
a blame game here. I am interested
in getting to the root of the crisis

1587
00:51:38.526 --> 00:51:40.485
in getting to the root of the crisis
and finding out what the solutions

1588
00:51:40.485 --> 00:51:42.360
and finding out what the solutions
are. I think in Dundee steps have

1589
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.110
are. I think in Dundee steps have
been done to do that already with

1590
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.401
been done to do that already with
the project you have because you

1591
00:51:45.401 --> 00:51:48.151
the project you have because you
have listened to the people who are

1592
00:51:48.151 --> 00:51:49.860
have listened to the people who are
suffering at the heart of the

1593
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.401
suffering at the heart of the
crisis. That is what the Scottish

1594
00:51:51.401 --> 00:51:53.693
crisis. That is what the Scottish
Government summit will do in

1595
00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:55.193
Government summit will do in
February and that evidence, the

1596
00:51:55.193 --> 00:51:56.860
February and that evidence, the
lived experience of the crisis will

1597
00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.443
lived experience of the crisis will
be fed into the British government’s

1598
00:51:58.443 --> 00:52:04.151
be fed into the British government’s
next summit as well.

1599
00:52:04.776 --> 00:52:06.985
next summit as well. This is one of
those questions where cooperation

1600
00:52:06.985 --> 00:52:10.443
those questions where cooperation
matters so much. Because how we work

1601
00:52:10.443 --> 00:52:12.943
matters so much. Because how we work
together across all our communities

1602
00:52:12.943 --> 00:52:16.526
together across all our communities
as a direct impact. Drugs don’t

1603
00:52:16.526 --> 00:52:17.568
as a direct impact. Dmgs don’t
recognise

1604
00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:18.901
as a direct impact. Drugs don’t
recognise borders in that sense.

1605
00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:21.485
recognise borders in that sense.
They don’t recognise county or

1606
00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:22.651
They don’t recognise county or
council or national borders within

1607
00:52:22.651 --> 00:52:25.485
council or national borders within
our country at all. And we know how

1608
00:52:25.485 --> 00:52:26.235
our country at all. And we know how
many dmgs are

1609
00:52:26.235 --> 00:52:26.985
our country at all. And we know how
many drugs are coming in from

1610
00:52:26.985 --> 00:52:28.735
many drugs are coming in from
overseas and how they come through

1611
00:52:28.735 --> 00:52:30.026
overseas and how they come through
our country in various different

1612
00:52:30.026 --> 00:52:32.860
our country in various different
ways. And what about consumption

1613
00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.193
ways. And what about consumption
mmours

1614
00:52:33.193 --> 00:52:35.860
ways. And what about consumption
rumours that the SNP have pushed for

1615
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:37.360
rumours that the SNP have pushed for
and the Westminster government...

1616
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.901
and the Westminster government...
For various reasons we have actually

1617
00:52:39.901 --> 00:52:41.901
For various reasons we have actually
tried consumption rooms, not here in

1618
00:52:41.901 --> 00:52:44.443
tried consumption rooms, not here in
the UK but around Europe, including

1619
00:52:44.443 --> 00:52:47.193
the UK but around Europe, including
the Netherlands, where it has

1620
00:52:47.193 --> 00:52:48.610
the Netherlands, where it has
attracted serious social issues,

1621
00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:49.901
attracted serious social issues,
from other neighbouring countries

1622
00:52:49.901 --> 00:52:51.068
from other neighbouring countries
into the Netherlands the stop they

1623
00:52:51.068 --> 00:52:51.818
into the Nethertands the stop they
tried it

1624
00:52:51.818 --> 00:52:53.360
into the Netherlands the stop they
tried it in Switzerland with similar

1625
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.026
tried it in Switzeriand with similar
problams. It

1626
00:52:54.026 --> 00:52:54.901
tried it in Switzerland with similar
problems. It isn’t an answer unless

1627
00:52:54.901 --> 00:52:57.068
problams. It isn’t an answer unless
it is part of a

1628
00:52:57.068 --> 00:52:57.693
problems. It isn’t an answer unless
it is part of a much wider strategy.

1629
00:52:57.693 --> 00:53:00.235
it is part of a much wider strategy.
That’s why I welcome the fact the

1630
00:53:00.235 --> 00:53:02.026
That’s why I welcome the fact the
government has organised the Glasgow

1631
00:53:02.026 --> 00:53:04.485
government has organised the Glasgow
conference in February. I think it’s

1632
00:53:04.485 --> 00:53:06.776
conference in February. I think it’s
really important. I am a little bit

1633
00:53:06.776 --> 00:53:08.568
really important. I am a little bit
surprised that it was only when that

1634
00:53:08.568 --> 00:53:10.526
surprised that it was only when that
was organised at the Scottish

1635
00:53:10.526 --> 00:53:11.943
was organised at the Scottish
Government organised their summit

1636
00:53:11.943 --> 00:53:13.818
Government organised their summit
for the day before. The Scottish

1637
00:53:13.818 --> 00:53:14.443
for the day before. The Scottish
Government has a

1638
00:53:14.443 --> 00:53:15.276
for the day before. The Scottish
Government has 3 drugs task force

1639
00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:15.943
Government has a drugs task force
set up some

1640
00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:16.776
Government has 3 drugs task force
set up some time ago with someone

1641
00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:20.151
set up some time ago with someone
reading it so this is not the first

1642
00:53:20.151 --> 00:53:21.235
reading it so this is not the first
reaction. The Scottish Government

1643
00:53:21.235 --> 00:53:23.943
reaction. The Scottish Government
has set up their summit in Glasgow

1644
00:53:23.943 --> 00:53:24.776
has set up their summit in Glasgow
because the British government

1645
00:53:24.776 --> 00:53:28.235
because the British government
summit would not set up with hearing

1646
00:53:28.235 --> 00:53:29.568
summit would not set up with hearing
evidence from people at the heart of

1647
00:53:29.568 --> 00:53:34.193
evidence from people at the heart of
the crisis. Forgive me, as you know

1648
00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:35.360
the crisis. Forgive me, as you know
very well, joanna,

1649
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.360
the crisis. Forgive me, as you know
very well, Joanna, the SNP has been

1650
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.026
very well, joanna, the SNP has been
in government

1651
00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:38.568
very well, Joanna, the SNP has been
in government here now for over a

1652
00:53:38.568 --> 00:53:41.151
in government here now for over a
decade. As you have been in London.

1653
00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.401
decade. As you have been in London.
Dmgs deaths in

1654
00:53:42.401 --> 00:53:42.901
decade. As you have been in London.
Drugs deaths in Scotland are three

1655
00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:43.151
Dmgs deaths in Scotland are three
times

1656
00:53:43.151 --> 00:53:45.776
Drugs deaths in Scotland are three
times that of the rest of the UK.

1657
00:53:45.776 --> 00:53:47.151
times that of the rest of the UK.
This is a very serious social

1658
00:53:47.151 --> 00:53:50.401
This is a very serious social
crisis. We need a joint approach.

1659
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:54.151
crisis. We need a joint approach.
This is something we have to work on

1660
00:53:54.151 --> 00:53:55.526
This is something we have to work on
together and not have separate

1661
00:53:55.526 --> 00:53:57.401
together and not have separate
conferences simply in order to fly a

1662
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:57.818
conferences simply in order to ﬂy a
ﬂag when

1663
00:53:57.818 --> 00:53:58.610
conferences simply in order to fly a
flag when cooperation is much more

1664
00:53:58.610 --> 00:53:59.818
ﬂag when cooperation is much more
important. The

1665
00:53:59.818 --> 00:54:00.651
flag when cooperation is much more
important. The woman with the blonde

1666
00:54:00.651 --> 00:54:02.985
important. The woman with the blonde
hair. I

1667
00:54:02.985 --> 00:54:03.193
important. The woman with the blonde
hair. Isat

1668
00:54:03.193 --> 00:54:04.360
important. The woman with the blonde
hair. I sat on one of the working

1669
00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:04.568
hair. I sat on one of the working
EWUPS

1670
00:54:04.568 --> 00:54:08.860
hair. I sat on one of the working
groups for the care review, the

1671
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.151
groups for the rare review, the
Scottish

1672
00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:09.943
groups for the care review, the
Scottish independent care review and

1673
00:54:09.943 --> 00:54:10.360
Scottish independent rare review and
it would

1674
00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.943
Scottish independent care review and
it would be great for people to

1675
00:54:12.943 --> 00:54:15.526
it would be great for people to
acknowledge that we now know the

1676
00:54:15.526 --> 00:54:16.776
acknowledge that we now know the
trauma and poverty and adversities

1677
00:54:16.776 --> 00:54:17.401
trauma and poverty and adversities
peopla face

1678
00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:18.110
trauma and poverty and adversities
people face that are pushing people

1679
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:18.735
peopla face that are pushing peopla
to drugs and

1680
00:54:18.735 --> 00:54:20.860
people face that are pushing people
to drugs and they feel they have no

1681
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.693
to drugs and they feel they have no
choice. Young people in Dundee are

1682
00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.318
choice. Young people in Dundee are
in crisis with their mental health

1683
00:54:24.318 --> 00:54:26.151
in crisis with their mental health
because of the trauma of the poverty

1684
00:54:26.151 --> 00:54:28.610
because of the trauma of the poverty
they live in. It needs to be an

1685
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:31.901
they live in. It needs to be an
approach on everything, definitely.

1686
00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:35.735
approach on everything, definitely.
The gentleman over here. The problem

1687
00:54:35.735 --> 00:54:37.735
The gentleman over here. The problem
is that it’s not today or yesterday

1688
00:54:37.735 --> 00:54:38.860
is that it’s not today or yesterday
that this problem has affected

1689
00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:42.943
that this problem has affected
Dundee. It’s all very well to talk

1690
00:54:42.943 --> 00:54:45.068
Dundee. It’s all very well to talk
about summits and new measures, but

1691
00:54:45.068 --> 00:54:47.568
about summits and new measures, but
they don’t sound like measures,

1692
00:54:47.568 --> 00:54:48.776
they don’t sound like measures,
controlled consumption, it doesn’t

1693
00:54:48.776 --> 00:54:50.818
controlled consumption, it doesn’t
sound like a measure that is likely

1694
00:54:50.818 --> 00:54:51.651
sound like a measure that is likely
to tackla

1695
00:54:51.651 --> 00:54:52.610
sound like a measure that is likely
to tackle such an overwhelming

1696
00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:52.985
to tackla such an overwhelming
crisis

1697
00:54:52.985 --> 00:54:55.443
to tackle such an overwhelming
crisis that has been going on for so

1698
00:54:55.443 --> 00:55:02.901
crisis that has been going on for so
long. It needs a multifactorial,

1699
00:55:04.193 --> 00:55:04.985
long. It needs a multifactorial,
multi—country, multi—agency

1700
00:55:04.985 --> 00:55:05.818
multi—country, multi—agency
multipronged approach. Perhaps look

1701
00:55:05.818 --> 00:55:07.943
multipronged approach. Perhaps look
at other towns across the world that

1702
00:55:07.943 --> 00:55:10.193
at other towns across the world that
have had this problem and found a

1703
00:55:10.193 --> 00:55:10.443
have had this problem and found a
“Y

1704
00:55:10.443 --> 00:55:13.735
have had this problem and found a
way to solve it. I think a little

1705
00:55:13.735 --> 00:55:15.151
way to solve it. I think a little
piecemeal and incremental ways to

1706
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:16.735
piecemeal and incremental ways to
think about tackling it are just not

1707
00:55:16.735 --> 00:55:22.110
think about tackling it are just not
going to work.

1708
00:55:22.818 --> 00:55:26.360
going to work. Alex? I am glad
listening to the elected

1709
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.443
listening to the elected
representatives hear that they are

1710
00:55:27.443 --> 00:55:30.193
representatives hear that they are
not playing a blame game or

1711
00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:31.568
not playing a blame game or
indulging in something as

1712
00:55:31.568 --> 00:55:33.360
indulging in something as
constructive as arguments as to who

1713
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.735
constructive as arguments as to who
is than the other person’s summit.

1714
00:55:36.735 --> 00:55:38.401
is than the other person’s summit.
The gentleman here is absolutely

1715
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.901
The gentleman here is absolutely
right that it is a wide—ranging

1716
00:55:40.901 --> 00:55:41.110
right that it is a wide-ranging
problem.

1717
00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:42.443
right that it is a wide—ranging
problem. We still don’t actually, I

1718
00:55:42.443 --> 00:55:44.193
problem. We still don’t actually, I
think, despite a lot of good work

1719
00:55:44.193 --> 00:55:46.110
think, despite a lot of good work
that has been done, including by the

1720
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.443
that has been done, including by the
Scottish affairs committee at

1721
00:55:48.443 --> 00:55:49.401
Scottish affairs committee at
Westminster, that we don’t

1722
00:55:49.401 --> 00:55:51.068
Westminster, that we don’t
understand why the problem is so

1723
00:55:51.068 --> 00:55:52.985
understand why the problem is so
much worse in Glasgow and Dundee

1724
00:55:52.985 --> 00:55:56.776
much worse in Glasgow and Dundee
than it is for instance in Liverpool

1725
00:55:56.776 --> 00:55:59.193
than it is for instance in Liverpool
or Newcastle, cities with similar

1726
00:55:59.193 --> 00:56:00.151
or Newcastle, cities with similar
histories and demographics in some

1727
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:02.360
histories and demographic in some
respects. But

1728
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.651
histories and demographics in some
respects. But it is. And while it is

1729
00:56:03.651 --> 00:56:04.026
respects. But it is. And whila it is
tme that

1730
00:56:04.026 --> 00:56:05.110
respects. But it is. And while it is
true that cuts to services are not

1731
00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:05.568
tme that cuts to services are not
the only

1732
00:56:05.568 --> 00:56:07.693
true that cuts to services are not
the only reason that things have got

1733
00:56:07.693 --> 00:56:08.985
the only reason that things have got
worse, it is also reasonable to

1734
00:56:08.985 --> 00:56:09.151
worse, it is also reasonabla to
suppose

1735
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:10.443
worse, it is also reasonable to
suppose the cuts to those services

1736
00:56:10.443 --> 00:56:14.318
suppose the cuts to those services
have not helped. The most recent

1737
00:56:14.318 --> 00:56:15.610
have not helped. The most recent
Scottish Government budget has given

1738
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.901
Scottish Government budget has given
some of that money back to some of

1739
00:56:17.901 --> 00:56:20.068
some of that money back to some of
these services, making up for

1740
00:56:20.068 --> 00:56:21.693
these services, making up for
previous productions, and that is

1741
00:56:21.693 --> 00:56:23.651
previous productions, and that is
obviously welcome. It is possible

1742
00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:23.860
obviously welcome. It is possibla
that

1743
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.610
obviously welcome. It is possible
that the idea of safe consumption

1744
00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:29.235
that the idea of safe consumption
rooms might alleviate matters in

1745
00:56:29.235 --> 00:56:30.568
rooms might alleviate matters in
Dundee, Glasgow and elsewhere, but I

1746
00:56:30.568 --> 00:56:32.776
Dundee, Glasgow and elsewhere, but I
don’t think even proponents of that

1747
00:56:32.776 --> 00:56:34.526
don’t think even proponents of that
approach really believe that it is a

1748
00:56:34.526 --> 00:56:39.735
approach really believe that it is a
long term solution. But at the

1749
00:56:39.735 --> 00:56:41.276
long term solution. But at the
moment, the notion of trying to do

1750
00:56:41.276 --> 00:56:41.901
moment, the notion of trying to do
what ran

1751
00:56:41.901 --> 00:56:44.193
moment, the notion of trying to do
what can be done to stop matters

1752
00:56:44.193 --> 00:56:44.568
what ran be done to stop matters
getting any

1753
00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:45.360
what can be done to stop matters
getting any worse is probably the

1754
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.693
getting any worse is probably the
first step. Stabilising the

1755
00:56:49.693 --> 00:56:50.985
first step. Stabilising the
situation, which is a fairly

1756
00:56:50.985 --> 00:56:52.526
situation, which is a fairly
depressing way of looking at it, but

1757
00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:55.401
depressing way of looking at it, but
the notion there is a quick solution

1758
00:56:55.401 --> 00:56:58.526
the notion there is a quick solution
to this, I think is misguided,

1759
00:56:58.526 --> 00:57:00.068
to this, I think is misguided,
unfortunately. If only that were the

1760
00:57:00.068 --> 00:57:00.901
unfortunately. If only that were the
use. A

1761
00:57:00.901 --> 00:57:02.735
unfortunately. If only that were the
case. A lot of things come into it

1762
00:57:02.735 --> 00:57:06.026
use. A lot of things come into it
in terms of

1763
00:57:06.026 --> 00:57:06.610
case. A lot of things come into it
in terms of poverty, mental health,

1764
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.151
in terms of poverty, mental health,
educational achievement, aspiration,

1765
00:57:08.151 --> 00:57:09.818
educational achievement, aspiration,
family breakdown, all these things

1766
00:57:09.818 --> 00:57:11.151
family breakdown, all these things
are involved but it makes it

1767
00:57:11.151 --> 00:57:12.110
are involved but it makes it
difficult to isolate the single

1768
00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:12.318
difficult to isolate the singla
thing

1769
00:57:12.318 --> 00:57:14.235
difficult to isolate the single
thing that will make a real

1770
00:57:14.235 --> 00:57:15.901
thing that will make a real
difference, except in terms perhaps

1771
00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:17.901
difference, except in terms perhaps
of intervention on a patient by

1772
00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:21.068
of intervention on a patient by
patient basis. What’s going wrong in

1773
00:57:21.068 --> 00:57:22.693
patient basis. What’s going wrong in
Scotland? We have the highest death

1774
00:57:22.693 --> 00:57:24.568
Scotland? We have the highest death
rate in Europe in Dundee and the

1775
00:57:24.568 --> 00:57:26.068
rate in Europe in Dundee and the
highest death rate in Europe in

1776
00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:32.068
highest death rate in Europe in
Scotland. Those aspects like

1777
00:57:32.068 --> 00:57:32.276
Scotland. Those aspects like
poverty.

1778
00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:34.901
Scotland. Those aspects like
poverty, trauma, lack of ambition

1779
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:35.901
poverty, trauma, lack of ambition
and prosperity. People will take

1780
00:57:35.901 --> 00:57:37.818
and prosperity. People will take
drugs and we have to make it as safe

1781
00:57:37.818 --> 00:57:38.568
drugs and we have to make it as safe
as possibla so

1782
00:57:38.568 --> 00:57:39.151
drugs and we have to make it as safe
as possible so we can ultimately

1783
00:57:39.151 --> 00:57:39.360
as possibla so we ran ultimately
help

1784
00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:39.901
as possible so we ran ultimately
help them to

1785
00:57:39.901 --> 00:57:43.693
as possible so we can ultimately
help them to find a way out of this.

1786
00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:46.610
help them to find a way out of this.

no control over what is in these

1792
00:57:52.943 --> 00:57:54.443
no control over what is in these

They take overdoses without even

1795
00:57:58.526 --> 00:58:00.735
They take overdoses without even
knowing they are taking overdoses. I

1796
00:58:00.735 --> 00:58:03.151
knowing they are taking overdoses. I
think the way to go is the

1797
00:58:03.151 --> 00:58:04.485
think the way to go is the
decriminalisation of drugs. We

1798
00:58:04.485 --> 00:58:06.151
decriminalisation of drugs. We
control them, the government

1799
00:58:06.151 --> 00:58:07.943
control them, the government
controls them, licenses them, get

1800
00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:09.401
controls them, licenses them, get
them from the chemist, the quality

1801
00:58:09.401 --> 00:58:12.110
them from the chemist, the quality
is controlled and people know what

1802
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:12.443
is controlled and peopla know what
they are

1803
00:58:12.443 --> 00:58:13.235
is controlled and people know what
they are taking. Gradually over time

1804
00:58:13.235 --> 00:58:15.401
they are taking. Gradually over time
you work with people to break the

1805
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:15.735
you work with peopla to break the
habit.

1806
00:58:15.735 --> 00:58:16.985
you work with people to break the
habit. But while they are still in

1807
00:58:16.985 --> 00:58:17.443
habit. But whila they are still in
the habit,

1808
00:58:17.443 --> 00:58:18.901
habit. But while they are still in
the habit, you make it safe for them

1809
00:58:18.901 --> 00:58:21.068
the habit, you make it safe for them
to do it and raise money through

1810
00:58:21.068 --> 00:58:24.360
to do it and raise money through
taxes. APPLAUSE

Would you support that, Ian? I don’t

Would you support that, Ian? I don’t
think we should come to any knee

1813
00:58:31.776 --> 00:58:33.901
think we should come to any knee
jerk quick fixes. Over 3000 people

1814
00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:37.110
jerk quick fixes. Over 3000 people
died last year and that’s 3000 too

1815
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.318
died last year and that’s 3000 too
many. I had a constituent who lost

1816
00:58:39.318 --> 00:58:40.943
many. I had a constituent who lost
her son to drugs. It’s a

1817
00:58:40.943 --> 00:58:41.776
her son to drugs. It’s a
heartbreaking story and something

1818
00:58:41.776 --> 00:58:44.151
heartbreaking story and something
that should never have happened. We

1819
00:58:44.151 --> 00:58:46.610
that should never have happened. We
have to find a way through this

1820
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:48.901
have to find a way through this
crisis. It is multifaceted, as has

1821
00:58:48.901 --> 00:58:50.901
crisis. It is multifaceted, as has
been said, there is no doubt about

1822
00:58:50.901 --> 00:58:52.651
been said, there is no doubt about
that, and it leads back to poverty

1823
00:58:52.651 --> 00:58:57.318
that, and it leads back to poverty
but also services. This blame game

1824
00:58:57.318 --> 00:58:58.401
but also services. This blame game
at Westminster is controlling drug

1825
00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.193
at Westminster is controlling dmg
policy so we

1826
00:58:59.193 --> 00:59:00.693
at Westminster is controlling drug
policy so we can’t do anything about

1827
00:59:00.693 --> 00:59:01.901
policy so we can’t do anything about
it in Scotland doesn’t answer the

1828
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:03.860
it in Scotland doesn’t answer the
question of why the Scottish drugs

1829
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.901
question of why the Scottish drugs
death rate is much higher and wide

1830
00:59:05.901 --> 00:59:07.610
death rate is much higher and wide
Dundee’s rate is much

1831
00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:08.026
death rate is much higher and wide
Dundee’s rate is much higher. Maybe

1832
00:59:08.026 --> 00:59:10.110
Dundee’s rate is much higher. Maybe
we could do it tonight,

1833
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:10.610
Dundee’s rate is much higher. Maybe
we could do it tonight, maybe both

1834
00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:11.818
we could do it tonight, maybe both
these conferences could commit to

1835
00:59:11.818 --> 00:59:13.943
these conferences could commit to
come together and lets get the

1836
00:59:13.943 --> 00:59:15.110
come together and lets get the
evidence on why Scotland’s death

1837
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.485
evidence on why Scotland’s death
rate is much higher than the rest of

1838
00:59:17.485 --> 00:59:19.901
rate is much higher than the rest of
the UK when the rest of the UK has

1839
00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:21.568
the UK when the rest of the UK has
the exact same drugs policy. I would

1840
00:59:21.568 --> 00:59:23.776
the exact same drugs policy. I would
suggest part of the problem is a

1841
00:59:23.776 --> 00:59:25.693
suggest part of the problem is a
slashing of local government budgets

1842
00:59:25.693 --> 00:59:25.901
slashing of [oral government budgets
where

1843
00:59:25.901 --> 00:59:27.401
slashing of local government budgets
where the services are, a slashing

1844
00:59:27.401 --> 00:59:29.235
where the services are, a slashing
of alcohol and drugs support. The

1845
00:59:29.235 --> 00:59:31.651
of alcohol and drugs support. The
NHS in Scotland is in crisis, and

1846
00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:33.193
NHS in Scotland is in crisis, and
there is an education system that is

1847
00:59:33.193 --> 00:59:34.901
there is an education system that is
trying to teach kids where there is

1848
00:59:34.901 --> 00:59:36.651
trying to teach kids where there is
more loaded on in terms of how kids

1849
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:39.193
more loaded on in terms of how kids
are living and you can spot those

1850
00:59:39.193 --> 00:59:39.901
are living and you ran spot those
signs earty on.

1851
00:59:39.901 --> 00:59:41.193
are living and you can spot those
signs early on. It’s a failure in

1852
00:59:41.193 --> 00:59:41.443
signs earty on. It’s a failure in
pub“:

1853
00:59:41.443 --> 00:59:42.235
signs early on. It’s a failure in
public policy and both governments

1854
00:59:42.235 --> 00:59:43.693
public policy and both governments
need to take responsivity for that

1855
00:59:43.693 --> 00:59:45.901
need to take responsivity for that
so we don’t have more people losing

1856
00:59:45.901 --> 00:59:46.610
so we don’t have more peopla losing
their son

1857
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.568
so we don’t have more people losing
their son is like my constituent.

1858
00:59:48.568 --> 00:59:54.360
their son is like my constituent.
Let me point out that 1000 died last

1859
00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.735
Let me point out that 1000 died last
year. Not 3000, but it is still a

1860
00:59:56.735 --> 00:59:57.401
year. Mot 3000, but it is still a
lot. Maybe

1861
00:59:57.401 --> 00:59:58.276
year. Not 3000, but it is still a
lot. Maybe we will have that

1862
00:59:58.276 --> 00:59:59.901
lot. Maybe we will have that
conversation about getting the two

1863
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:02.401
conversation about getting the two
conferences together. A lot of you

1864
01:00:02.401 --> 01:00:04.151
conferences together. A lot of you
have your hands up. Apologies I

1865

1882
01:00:30.735 --> 01:00:33.276

01:00:40.026 --> 01:00:43.860
for watching and listening. From
Dundee, goodbye.

1887
01:01:08.735 --> 01:01:09.693
This is not our culture.

1888
01:01:09.693 --> 01:01:12.193
Some would argue
this is not any of our business.

1889
01:01:12.193 --> 01:01:13.901
People don’t like it when they see
blood.

1890
01:01:13.901 --> 01:01:15.318
It’s easy to go to the supermarket

1891
01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:17.193
and buy beef without seeing
the slaughter.

1892
01:01:17.193 --> 01:01:19.318
These pilot whales
should just be left alone.

1893
01:01:19.318 --> 01:01:22.193
They don’t need to be slaughtered
forfood orfor tradition.

1894
01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.776
Check this. I’m tacking more
than just big issues tonight.

1895
01:02:03.776 --> 01:02:06.026
VAR!

1896
01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.485
Oh, gosh...

1897
01:02:07.485 --> 01:02:09.193
Order your fundraising pack now

1898
01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:11.318
so you can get loads
of wicked ideas

1899
01:02:11.318 --> 01:02:14.360
and get your kit on to raise money
for Sport Relief.

1900
01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.110
Laura, you messaged us
earliersaying, remind me,

1901
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.485
shout out to Freddie
in Downing Street and

1902
01:02:40.485 --> 01:02:43.235
the penis reshuffle story
and Margaret Beckett by mistake.

1903
01:02:43.235 --> 01:02:46.818
I don’t understand
what any of that means.

1904
01:02:46.818 --> 01:02:50.776
There are quite a few things
in that sentence to unpack.

1905
01:02:50.776 --> 01:02:53.401
I didn’t know you are going
to read out the message.

1906
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:55.068
I wasjust going to remind you!

1907
01:02:55.068 --> 01:02:56.776
0K, well, remind us
of the substance.

1908
01:02:56.776 --> 01:02:57.818
The substance.

1909
01:02:57.818 --> 01:02:59.943
We need to say hello
to Freddie and Ryan,

1910
01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.360
who work at Number Ten,
who were in Downing Street

1911
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.276
this morning, who said,
when’s your next Newscast

1912
01:03:04.276 --> 01:03:06.193
and will you give us a shout out?

1913
01:03:06.193 --> 01:03:07.235
Sojob done.

1914
01:03:07.235 --> 01:03:08.276
Here you are.

1915
01:03:08.276 --> 01:03:13.026
There are people in Downing Street
listening to this important podcast.

1916
01:03:13.026 --> 01:03:15.693
Number two, once a reshuffle had
a very, very near accident

1917
01:03:15.693 --> 01:03:17.860
because there was a plan
in government to found

1918
01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.860
a new department until somebody
noticed the acronym was P—E—N—I—S.

1919
01:03:23.318 --> 01:03:28.151
And that government department
never came into being.

1920
01:03:28.151 --> 01:03:29.735
What would have been its business?

1921
01:03:29.735 --> 01:03:32.110
It would have been
a cock—up if it had.

1922
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:33.568
Very good!

1923
01:03:33.568 --> 01:03:35.193
Anyway, welcome to Newscast.

1924
01:03:35.193 --> 01:03:36.568
Newscast!

1925
01:03:36.568 --> 01:03:39.068
Newscast. Newscast.
Newscast from the BBC.

1926
01:03:39.068 --> 01:03:43.651
Going to Pizza Express in Woking
is an unusual thing for me to do.

1927
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:45.276
You are a white, privileged male.

1928
01:03:45.276 --> 01:03:47.735
Nobody has a BLEEP
clue what Brexit is.

1929
01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:49.651
This is not an elitist issue.

1930
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.443
This is a quality of life issue.

1931
01:03:52.443 --> 01:03:56.068
I urge everybody to find closure
and let the healing begin.

1932
01:03:56.068 --> 01:04:00.693
You have stolen my dreams and my
childhood with your empty words.

1933
01:04:00.693 --> 01:04:04.151
You are failing us.

1934
01:04:08.443 --> 01:04:09.693
It’s Chris Mason at Westminster.

1935
01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:13.818
Hang on, what about Margaret
Beckett and penises?

1936
01:04:13.818 --> 01:04:16.693
Well, the Margaret Beckett thing has
nothing to do with the department

1937
01:04:16.693 --> 01:04:19.151
called PENIS that never
came into being.

1938
01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:21.901
Somebody told me this week,
when I was researching the history

1939
01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:25.151
of reshuffles going bad,
that actually Margaret Beckett

1940
01:04:25.151 --> 01:04:28.568
becoming Foreign Secretary
was the product of a reshuffle under

1941
01:04:28.568 --> 01:04:31.943
New Labour when the dominoes kind
of fell in the wrong place,

1942
01:04:31.943 --> 01:04:34.776
and it was a bit of an accident.

1943
01:04:34.776 --> 01:04:37.901
I haven’t put that to her,
and if she’s hearing this she might

1944
01:04:37.901 --> 01:04:40.026
feel very differently,
but that is part of reshuffle

1945
01:04:40.026 --> 01:04:44.360
mythology, including somebody
who didn’t get a job

1946
01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.568
because the post—it that had his
name on it fell off the board,

1947
01:04:47.568 --> 01:04:50.526
and they only realised once
all thejobs had been given out,

1948
01:04:50.526 --> 01:04:52.693
so they had to make a job for him.

1949
01:04:52.693 --> 01:04:54.901
It’s Laura in Westminster.

1950
01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:56.485
Adam in Westminster.

1951
01:04:56.485 --> 01:04:57.901
And we’re joined in the studio...

1952
01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:00.526
By Selma Shah, former special
adviser to Sajid Javid.

1953
01:05:00.526 --> 01:05:01.901
who?

1954
01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:06.110
He used to be a thing
in Westminster.

1955
01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:08.776
I think he still might be
a thing, with a very

1956
01:05:08.776 --> 01:05:10.985
interesting few months ahead.

1957
01:05:10.985 --> 01:05:12.735
So...

1958
01:05:12.735 --> 01:05:15.610
It’s the thing all political
journalists and obsessives live for,

1959
01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:17.568
which is a reshuffle.
