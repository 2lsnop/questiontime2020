00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:04.443
Following the police discovery,
Shanur’s family went

2
00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:06.651
to the spot where he was found.

3
00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:09.484
They discovered his glasses
and blood stained tissue

4
00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.068
from the family home.

5
00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:15.484
I saw my son’s Versace
glasses there, and I was

6
00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:19.651
shocked, what police did.

7
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.401
Police say they are
looking for evidence.

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.609
They took so much time
to get the evidence,

9
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:28.693
why my son’s sunglasses there?

10
00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:31.901
The Met police have yet to respond
to the family’s claims.

11
00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:33.526
So far, no arrests have been made.

12
00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:38.693
Police are appealing for anyone
with information to come forward.

13
00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:41.193
Meanwhile, Shanur’s family
pray his killers are found

14
00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:44.193
and brought to justice.

16
00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:51.693
That’s it from us on BBC One.

17
00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:53.151
But we keep going on BBC

20
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:03.901
Now the weather from Chris.

21
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.318
Have a very good night, goodbye.

22
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.443
It turned out to be a miserable day,
what with all the cloud,

23
00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:13.484
cold wind and of course the rain
which lasted pretty much all day.

24
00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:15.609
Things get quieter overnight,
clear spells working their way

25
00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.359
down from the north,
rainy clearing off.

26
00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.484
It is going to be
a cold night, though.

27
00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:21.234
Temperatures getting close
to freezing and there

28
00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:24.318
could be a mist orfog patch
in the countryside with these low

29
00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:27.359
temperatures, so a chilly start
to the day on Friday but a much

30
00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:28.443
more straightforward day.

31
00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:29.651
Sunshine to start off with.

32
00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:31.568
The afternoon, a bit
of cloud bubbles up,

33
00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:34.443
the odd isolated shower,
but for most of us it stays dry

34
00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:36.859
throughout with spells of sunshine,
highs up to 11 degrees.

35
00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.484
The weekend weather prospects —
Saturday looks like a windy day,

36
00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:40.693
cloud increasing through the day.

37
00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:43.859
Sunday, rain to start off with,
but it should get brighter later on.

38
00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.026

This is no holiday,
it’s the adventure of a lifetime.

00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:15.776
Best mode of transport ever!

108
00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:18.068
I don’t know
if this is terrifying or fun.

109
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:20.443
It’s like therre putting on a show
just for us.

to the toilet before starting.

164
00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.859
We are pleased to have you here. We
are going take some 0 and a

165
00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:28.068
are going take some 0 and a
questions,

166
00:06:28.068 --> 00:06:30.818
are going take some 0 and 3
questions, quickfire, to hear the

167
00:06:30.818 --> 00:06:33.943
questions, quickfire, to hear the
concerns of you here. We will do the

168
00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:34.401
concerns of you here. We will do the
politic and

169
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:35.026
concerns of you here. We will do the
politics and challenges to the

170
00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:39.651
politics and challenges to the
Government, you won’t get of quite

171
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:44.443
Government, you won’t get of quite
that easily. But a general question

172
00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:45.068
that easily. But a general question
about coronavirus Jill

173
00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:47.318
that easily. But a general question
about coronavirusjill Pullin. How

174
00:06:47.318 --> 00:06:50.068
about coronavirusjill Pullin. How
concerned about coronavirus should

175
00:06:50.068 --> 00:06:50.734
concerned about coronavirus should
we be? Cleariy

176
00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:51.943
concerned about coronavirus should
we be? Clearly coronavirus is a huge

177
00:06:51.943 --> 00:06:52.484
we be? Cleariy coronavirus is a huge
challenge to the

178
00:06:52.484 --> 00:06:53.984
we be? Clearly coronavirus is a huge
challenge to the country. On behalf

179
00:06:53.984 --> 00:06:56.526
challenge to the country. On behalf
of everyone, I want to send our

180
00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:57.693
of everyone, I want to send our
deepest condolences to the family

181
00:06:57.693 --> 00:06:59.359
deepest condolences to the family
and the loved ones of the patient

182
00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:03.651
and the loved ones of the patient
who died today with coronavirus. I’m

183
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.693
who died today with coronavirus. I’m
sure that will be a worrying moment

184
00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:07.943
sure that will be a worrying moment
for lots of people and

185
00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:12.318
for lots of people and
understandably so. And I

186
00:07:12.318 --> 00:07:13.151
for lots of people and
understandably so. And Ifeel the

187
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:14.734
understandably so. And Ifeel the
responsibility deeply for getting

188
00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.693
responsibility deeply for getting
the Government response to this

189
00:07:16.693 --> 00:07:18.359
the Government response to this
right. The Government are the only

190
00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:21.526
right. The Government are the only
people who need to respond —— not

191
00:07:21.526 --> 00:07:22.109
people who need to respond -- not
the only people

192
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:22.693
people who need to respond —— not
the only people that need to

193
00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:24.276
the only people that need to
respond, we can all play a part in

194
00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:25.443
respond, we ran all play a part in
it. It is a

195
00:07:25.443 --> 00:07:26.818
respond, we can all play a part in
it. It is a perfectly reasonable for

196
00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:27.901
it. It is a perfectly reasonabla for
peopla to be

197
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:29.734
it. It is a perfectly reasonable for
people to be worried. Of course, for

198
00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:30.943
peopla to be worried. Of course, for
the majority of

199
00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:31.651
people to be worried. Of course, for
the majority of people, if they

200
00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:32.443
the majority of peopla, if they
catch

201
00:07:32.443 --> 00:07:34.609
the majority of people, if they
catch coronavirus, then it will be a

202
00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:36.318
catch coronavims, then it will be a
mild, relatively

203
00:07:36.318 --> 00:07:40.109
catch coronavirus, then it will be a
mild, relatively mild disease and

204
00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:41.859
mild, relatively mild disease and
the vast majority will fully

205
00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:45.109
the vast majority will fully
recover. And so from that point of

206
00:07:45.109 --> 00:07:47.318
recover. And so from that point of
view, for most people, this will be

207
00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:48.109
view, for most peopla, this will be
something akin

208
00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:50.068
view, for most people, this will be
something akin to getting the flu if

209
00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:50.818
something akin to getting the ﬂu if
they get it.

210
00:07:50.818 --> 00:07:52.609
something akin to getting the flu if
they get it. But obviously it is

211
00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:55.484
they get it. But obviously it is
also having some very significant

212
00:07:55.484 --> 00:07:57.359
also having some very significant
effects, both on the economy, in

213
00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:00.359
effects, both on the economy, in
terms of people... How they manage

214
00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:05.193
terms of people... How they manage
their daily lives. And for a small

215
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.359
their daily lives. And for a small
proportion of people, we estimate

216
00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:09.776
proportion of people, we estimate
around 1% of those who catch it,

217
00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:10.568
around 196 of those who match it,
then it is

218
00:08:10.568 --> 00:08:12.776
around 1% of those who catch it,
then it is fatal. So it is a very

219
00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:13.901
then it is fatal. So it is a very
serious consideration. The thing

220
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:15.359
serious consideration. The thing
that makes it more difficult is that

221
00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:19.234
that makes it more difficult is that
there is a virus, this disease is

222
00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:21.568
there is a virus, this disease is
new. That means that none of us have

223
00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:22.734
new. That means that none of us have
the natural antibodies that we have

224
00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:26.693
the natural antibodies that we have
to something like the flu. So it’s a

225
00:08:26.693 --> 00:08:26.984
to something like the ﬂu. So it’s a
serious

226
00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:27.901
to something like the flu. So it’s a
serious problem for the country and

227
00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:29.776
serious problem for the country and
all of us need to play our part and

228
00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:30.318
all of us need to play our part and
ran play our

229
00:08:30.318 --> 00:08:31.401
all of us need to play our part and
can play our part in making sure we

230
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:33.901
ran play our part in making sure we
as a country, and

231
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:34.484
can play our part in making sure we
as a country, and as a world,

232
00:08:34.484 --> 00:08:36.901
as a country, and as a world,
respond as well as we possibly can.

233
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:37.568
respond as well as we possibly ran.
(“an I ask,

234
00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:40.943
respond as well as we possibly can.
Can I ask, how worried are you? I’m

235
00:08:40.943 --> 00:08:41.318
(“an I ask, how worried are you? I’m
not personally

236
00:08:41.318 --> 00:08:41.651
Can I ask, how worried are you? I’m
not personally particularly worried

237
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.359
not personally particularly worried
because I feel I don’t fall into the

238
00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:45.318
because I feel I don’t fall into the
category where I should be majorly

239
00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:45.526
category where I should be majorty
concerned,

240
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:48.776
category where I should be majorly
concerned, from what I have read. It

241
00:08:48.776 --> 00:08:52.401
concerned, from what I have read. It
will be, for the majority of us,

242
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:53.526
will be, for the majority of us,
severe cold or flu—like symptoms.

243
00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:54.193
severe cold or ﬂu-like symptoms.
Yet a lot

244
00:08:54.193 --> 00:08:55.359
severe cold or flu—like symptoms.
Yet a lot of what you read implies

245
00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:58.359
Yet a lot of what you read implies
we should almost be barricading the

246
00:08:58.359 --> 00:08:59.151
we should almost be barriading the
door is. OK,

247
00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:00.484
we should almost be barricading the
door is. 0K, 0K, we will get into

248
00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:02.651
door is. 0K, 0K, we will get into
more specific things in a moment.

249
00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:04.193
more specific things in a moment.
Xand van Tulleken, how is afraid

250
00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:07.651
Xand van Tulleken, how is afraid
should we be? I think it is such a

251
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:08.818
should we be? I think it is such a
good question because everyone I

252
00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:11.484
good question because everyone I
know is wondering how to react to

253
00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:14.359
know is wondering how to react to
the news we are getting. The first

254
00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:16.276
the news we are getting. The first
death today, 100 cases, how serious

255
00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:16.859
death today, 100 cases, how serious
is it? I

256
00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:17.068
death today, 100 cases, how serious
is it? Iguess

257
00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:17.818
death today, 100 cases, how serious
is it? Iguessl

258
00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:18.609
death today, 100 cases, how serious
is it? I guess I would say there is

259
00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:24.776
is it? I guess I would say there is
an urgency and the fact that it is

260
00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:25.776
an urgency and the fact that it is
dominating the headlines is because

261
00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:28.526
dominating the headlines is because
every single person in the UK should

262
00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.776
every single person in the UK should
be changing their behaviour today.

263
00:09:30.776 --> 00:09:32.943
be changing their behaviour today.
The most important thing is hand

264
00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:34.651
The most important thing is hand
washing. Hand washing will not

265
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:36.568
washing. Hand washing will not
reduce your chances of catching it

266
00:09:36.568 --> 00:09:38.943
reduce your chances of catching it
to zero but will dramatically slow

267
00:09:38.943 --> 00:09:40.776
to zero but will dramatically slow
the spread. Slowing the spread is

268
00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:42.568
the spread. Slowing the spread is
very urgent because the number of

269
00:09:42.568 --> 00:09:42.734
very urgent because the number of
rases

270
00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:44.776
very urgent because the number of
cases doubles every few days. A few

271
00:09:44.776 --> 00:09:46.984
cases doubles every few days. A few
days ago we had 40—50 cases, now we

272
00:09:46.984 --> 00:09:47.776
days ago we had 40-50 cases, now we
have 100, in a

273
00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:49.609
days ago we had 40—50 cases, now we
have 100, in a few days’ time we

274
00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:49.984
have 100, in a few days“ time we
will have

275
00:09:49.984 --> 00:09:51.276
have 100, in a few days’ time we
will have 200 and that doubling may

276
00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:53.859
will have 200 and that doubling may
well keep going. As it doubles, as

277
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.484
well keep going. As it doubles, as
Matt said, a small proportion of

278
00:09:55.484 --> 00:09:58.234
Matt said, a small proportion of
those people, not necessarily the

279
00:09:58.234 --> 00:10:00.901
those people, not necessarily the
small proportion that die back 5% or

280
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.359
small proportion that die back 596 or
101: will.

281
00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.776
small proportion that die back 5% or
10% will need intensive care or at

282
00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:03.526
1096 will need intensive rare or at
least a high

283
00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:04.276
10% will need intensive care or at
least a high dependency unit. Those

284
00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:06.276
least a high dependency unit. Those
beds are in short supply at the

285
00:10:06.276 --> 00:10:08.151
beds are in short supply at the
moment in the NHS, as they always

286
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:09.984
moment in the NHS, as they always
are. So the more we can spread

287
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.484
are. So the more we ran spread
things out, the

288
00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:12.026
are. So the more we can spread
things out, the more likely it is we

289
00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:13.484
things out, the more likely it is we
ran provide rare

290
00:10:13.484 --> 00:10:14.568
things out, the more likely it is we
can provide care to everyone that

291
00:10:14.568 --> 00:10:14.693
ran provide rare to everyone that
needs

292
00:10:14.693 --> 00:10:16.484
can provide care to everyone that
needs and keep mortality as low as

293
00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.651
needs and keep mortality as low as
low as possible. That is the

294
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:19.443
low as possible. That is the
urgency. Everyone should be

295
00:10:19.443 --> 00:10:21.443
urgency. Everyone should be
invested. There are other things you

296
00:10:21.443 --> 00:10:22.151
invested. There are other things you
ran do. You

297
00:10:22.151 --> 00:10:23.401
invested. There are other things you
can do. You should be hygienic in

298
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:23.776
ran do. You should be hygienic in
terms of

299
00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:25.859
can do. You should be hygienic in
terms of catching and killing

300
00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.151
terms of catching and killing
sneezes and coughs, wiping surfaces.

301
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:29.359
sneezes and coughs, wiping surfaces.
I think everyone should be

302
00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:31.359
I think everyone should be
self—monitoring. If you are

303
00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:35.693
self—monitoring. If you are
concerned, even more normal avoid or

304
00:10:35.693 --> 00:10:37.276
concerned, even more normal avoid or
infecting other people. Matt and I

305
00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:37.526
infecting other peopla. Matt and I
properly

306
00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:38.568
infecting other people. Matt and I
properly don’t disagree with theirs,

307
00:10:38.568 --> 00:10:38.943
property don’t disagree with theirs,
I think

308
00:10:38.943 --> 00:10:40.943
properly don’t disagree with theirs,
I think the Government has been very

309
00:10:40.943 --> 00:10:43.734
I think the Government has been very
sensible at providing good quality

310
00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:44.776
sensible at providing good quality
evidence—based information.

311
00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:45.984
evidence—based information.
Personally, I like not handshaking.

312
00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:49.068
Personally, I like not handshaking.
Not because it may not stop the

313
00:10:49.068 --> 00:10:50.484
Not because it may not stop the
spread but it makes you think when

314
00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:52.068
spread but it makes you think when
you walk into a room, we’ll

315
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.359
spread but it makes you think when
you walk into a room, we’lljust met

316
00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:53.943
you walk into a room, we’ll just met
backstage and I

317
00:10:53.943 --> 00:10:54.401
you walk into a room, we’lljust met
backstage and I wouldn’t shake

318
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:56.026
backstage and I wouldn’t shake
anyone because my hand and it made

319
00:10:56.026 --> 00:10:57.776
anyone because my hand and it made
it intensely awkward as everyone was

320
00:10:57.776 --> 00:10:59.359
it intensely awkward as everyone was
suddenly talking about coronavirus.

321
00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:01.276
suddenly talking about coronavirus.
I like that. Then you get out the

322
00:11:01.276 --> 00:11:02.984
I like that. Then you get out the
alcohol gel and think about it. You

323
00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:03.484
alcohol gel and think about it. You
ran do air

324
00:11:03.484 --> 00:11:06.234
alcohol gel and think about it. You
can do air kisses, you can do a

325
00:11:06.234 --> 00:11:06.776
ran do air kisses, you ran do a
little hug, a

326
00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:07.818
can do air kisses, you can do a
little hug, a bow wave, and knuckle

327
00:11:07.818 --> 00:11:08.151
little hug, a bow wave, and knuckle
bump, however

328
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:09.484
little hug, a bow wave, and knuckle
bump, howeveryou

329
00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:10.068
little hug, a bow wave, and knuckle
bump, however you want to greet

330
00:11:10.068 --> 00:11:10.526
bump, however you want to greet
people. I

331
00:11:10.526 --> 00:11:10.734
bump, however you want to greet
people. Ilike

332
00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:12.401
bump, however you want to greet
people. I like an elbow bump but all

333
00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:12.651
peopla. I like an elbow bump but all
that

334
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:14.068
people. I like an elbow bump but all
that makes people conscious of

335
00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:15.401
that makes people conscious of
hygiene. Everyone should be

336
00:11:15.401 --> 00:11:17.901
hygiene. Everyone should be
invested, no one shall panic. And

337
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:19.943
invested, no one shall panic. And
you will be demonstrating those

338
00:11:19.943 --> 00:11:23.318
you will be demonstrating those
things later, Xand! Margaret, how

339
00:11:23.318 --> 00:11:26.484
things later, Xand! Margaret, how
worried should we be? I don’t think

340
00:11:26.484 --> 00:11:28.734
worried should we be? I don’t think
we should be afraid but I think we

341
00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:31.734
we should be afraid but I think we
should be wary and cautious and look

342
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:33.401
should be wary and cautious and look
for sound information. One of the

343
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.568
for sound information. One of the
things that strikes me forcibly is

344
00:11:35.568 --> 00:11:37.776
things that strikes me forcibly is
that this is going to illuminate all

345
00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:40.401
that this is going to illuminate all
the problems we’ve already got in

346
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:40.734
the problams we’ve already got in
our

347
00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:41.984
the problems we’ve already got in
our health service, which we know it

348
00:11:41.984 --> 00:11:44.443
our health service, which we know it
is underfunded and all those things.

349
00:11:44.443 --> 00:11:46.651
is underfunded and all those things.
And it will bring a lot of that

350
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:48.651
And it will bring a lot of that
time. So I think this is going to

351
00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:50.901
time. So I think this is going to
be, apart from anything is, a period

352
00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:51.359
be, apart from anything is, a period
where peopla

353
00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:53.026
be, apart from anything is, a period
where people can learn about each

354
00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:53.901
where people ran learn about each
other, about

355
00:11:53.901 --> 00:11:55.276
where people can learn about each
other, about what the country’s

356
00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:55.526
other, about what the countrrs
problams

357
00:11:55.526 --> 00:11:56.734
other, about what the country’s
problems are, what we need to

358
00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:58.359
problems are, what we need to
resolve them and that I think in

359
00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:00.276
resolve them and that I think in
itself will be important. 50 I don’t

360
00:12:00.276 --> 00:12:00.734
itself will be important. So I don’t
think we

361
00:12:00.734 --> 00:12:02.359
itself will be important. 50 I don’t
think we should go about in fear and

362
00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:04.068
think we should go about in fear and
dread but I don’t think we ought to

363
00:12:04.068 --> 00:12:09.109
dread but I don’t think we ought to
be silly, either. Tim? I noticed all

364
00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:09.651
be silly, either. Tim? I noticed all
the loo roll

365
00:12:09.651 --> 00:12:10.484
be silly, either. Tim? I noticed all
the [00 roll has gone in my

366
00:12:10.484 --> 00:12:11.276
be silly, either. Tim? I noticed all
the loo roll has gone in my local

367
00:12:11.276 --> 00:12:11.943
the loo roll has gone in my [oral
supermarket,

368
00:12:11.943 --> 00:12:13.193
the [00 roll has gone in my local
supermarket, and so is the hand gel

369
00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:14.568
supermarket, and so is the hand gel
as well. I don’t know why people

370
00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.776
as well. I don’t know why peopla
have gone for

371
00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:16.776
as well. I don’t know why people
have gone for the loo roll, I don’t

372
00:12:16.776 --> 00:12:17.151
have gone for the loo roll, I don’t
want to

373
00:12:17.151 --> 00:12:20.568
have gone for the [00 roll, I don’t
want to know! I can’t think for love

374
00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:22.693
want to know! I can’t think for love
nor money. I think the Government is

375
00:12:22.693 --> 00:12:23.984
nor money. I think the Government is
getting it about right, walking a

376
00:12:23.984 --> 00:12:26.026
getting it about right, walking a
fine line between getting people

377
00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:26.984
fine line between getting people
ready and getting people conscious

378
00:12:26.984 --> 00:12:27.193
ready and getting peopla conscious
of

379
00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:28.443
ready and getting people conscious
of the way they are behaving but

380
00:12:28.443 --> 00:12:30.401
of the way they are behaving but
also not causing too much alarm

381
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:32.401
also not causing too much alarm
because there is always a risk you

382
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:33.943
because there is always a risk you
generate so much alarm, that that

383
00:12:33.943 --> 00:12:36.151
generate so much alarm, that that
actually does more damage than the

384
00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:37.693
actually does more damage than the
virus itself, at least economically.

385
00:12:37.693 --> 00:12:40.234
virus itself, at least economically.
We don’t want our way of life to be

386
00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:42.151
We don’t want our way of life to be
changed forever. That is always what

387
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:43.734
changed forever. That is always what
one is conscious about trying to

388
00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:46.568
one is conscious about trying to
avoid. I want to be able to go back

389
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:48.234
avoid. I want to be able to go back
to shaking hands. I’m not going to

390
00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:49.984
to shaking hands. I’m not going to
walk around doing that all day. I

391
00:12:49.984 --> 00:12:52.234
walk around doing that all day. I
want things to go back to normal as

392
00:12:52.234 --> 00:12:54.526
want things to go back to normal as
soon as possible and therefore any

393
00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:55.776
soon as possible and therefore any
short—term inconvenience we have to

394
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:56.109
short-term inconvenience we have to
accept, fair

395
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.318
short—term inconvenience we have to
accept, fair enough. The goal is to

396
00:12:58.318 --> 00:12:59.943
accept, fair enough. The goal is to
keep ralm, tarry

397
00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:00.651
accept, fair enough. The goal is to
keep calm, carry on, not get

398
00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:02.818
keep calm, carry on, not get
hysterical, because that’s kind of

399
00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:05.901
hysterical, because that’s kind of
what defines Britain. Layla Moran? I

400
00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:06.568
what defines Britain. layla Moran? I
think like you,

401
00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:08.026
what defines Britain. Layla Moran? I
think like you, for myself I’m not

402
00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:09.318
think like you, for myself I’m not
actually that worried. I’m young and

403
00:13:09.318 --> 00:13:11.193
actually that worried. I’m young and
healthy and that I get it there is a

404
00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:15.193
healthy and that I get it there is a
very good chance I will be OK. But I

405
00:13:15.193 --> 00:13:15.318
healthy and that I get it there is a
very good chance I will be OK. But I

406
00:13:15.318 --> 00:13:18.276
very good chance I will be OK. But I
am worried for particularly my

407
00:13:18.276 --> 00:13:18.443
am worried for particularty my
elderty

408
00:13:18.443 --> 00:13:19.234
am worried for particularly my
elderly grandparents, people who are

409
00:13:19.234 --> 00:13:19.484
elderty grandparents, peopla who are
more

410
00:13:19.484 --> 00:13:22.818
elderly grandparents, people who are
more vulnerable. People who perhaps

411
00:13:22.818 --> 00:13:24.068
more vulnerable. People who perhaps
don’t have the same resilience

412
00:13:24.068 --> 00:13:25.651
don’t have the same resilience
financially as I do. I’ve been doing

413
00:13:25.651 --> 00:13:29.401
financially as I do. I’ve been doing
a lot of work in the last few days,

414
00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:31.484
a lot of work in the last few days,

on zero—hours contract and the gig
economy, who have to think hard

economy, who have to think hard
about do I go to work today or do I

423
00:13:40.193 --> 00:13:42.526
about do I go to work today or do I
do the right thing for other people,

424
00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:42.943
do the right thing for other peopla,
which is

425
00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:44.276
do the right thing for other people,
which is to self—isolate if they

426
00:13:44.276 --> 00:13:44.734
which is to self-isolate if they
have no

427
00:13:44.734 --> 00:13:46.068
which is to self—isolate if they
have no symptoms and they have been

428
00:13:46.068 --> 00:13:47.818
have no symptoms and they have been
in contact with someone. All credit

429
00:13:47.818 --> 00:13:49.484
in contact with someone. All credit
to the Government, they have been

430
00:13:49.484 --> 00:13:51.526
to the Government, they have been
listening and they have now changed

431
00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:53.526
listening and they have now changed
those rules. 50 we are trying to all

432
00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:54.193
those mles. So we are trying to all
work together

433
00:13:54.193 --> 00:13:56.568
those rules. 50 we are trying to all
work together on this. I think that

434
00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:57.359
work together on this. I think that
is really important, that

435
00:13:57.359 --> 00:13:59.526
is really important, that
politicians at a time like this do

436
00:13:59.526 --> 00:13:59.818
politicians at a time like this do
our

437
00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:02.443
politicians at a time like this do
ourjobs and talk about the most

438
00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:03.818
ourjobs and talk about the most
vulnerable constituents that we

439
00:14:03.818 --> 00:14:05.609
vulnerable constituents that we
have. The other people I really do

440
00:14:05.609 --> 00:14:06.526
have. The other peopla I really do
worry about

441
00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:07.443
have. The other people I really do
worry about are people like the

442
00:14:07.443 --> 00:14:09.693
worry about are people like the
homeless. I was talking to people in

443
00:14:09.693 --> 00:14:11.526
homeless. I was talking to people in
the sector today who are concerned,

444
00:14:11.526 --> 00:14:13.693
the sector today who are concerned,
and I say this talking to Matt, they

445
00:14:13.693 --> 00:14:15.984
and I say this talking to Matt, they
haven’t had guidance about what to

446
00:14:15.984 --> 00:14:16.859
haven’t had guidance about what to
do for peopla,

447
00:14:16.859 --> 00:14:17.276
haven’t had guidance about what to
do for people, particularly rough

448
00:14:17.276 --> 00:14:17.359
do for people, particularty rough
sleepers.

449
00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:18.943
do for people, particularly rough
sleepers. You have to think, if you

450
00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:21.109
sleepers. You have to think, if you
don’t have a home, how do you

451
00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:22.276
don’t have a home, how do you
self—isolate? I can see you are

452
00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:22.859
self-isolate? I ran see you are
writing that

453
00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:24.359
self—isolate? I can see you are
writing that damn, I hope you take

454
00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:26.776
writing that damn, I hope you take
that back. At a time like this, we

455
00:14:26.776 --> 00:14:27.859
that back. At a time like this, we
perform a really important

456
00:14:27.859 --> 00:14:28.359
that back. At a time like this, we
perform a really importantjob,

457
00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:30.068
perform a really importantjob,
which is to ask the right questions

458
00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:31.484
which is to ask the right questions
on behalf of the people that we

459
00:14:31.484 --> 00:14:33.359
on behalf of the people that we
serve and the job of the Government

460
00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:38.526
serve and the job of the Government
I think it’s to respond and listen.

461
00:14:38.526 --> 00:14:40.151
I think it’s to respond and listen.
0K. There is a lot of very practical

462
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:41.318
0K. There is a lot of very practical
questions that many of you have

463
00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:43.068
questions that many of you have
asked. I will do a kind of for want

464
00:14:43.068 --> 00:14:43.693
asked. I will do a kind offor want
of a better

465
00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:44.734
asked. I will do a kind of for want
of a better phrase, a quickfire

466
00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:46.901
of a better phrase, a quickfire
round to you, Matt, if I may. A

467
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:47.818
round to you, Matt, ifI may. A
quick question

468
00:14:47.818 --> 00:14:48.359
round to you, Matt, if I may. A
quick question and a reasonably

469
00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:50.026
quick question and a reasonably
brief answer. I want to get in as

470
00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:52.109
brief answer. I want to get in as
many as I ran,

471
00:14:52.109 --> 00:14:52.234
brief answer. I want to get in as
many as I can,Jim

472
00:14:52.234 --> 00:14:53.276
brief answer. I want to get in as
many as I can, Jim Docherty? With

473
00:14:53.276 --> 00:14:53.693
many as I ran, jim Docherty? with
the first

474
00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.484
many as I can, Jim Docherty? With
the first death today, should we now

475
00:14:55.484 --> 00:14:57.609
the first death today, should we now
be preventing large gatherings at

476
00:14:57.609 --> 00:15:00.859
be preventing large gatherings at
sport events and theatres? We are

477
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.984
sport events and theatres? We are
looking into the exact science of

478
00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:06.901
looking into the exact science of
what the approach should be as the

479
00:15:06.901 --> 00:15:08.484
what the approach should be as the
numbers grow. We are still in the

480
00:15:08.484 --> 00:15:11.109
numbers grow. We are still in the
phase where we are trying to contain

481
00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:15.359
phase where we are trying to contain
this virus, but also exactly as Xand

482
00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:16.818
this virus, but also exactly as Xand
said, delaying the onset has a big

483
00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:20.276
said, delaying the onset has a big
benefit, in terms of the impact on

484
00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:21.901
benefit, in terms of the impact on
the NHS. Actually, the more we look

485
00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:24.276
the NHS. Actually, the more we look
at the science of this particular

486
00:15:24.276 --> 00:15:28.234
at the science of this particular
virus, the more it is clear that the

487
00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:28.484
virus, the more it is clear that the
large-scale

488
00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:31.234
virus, the more it is clear that the
large—scale events are not

489
00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:32.526
large—scale events are not
necessarily as big spreaders as a

490
00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:34.859
necessarily as big spreaders as a
lot of people think. The reason for

491
00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:35.818
lot of peopla think. The reason for
that is the way

492
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:36.526
lot of people think. The reason for
that is the way that this virus

493
00:15:36.526 --> 00:15:40.734
that is the way that this virus
transmit is through... It’s

494
00:15:40.734 --> 00:15:41.734
transmit is through... It’s
respiratory, so close proximity. So

495
00:15:41.734 --> 00:15:45.901
respiratory, so close proximity. So
if you are outdoors and you have the

496
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:49.734
if you are outdoors and you have the
virus, then you would still only be

497
00:15:49.734 --> 00:15:51.484
virus, then you would still only be
affecting the people near to you. So

498
00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:53.193
affecting the people near to you. So
the most important thing is to get

499
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:55.484
the most important thing is to get
the message that people that have

500
00:15:55.484 --> 00:15:58.901
the message that people that have
the virus and have the symptoms need

501
00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:03.359
the virus and have the symptoms need
to self—isolate. So following the

502
00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:03.484
to self-isolate. So following the
science

503
00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:05.776
to self—isolate. 50 following the
science is absolutely at the heart

504
00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:08.943
science is absolutely at the heart
of the Government’s response. If I

505
00:16:08.943 --> 00:16:12.609
of the Government’s response. If I
just also respond to the point from

506
00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:13.276
just also respond to the point from
layla,

507
00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:15.193
just also respond to the point from
Layla, complete entry about how the

508
00:16:15.193 --> 00:16:16.193
Layla, complete entry about how the
Government is responding. Cross

509
00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:17.818
Government is responding. Cross
party in government, I have never

510
00:16:17.818 --> 00:16:19.859
party in government, I have never
seen the Government come together

511
00:16:19.859 --> 00:16:22.734
seen the Government come together
like this, to find the right

512
00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:23.693
like this, to find the right
scientific response to this crisis

513
00:16:23.693 --> 00:16:25.318
scientific response to this crisis
and try to bring the country

514
00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.318
and try to bring the country
together. Another question from

515
00:16:28.318 --> 00:16:31.901
together. Another question from
Thomas? How will the Government

516
00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:34.859
Thomas? How will the Government
support those who self—isolate due

517
00:16:34.859 --> 00:16:35.359
support those who self-isolate due
to

518
00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:36.484
support those who self—isolate due
to coronavirus who aren’t entitled

519
00:16:36.484 --> 00:16:37.109
to coronavirus who aren’t entiﬂad
to statutory

520
00:16:37.109 --> 00:16:40.109
to coronavirus who aren’t entitled
to statutory sick pay, like those on

521
00:16:40.109 --> 00:16:40.984
to statutory sick pay, like those on
zero—hours contracts? It’s an

522
00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:41.151
zero-hours contracts? It’s an
incredibly

523
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:42.151
zero—hours contracts? It’s an
incredibly important question and we

524
00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:44.401
incredibly important question and we
have said that people should not be

525
00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:45.276
have said that peopla should not be
penalised for

526
00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:46.484
have said that people should not be
penalised for doing the right thing.

527
00:16:46.484 --> 00:16:48.151
penalised for doing the right thing.
So we will change the rules on

528
00:16:48.151 --> 00:16:48.359
So we will change the mles on
statutory

529
00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:49.859
So we will change the rules on
statutory sick pay but we are also

530
00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:52.359
statutory sick pay but we are also
working on making sure that people

531
00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:53.693
working on making sure that peopla
who are say

532
00:16:53.693 --> 00:16:54.776
working on making sure that people
who are say self—employed or in an

533
00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:54.901
who are say self-employed or in an
employment

534
00:16:54.901 --> 00:16:55.776
who are say self—employed or in an
employment contract that doesn’t

535
00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:57.776
employment contract that doesn’t
allow them to get statutory sick pay

536
00:16:57.776 --> 00:17:00.776
allow them to get statutory sick pay
because they don’t earn the minimum

537
00:17:00.776 --> 00:17:02.359
because they don’t earn the minimum
amount, maybe because they don’t

538
00:17:02.359 --> 00:17:04.526
amount, maybe because they don’t
work full—time, to make sure that

539
00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:05.359
work full-time, to make sure that
they get the

540
00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.401
work full—time, to make sure that
they get the support they need as

541
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.151
they get the support they need as
well. Financial

542
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:08.776
they get the support they need as
well. Financialsupport

543
00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:09.276
they get the support they need as
well. Financial support from the

544
00:17:09.276 --> 00:17:11.359
well. Financial support from the
Government? Yes. If we as government

545
00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.943
Government? Yes. If we as government
are asking people to self—isolate,

546
00:17:13.943 --> 00:17:14.734
are asking peopla to self-isolate,
then they

547
00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:15.859
are asking people to self—isolate,
then they shouldn’t be penalised for

548
00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.318
then they shouldn’t be penalised for
doing the right thing, which is good

549
00:17:17.318 --> 00:17:19.776
doing the right thing, which is good
for them but good for the whole

550
00:17:19.776 --> 00:17:20.734
for them but good for the whola
community.

551
00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:22.859
for them but good for the whole
community. When can we expect an

552
00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.568
community. When can we expect an
announcement on that? The Prime

553
00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:26.401
announcement on that? The Prime
Minister made the announcement

554
00:17:26.401 --> 00:17:27.943
Minister made the announcement
yesterday in broad terms and I’m

555
00:17:27.943 --> 00:17:31.401
yesterday in broad terms and I’m
working with the DWP secretary in

556
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.776
working with the DWP secretary in
the Business Secretary to get the

557
00:17:32.776 --> 00:17:34.234
the Business Secretary to get the
exact rules of that right and then

558
00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.568
exact mles of that right and then
they will go

559
00:17:36.568 --> 00:17:37.776
exact rules of that right and then
they will go through Parliament.

560
00:17:37.776 --> 00:17:39.943
they will go through Parliament.
Andrew Flintoff? If I get

561
00:17:39.943 --> 00:17:42.568
Andrew Flintoff? If I get
coronavirus, how should I

562
00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:44.776
coronavirus, how should I
self—isolate from my family? Another

563
00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:44.984
self-isolate from my family? Another
important

564
00:17:44.984 --> 00:17:46.234
self—isolate from my family? Another
important question. People should

565
00:17:46.234 --> 00:17:47.984
important question. People should
try to self—isolate from their

566
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.109
try to self—isolate from their
families. 50 not only go home, try

567
00:17:51.109 --> 00:17:54.484
families. So not only go home, try
not to go out for

568
00:17:54.484 --> 00:17:54.859
families. 50 not only go home, try
not to go out for instance shopping,

569
00:17:54.859 --> 00:17:56.359
not to go out for instance shopping,
definitely don’t use public

570
00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.651
definitely don’t use public
transport. But within your home, you

571
00:17:57.651 --> 00:18:00.401
transport. But within your home, you
should also try to isolate. Look,

572
00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:02.484
should also try to isolate. Look,
I’m a father of three children, I

573
00:18:02.484 --> 00:18:03.859
I’m a father of three children, I
understand that that can be

574
00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:06.276
understand that that can be
difficult and some people have

575
00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:06.401
difficult and some peopla have
raring

576
00:18:06.401 --> 00:18:07.776
difficult and some people have
caring responsibilities. But as much

577
00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:08.151
raring responsibilities. But as much
as possible,

578
00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:09.859
caring responsibilities. But as much
as possible, stay on your own, even

579
00:18:09.859 --> 00:18:12.318
as possible, stay on your own, even
within your own home. So practical

580
00:18:12.318 --> 00:18:14.859
within your own home. So practical
things like sharing a bathroom, 3

581
00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:16.568
things like sharing a bathroom, a
kitchen?

582
00:18:16.568 --> 00:18:19.359
things like sharing a bathroom, 3
kitchen? So long as you wash your

583
00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:20.943
kitchen? So long as you wash your
hands and wipe down surfaces that

584
00:18:20.943 --> 00:18:25.818
hands and wipe down surfaces that
you use, you can take these

585
00:18:25.818 --> 00:18:26.109
you use, you ran take these
precautions.

586
00:18:26.109 --> 00:18:29.068
you use, you can take these
precautions. Obviously, there are

587
00:18:29.068 --> 00:18:31.818
precautions. Obviously, there are
practicalities but the strong advice

588
00:18:31.818 --> 00:18:34.484
practicalities but the strong advice
is to come you possibly can, even

589
00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:35.234
is to come you possibly ran, even
within your own

590
00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:37.026
is to come you possibly can, even
within your own home if you are self

591
00:18:37.026 --> 00:18:38.359
within your own home if you are self
isolating, keep yourself to

592
00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:45.359
isolating, keep yourself to
yourself. 0K, Nicola? The media seem

593
00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:48.109
yourself. 0K, Nicola? The media seem
to help create panic buying. How do

594
00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:49.734
to help create panic buying. How do
we stop causing shortages caused by

595
00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:50.359
we stop causing shortages raused by
this?

596
00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:53.151
we stop causing shortages caused by
this? We have already heard about

597
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:53.526
this? We have already heard about
the loo

598
00:18:53.526 --> 00:18:54.901
this? We have already heard about
the [00 roll! There is

599
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:55.484
this? We have already heard about
the loo roll! There is absolutely no

600
00:18:55.484 --> 00:18:58.151
the loo roll! There is absolutely no
need for individuals to go around

601
00:18:58.151 --> 00:19:00.693
need for individuals to go around
buying more than they need. In fact,

602
00:19:00.693 --> 00:19:03.068
buying more than they need. In fact,
part of the response to this has to

603
00:19:03.068 --> 00:19:04.568
part of the response to this has to
be is coming together. We are after

604
00:19:04.568 --> 00:19:06.359
be is coming together. We are after
all I heard,

605
00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:06.484
be is coming together. We are after
alll heard, it

606
00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:07.776
be is coming together. We are after
all I heard, it is biology that is

607
00:19:07.776 --> 00:19:12.859
all I heard, it is biology that is
causing the problem. And so the

608
00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:15.484
causing the problem. And so the
very, very strong advice from the

609
00:19:15.484 --> 00:19:16.484
very, very strong advice from the
scientists, from the medic says

610
00:19:16.484 --> 00:19:17.318
scientists, from the medic says
peopla

611
00:19:17.318 --> 00:19:18.234
scientists, from the medic says
people should not go about buying

612
00:19:18.234 --> 00:19:18.484
peopla should not go about buying
more

613
00:19:18.484 --> 00:19:23.526
people should not go about buying
more than they need. I went to the

614
00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:25.484
more than they need. I went to the
supermarket today. Pasta, no pasta,

615
00:19:25.484 --> 00:19:27.734
supermarket today. Pasta, no pasta,
no dried pasta at all, no toilet

616
00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:29.651
no dried pasta at all, no toilet
rolls as you said earlier, Tim

617
00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:30.318
rolls as you said eartier, Tim
Foster

618
00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:31.276
rolls as you said earlier, Tim
Foster people are panic buying.

619
00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:31.859
Foster peopla are panic buying.
There is

620
00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:32.734
Foster people are panic buying.
There is no paracetamol or anything

621
00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:35.318
There is no paracetamol or anything
like that that you can get in the

622
00:19:35.318 --> 00:19:37.734
like that that you can get in the
supermarkets. I understand that but

623
00:19:37.734 --> 00:19:40.693
supermarkets. I understand that but
what I would say is the Government

624
00:19:40.693 --> 00:19:43.859
what I would say is the Government
has supplies of the key things that

625
00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:48.234
has supplies of the key things that
are needed and within the food

626
00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:48.484
are needed and within the food
sunplv.

627
00:19:48.484 --> 00:19:50.359
are needed and within the food
supply, we are absolutely confident

628
00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:52.151
supply, we are absolutely confident
that people will, that there won’t

629
00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:52.484
that peopla will, that there won’t
be a

630
00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.526
that people will, that there won’t
be a problem there. And crucially,

631
00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.109
be a problem there. And crucially,
we are working with the supermarkets

632
00:19:56.109 --> 00:19:58.818
we are working with the supermarkets
to make sure that if people are self

633
00:19:58.818 --> 00:19:59.359
to make sure that if peopla are self
isolating, then

634
00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:01.151
to make sure that if people are self
isolating, then we will be able to

635
00:20:01.151 --> 00:20:02.526
isolating, then we will be able to
get the food and supplies that they

636
00:20:02.526 --> 00:20:07.484
get the food and supplies that they
need.

637
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:11.276
Louis Mayes? Is a student about to
sit A—levels for a place at

638
00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:11.484
sit A-levels for a place at
university,

639
00:20:11.484 --> 00:20:12.818
sit A—levels for a place at
university, what will happen if our

640
00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:14.193
university, what will happen if our
exams are cut short by the

641
00:20:14.193 --> 00:20:16.484
exams are cut short by the
coronavirus? This is another

642
00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:17.859
coronavirus? This is another
important one. We are doing

643
00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:19.651
important one. We are doing
everything we can to prevent that

644
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:20.401
everything we ran to prevent that
happening,

645
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:21.276
everything we can to prevent that
happening, subject to keeping people

646
00:20:21.276 --> 00:20:26.026
happening, subject to keeping people
safe. The overall principle is that

647
00:20:26.026 --> 00:20:26.484
safe. The overall principla is that
the first

648
00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:27.943
safe. The overall principle is that
the first priority is to keep people

649
00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:29.526
the first priority is to keep people
safe, and I

650
00:20:29.526 --> 00:20:30.276
the first priority is to keep people
safe, and Ifeel that very

651
00:20:30.276 --> 00:20:30.859
the first priority is to keep people
safe, and I feel that very keenly.

652
00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:33.901
safe, and I feel that very keenly.
But we also want to minimise the

653
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:34.984
But we also want to minimise the
social and economic disruption.

654
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.984
social and economic disruption.
Hence, unlike some other countries

655
00:20:36.984 --> 00:20:38.234
Hence, unlike some other countries
that have done this, the scientific

656
00:20:38.234 --> 00:20:40.776
that have done this, the scientific
advice is clear not to close schools

657
00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:42.609
advice is clear not to dose schools
and colleges.

658
00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:45.193
advice is clear not to close schools
and colleges. The message to schools

659
00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:48.401
and colleges. The message to schools
is, don’t close unless you have

660
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:49.443
is, don’t close unless you have
specifically had advice from Public

661
00:20:49.443 --> 00:20:51.401
specifically had advice from Public
Health England to do so was that as

662
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:53.818
Health England to do so was that as
we come into exam season, obviously

663
00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:57.276
we come into exam season, obviously
we are monitoring that closely and

664
00:20:57.276 --> 00:20:58.984
we are monitoring that closely and
the education department is doing a

665
00:20:58.984 --> 00:20:59.818
the education department is doing a
fantastic job in

666
00:20:59.818 --> 00:21:00.401
the education department is doing a
fantasticjob in keeping the school

667
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:00.568
fantastic job in keeping the school
system

668
00:21:00.568 --> 00:21:04.276
fantasticjob in keeping the school
system running. But as we get to

669
00:21:04.276 --> 00:21:04.651
system mnning. But as we get to
exams, we

670
00:21:04.651 --> 00:21:06.109
system running. But as we get to
exams, we will do all we can to

671
00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:06.193
exams, we will do all we ran to
allow

672
00:21:06.193 --> 00:21:09.276
exams, we will do all we can to
allow that to proceed. But of

673
00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:10.484
allow that to proceed. But of
course, you will understand that if

674
00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:11.776
course, you will understand that if
we have to take action to keep

675
00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:15.109
we have to take action to keep
people safe, we are prepared to do

676
00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:17.443
people safe, we are prepared to do
that. One more before I throw it

677
00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.901
that. One more before I throw it
open. Oliver Carter. What are the

678
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:20.568
open. Oliver Carter. what are the
government

679
00:21:20.568 --> 00:21:21.901
open. Oliver Carter. What are the
government doing to tackle the

680
00:21:21.901 --> 00:21:25.068
government doing to tackle the
waiting time for coronavirus tests?

681
00:21:25.068 --> 00:21:27.151
waiting time for coronavirus tests?
Yes, getting the test results back

682
00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:30.109
Yes, getting the test results back
is obviously important. I know

683
00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:34.234
is obviously important. I know
friends of mine who have had the

684
00:21:34.234 --> 00:21:35.651
friends of mine who have had the
tests. Lots of people have talked to

685
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:36.109
tests. Lots of peopla have talked to
me about

686
00:21:36.109 --> 00:21:38.276
tests. Lots of people have talked to
me about it. We are getting a new

687
00:21:38.276 --> 00:21:39.651
me about it. We are getting a new
Tech solution into be able to get

688
00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:41.526
Tech solution into be able to get
the results back to people much

689
00:21:41.526 --> 00:21:43.359
the results back to people much
quicker bust—up and we have a lot of

690
00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:45.276
quicker bust-up and we have a lot of
peopla on it. So I

691
00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:46.193
quicker bust—up and we have a lot of
people on it. So I get it and we are

692
00:21:46.193 --> 00:21:46.651
peopla on it. So I get it and we are
trying to

693
00:21:46.651 --> 00:21:47.943
people on it. So I get it and we are
trying to make sure that happens as

694
00:21:47.943 --> 00:21:50.443
trying to make sure that happens as
quickly as possible. I am going to

695
00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:51.609
quickly as possible. I am going to
go to the audience. Is there

696
00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:54.609
go to the audience. Is there
anything any of you are burning to

697
00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:57.318
anything any of you are burning to
are layla? It is

698
00:21:57.318 --> 00:21:58.693
anything any of you are burning to
are Layla? It is more important than

699
00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:01.359
are Layla? It is more important than
ever to listen to experts. Thank

700
00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:02.484
ever to listen to experts. Thank
goodness for experts and thank

701
00:22:02.484 --> 00:22:05.859
goodness for experts and thank
goodness for scientists. We all have

702
00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.943
goodness for scientists. We all have
to be mindful of what we are reading

703
00:22:07.943 --> 00:22:09.651
to be mindful of what we are reading
on Facebook, what we are reading on

704
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:11.818
on Facebook, what we are reading on
Twitter, what we might read in

705
00:22:11.818 --> 00:22:15.901
Twitter, what we might read in
certain newspapers. Newspapers are

706
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:17.443
certain newspapers. Newspapers are
partly responsible for panic buying.

707
00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:19.109
partly responsible for panic buying.
You have a choice. You can choose to

708
00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:20.818
You have a choice. You can choose to
buy them or not if you see that they

709
00:22:20.818 --> 00:22:23.484
buy them or not if you see that they
are stoking this. We have to become,

710
00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:25.609
are stoking this. We have to become,
but listen to the people who know

711
00:22:25.609 --> 00:22:25.818
but listen to the peopla who know
what

712
00:22:25.818 --> 00:22:28.818
but listen to the people who know
what they are talking about,

713
00:22:28.818 --> 00:22:29.651
what they are talking about,
epidemiologists, doctors who know

714
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:30.109
epidemiologist, doctors who know
their

715
00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:32.443
epidemiologists, doctors who know
their stuff.

716
00:22:32.443 --> 00:22:33.068
epidemiologists, doctors who know
theirstuff. I’m

717
00:22:33.068 --> 00:22:33.859
epidemiologists, doctors who know
their stuff. I’m certainly going to

718
00:22:33.859 --> 00:22:35.151
their stuff. I’m certainly going to
be encouraging all my friends and

719
00:22:35.151 --> 00:22:37.859
be encouraging all my friends and
family to do that. Margaret? I

720
00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:42.109
family to do that. Margaret? I
completely agree. It is also

721
00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:44.526
completely agree. It is also
important that we have good

722
00:22:44.526 --> 00:22:47.943
important that we have good
communication. I know Matt and

723
00:22:47.943 --> 00:22:49.276
communication. I know Matt and
everybody because politics is aware

724
00:22:49.276 --> 00:22:49.609
everybody because politic is aware
of that.

725
00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:52.193
everybody because politics is aware
of that. There has to be trust

726
00:22:52.193 --> 00:22:53.443
of that. There has to be trust
invoices and people have to listen

727
00:22:53.443 --> 00:22:54.859
invoices and peopla have to listen
to

728
00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:57.109
invoices and people have to listen
to them and be able to trust them ——

729
00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:57.234
to them and be able to trust them --
tmsted

730
00:22:57.234 --> 00:22:59.984
to them and be able to trust them ——
trusted voices. And we have to learn

731
00:22:59.984 --> 00:23:00.359
tmsted voices. And we have to learn
from what

732
00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:00.776
trusted voices. And we have to learn
from what is happening

733
00:23:00.776 --> 00:23:02.734
from what is happening
internationally, even it if it is

734
00:23:02.734 --> 00:23:03.234
internationally, even it if it is
sometimes what

735
00:23:03.234 --> 00:23:03.401
internationally, even it if it is
sometimes whatnot

736
00:23:03.401 --> 00:23:04.318
internationally, even it if it is
sometimes what not to do. I’m going

737
00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:06.401
sometimes what not to do. I’m going
to take another name to question

738
00:23:06.401 --> 00:23:07.734
to take another name to question
here, but keep your hands up if

739
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:09.401
here, but keep your hands up if
there are things you want to say was

740
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:10.734
there are things you want to say was
that I know from all the questions

741
00:23:10.734 --> 00:23:12.109
that I know from all the questions
coming in when you are right that

742
00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:13.734
coming in when you are right that
there are a lot of things you want

743
00:23:13.734 --> 00:23:17.609
there are a lot of things you want
to ask. Let me go to Kishan Patel.

744
00:23:17.609 --> 00:23:19.484
to ask. Let me go to Kishan Patel.
How do you expect an already

745
00:23:19.484 --> 00:23:21.693
How do you expect an already
strained NHS to cope, given that one

746
00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:24.234
strained NHS to cope, given that one
in 12 NHS posts are vacant and

747
00:23:24.234 --> 00:23:25.484
in 12 NHS posts are vacant and
health care professionals would need

748
00:23:25.484 --> 00:23:25.818
health rare professionals would need
to

749
00:23:25.818 --> 00:23:26.901
health care professionals would need
to self—isolate for M days if

750
00:23:26.901 --> 00:23:27.234
to self-isolate for 14 days if
exposed to

751
00:23:27.234 --> 00:23:30.276
to self—isolate for M days if
exposed to the virus? Are you a

752
00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:30.484
exposed to the vims? Are you a
health

753
00:23:30.484 --> 00:23:32.068
exposed to the virus? Are you a
health care worker? Yes. What is

754
00:23:32.068 --> 00:23:32.651
health rare worker? Yes. what is
your view on

755
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:37.109
health care worker? Yes. What is
your view on this? I am worried

756
00:23:37.109 --> 00:23:39.901
your view on this? I am worried
because on the wards on a day—to—day

757
00:23:39.901 --> 00:23:40.484
because on the wards on a day-to-day
basis, we are

758
00:23:40.484 --> 00:23:43.484
because on the wards on a day—to—day
basis, we are already at breaching

759
00:23:43.484 --> 00:23:45.234
basis, we are already at breaching
point and I worry that an

760
00:23:45.234 --> 00:23:47.943
point and I worry that an
asymptomatic patient with the virus

761
00:23:47.943 --> 00:23:52.484
asymptomatic patient with the virus
infects the wards and we lose 50% or

762
00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:52.859
infects the wards and we lose 5096 or
even 2596

763
00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:56.276
infects the wards and we lose 50% or
even 25% of our workforce. And I

764
00:23:56.276 --> 00:23:56.693
even 2596 of our workforce. And I
can’t see

765
00:23:56.693 --> 00:23:57.901
even 25% of our workforce. And I
can’t see how we would be able to

766
00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:02.484
can’t see how we would be able to
deliver a safe service for patients.

767
00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:03.734
deliver a safe service for patients.
Xand, from your experience in the

768
00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:06.443
Xand, from your experience in the
health service? It is such an

769
00:24:06.443 --> 00:24:10.776
health service? It is such an
interesting question. My first

770
00:24:10.776 --> 00:24:12.943
interesting question. My first
instinct is to have a massive go at

771
00:24:12.943 --> 00:24:14.359
instinct is to have a massive go at
the Tory government and the last ten

772
00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:16.818
the Tory government and the last ten
years of austerity and the fact that

773
00:24:16.818 --> 00:24:18.943
years of austerity and the fact that
the NHS has been starved of cash and

774
00:24:18.943 --> 00:24:19.234
the NHS has been starved of rash and
starved

775
00:24:19.234 --> 00:24:20.234
the NHS has been starved of cash and
starved of staff and resources for

776
00:24:20.234 --> 00:24:25.401
starved of staff and resources for
so long.

777
00:24:27.443 --> 00:24:29.609
so long. In fact, I think this
represents such a significant burden

778
00:24:29.609 --> 00:24:33.984
represents such a significant burden
that no matter what health service a

779
00:24:33.984 --> 00:24:35.943
that no matter what health service a
country has, the threat of pandemic

780
00:24:35.943 --> 00:24:39.234
country has, the threat of pandemic
disease will always produce disease

781
00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:40.318
disease will always produce disease
that will overwhelm a normally

782
00:24:40.318 --> 00:24:43.401
that will overwhelm a normally
functioning health service. So

783
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:46.234
functioning health service. So
although I share all your concerns

784
00:24:46.234 --> 00:24:51.401
although I share all your concerns
about the NHS and the state of it at

785
00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:52.609
about the NHS and the state of it at
the moment, our ability to provide

786
00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:54.359
the moment, our ability to provide
the level of intensive care beds,

787
00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:54.901
the level of intensive rare beds,
which is

788
00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:55.901
the level of intensive care beds,
which is the main issue because we

789
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:57.901
which is the main issue because we
don’t have a cure for coronavirus,

790
00:24:57.901 --> 00:24:58.609
don’t have a cure for coronavims,
so if you come

791
00:24:58.609 --> 00:24:59.859
don’t have a cure for coronavirus,
so if you come into hospital and you

792
00:24:59.859 --> 00:25:00.068
so if you come into hospital and you
are

793
00:25:00.068 --> 00:25:00.193
so if you come into hospital and you
arejust

794
00:25:00.193 --> 00:25:00.443
so if you come into hospital and you
are just poorty,

795
00:25:00.443 --> 00:25:01.359
so if you come into hospital and you
are just poorly, you will not be

796
00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:01.526
are just poorty, you will not be
achieving

797
00:25:01.526 --> 00:25:02.359
are just poorly, you will not be
achieving anything more than you

798
00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:06.068
achieving anything more than you
could at home. So the majority of

799
00:25:06.068 --> 00:25:06.443
could at home. So the majority of
peopla stay

800
00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:08.109
could at home. So the majority of
people stay at home, get a box set,

801
00:25:08.109 --> 00:25:09.776
people stay at home, get a box set,
have some lemon and honey and

802
00:25:09.776 --> 00:25:11.276
have some lemon and honey and
convalesce. If you are deteriorating

803
00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:11.443
convalasce. If you are deteriorating
and

804
00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:11.984
comalasce. If you are deteriorating
and you go into

805
00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:12.484
convalesce. If you are deteriorating
and you go into hospital, the

806
00:25:12.484 --> 00:25:14.901
and you go into hospital, the
decision is whether you need

807
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:15.693
decision is whether you need
intensive care, things like

808
00:25:15.693 --> 00:25:17.109
intensive care, things like
ventilation. That is where among the

809
00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:17.401
ventilation. That is where among the
51:

810
00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:18.901
ventilation. That is where among the
596 who

811
00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:19.776
ventilation. That is where among the
5% who need that urgent extreme

812
00:25:19.776 --> 00:25:20.443
596 who need that urgent extreme
rare, that is

813
00:25:20.443 --> 00:25:24.151
5% who need that urgent extreme
care, that is where lives are saved.

814
00:25:24.151 --> 00:25:24.776
rare, that is where lives are saved.
Those

815
00:25:24.776 --> 00:25:26.276
care, that is where lives are saved.
Those beds in a major crisis like

816
00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:26.818
Those beds in a major crisis like
this are not

817
00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:28.693
Those beds in a major crisis like
this are notjust going to be

818
00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:28.901
Those beds in a major crisis like
this are notjust going to beJohn

819
00:25:28.901 --> 00:25:29.276
this are not just going to be john
from the

820
00:25:29.276 --> 00:25:30.109
this are notjust going to beJohn
from the normal pool of intensive

821
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.526
from the normal pool of intensive
rare

822
00:25:31.526 --> 00:25:33.484
from the normal pool of intensive
care beds. Matt will know much more

823
00:25:33.484 --> 00:25:34.068
rare beds. Matt will know much more
about this

824
00:25:34.068 --> 00:25:36.109
care beds. Matt will know much more
about this than me, but they will be

825
00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:37.276
about this than me, but they will be
drawn from the major incident plan

826
00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:41.359
drawn from the major incident plan
is on the big catastrophe plans. 50

827
00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:41.859
is on the big catastrophe plans. So
although I

828
00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:42.484
is on the big catastrophe plans. 50
although I share your concerns

829
00:25:42.484 --> 00:25:42.651
is on the big catastrophe plans. So
although I share your concerns about

830
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:45.901
although I share your concerns about
the future of the NHS, in this

831
00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:47.276
the future of the NHS, in this
particular case I think the

832
00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:48.109
particular case I think the
immediate resources come from

833
00:25:48.109 --> 00:25:54.484
immediate resources come from
elsewhere. I think that is

834
00:25:54.484 --> 00:25:55.484
elsewhere. I think that is
reasonable. We acknowledge that we

835
00:25:55.484 --> 00:25:56.818
reasonable. We acknowledge that we
need more people in the NHS. There

836
00:25:56.818 --> 00:25:58.484
need more people in the NHS. There
was a record number of people

837
00:25:58.484 --> 00:25:59.401
was a record number of peopla
currently

838
00:25:59.401 --> 00:26:01.818
was a record number of people
currently working today in the NHS

839
00:26:01.818 --> 00:26:03.609
currently working today in the NHS
and I’m pleased to see those numbers

840
00:26:03.609 --> 00:26:09.484
and I’m pleased to see those numbers
been going up recently. But Xand is

841
00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:11.026
been going up recently. But Xand is
right that the challenge in the NHS

842
00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:13.859
right that the challenge in the NHS
at the moment is that demand has

843
00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:17.359
at the moment is that demand has
been going up. And something like

844
00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:20.734
been going up. And something like
this will add to that. But I would

845
00:26:20.734 --> 00:26:24.443
this will add to that. But I would
say this as well. The NHS is

846
00:26:24.443 --> 00:26:26.943
say this as well. The NHS is
unbelievably good at responding to

847
00:26:26.943 --> 00:26:30.193
unbelievably good at responding to
crises. They do it in a small way

848
00:26:30.193 --> 00:26:32.526
crises. They do it in a small way
every day in all of the A&Es across

849
00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:35.401
every day in all of the Aan across
the country. It

850
00:26:35.401 --> 00:26:37.234
every day in all of the A&Es across
the country. It may have to

851
00:26:37.234 --> 00:26:40.693
the country. It may have to
reconfigure in some ways if this

852
00:26:40.693 --> 00:26:43.734
reconfigure in some ways if this
does become a pandemic. That has to

853
00:26:43.734 --> 00:26:44.401
does become a pandemic. That has to
be clinically lad

854
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:45.026
does become a pandemic. That has to
be clinically led so that the

855
00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:46.484
be clinically led so that the
doctors can decide what is the best

856
00:26:46.484 --> 00:26:46.568
doctors ran decide what is the best
“Y

857
00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:48.151
doctors ran decide what is the best
way to save

858
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:52.109
doctors can decide what is the best
way to save lives, and I will give

859
00:26:52.109 --> 00:26:54.859
way to save lives, and I will give
them the freedom to make the right

860
00:26:54.859 --> 00:26:56.026
them the freedom to make the right
decisions and we are also making

861
00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:58.193
decisions and we are also making
money available if they need it. But

862
00:26:58.193 --> 00:27:00.401
money available if they need it. But
it is less about the money and more

863
00:27:00.401 --> 00:27:00.901
it is lass about the money and more
about how you

864
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:01.818
it is less about the money and more
about how you use the resources of

865
00:27:01.818 --> 00:27:04.234
about how you use the resources of
the nation best to support people to

866
00:27:04.234 --> 00:27:06.484
the nation best to support people to
get through what will be a

867
00:27:06.484 --> 00:27:07.484
get through what will be a
challenging period. Lots of hands

868
00:27:07.484 --> 00:27:08.026
challanging period. Lots of hands
are up. The

869
00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:12.526
challenging period. Lots of hands
are up. The woman in the blue top? I

870
00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:14.651
are up. The woman in the blue top? I
don’t think enough is being done to

871
00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:17.026
don’t think enough is being done to
prevent the disease coming into the

872
00:27:17.026 --> 00:27:17.651
prevent the disease coming into the
country. when

873
00:27:17.651 --> 00:27:18.651
prevent the disease coming into the
country. When you travel to Asia or

874
00:27:18.651 --> 00:27:18.859
country. when you travel to Asia or
the

875
00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:20.609
country. When you travel to Asia or
the Middle East at the moment, you

876
00:27:20.609 --> 00:27:24.109
the Middle East at the moment, you
are met at airports with your

877
00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:25.109
are met at airports with your
temperature taken and your symptoms

878
00:27:25.109 --> 00:27:28.068
temperature taken and your symptoms
being monitored and then if you have

879
00:27:28.068 --> 00:27:32.609
being monitored and then if you have
symptoms, I don’t know exactly what

880
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:35.068
symptoms, I don’t know exactly what
happens but the case would have been

881
00:27:35.068 --> 00:27:35.443
happens but the use would have been
recorded.

882
00:27:35.443 --> 00:27:36.443
happens but the case would have been
recorded. In this country, you

883
00:27:36.443 --> 00:27:38.734
recorded. In this country, you
arrive at Heathrow or Gatwick,

884
00:27:38.734 --> 00:27:40.151
arrive at Heathrow or Gatwick,
nothing is done. You might be given

885
00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:42.818
nothing is done. You might be given
a piece of paper saying call 111.

886
00:27:42.818 --> 00:27:43.818
a piece of paper saying (211111.
You get in a

887
00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:45.443
a piece of paper saying call111.
You get in a taxi and go to a hotel.

888
00:27:45.443 --> 00:27:47.318
You get in a taxi and go to a hotel.
There is no hand sanitiser anywhere.

889
00:27:47.318 --> 00:27:49.693
There is no hand sanitiser anywhere.
In Asia and other parts of the

890
00:27:49.693 --> 00:27:51.484
In Asia and other parts of the
world, they are all over the place.

891
00:27:51.484 --> 00:27:53.276
world, they are all over the place.
So it seems that anyone coming to

892
00:27:53.276 --> 00:27:55.359
So it seems that anyone coming to
this country, nothing is done at the

893
00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:57.859
this country, nothing is done at the
airport, so it is going to spread

894
00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:00.109
airport, so it is going to spread
because there is no prevention. Let

895
00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:01.651
because there is no prevention. Let
me take a few other points. The

896
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:06.318
me take a few other points. The
woman there? This presumably could

897
00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:09.359
woman there? This presumably could
be our new normal with climate

898
00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:09.901
be our new normal with climate
change. with

899
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:11.859
be our new normal with climate
change. With increasing

900
00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:15.651
change. With increasing
temperatures, new pathogens, this

901
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:18.901
temperatures, new pathogens, this
has been predicted for a long time.

902
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:20.443
has been predicted for a long time.
At the same time, we are saying we

903
00:28:20.443 --> 00:28:22.901
At the same time, we are saying we
are all mobilising when actually,

904
00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:25.609
are all mobilising when actually,
there is a lot of cross—party

905
00:28:25.609 --> 00:28:25.901
there is a lot of cross-party
proactive

906
00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:26.859
there is a lot of cross—party
proactive action. What can we learn

907
00:28:26.859 --> 00:28:27.318
proactive action. what ran we learn
from this

908
00:28:27.318 --> 00:28:29.026
proactive action. What can we learn
from this that we could apply to the

909
00:28:29.026 --> 00:28:29.984
from this that we could apply to the
larger existential problem that is

910
00:28:29.984 --> 00:28:33.068
larger existential problem that is
climate change? The man in the dark

911
00:28:33.068 --> 00:28:38.443
climate change? The man in the dark
blue shirt? Social

912
00:28:38.443 --> 00:28:38.526
climate change? The man in the dark
blue shirt? Socialfactors

913
00:28:38.526 --> 00:28:39.068
climate change? The man in the dark
blue shirt? Social factors are also

914
00:28:39.068 --> 00:28:40.318
blue shirt? Social factors are also
important. Since the outbreak I have

915
00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:44.818
important. Since the outbreak I have
seen a spike in races on social

916
00:28:44.818 --> 00:28:48.401
seen a spike in races on social
media. On public transport my fence

917
00:28:48.401 --> 00:28:49.443
media. On public transport my fence
have been ——

918
00:28:49.443 --> 00:28:49.651
media. On public transport my fence
have been -- my

919
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.276
media. On public transport my fence
have been —— my friends have been

920
00:28:50.276 --> 00:28:50.818
have been -- my friends have been
targeted and I

921
00:28:50.818 --> 00:28:52.193
have been —— my friends have been
targeted and I was an attack on an

922
00:28:52.193 --> 00:28:53.318
targeted and I was an attack on an
Asian man. What is the government

923
00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:53.943
Asian man. what is the government
doing to stop

924
00:28:53.943 --> 00:28:56.026
Asian man. What is the government
doing to stop this racist rhetoric,

925
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:59.484
doing to stop this racist rhetoric,
this is the same government that

926
00:28:59.484 --> 00:29:01.026
this is the same government that
failed with the Brexit hate from the

927
00:29:01.026 --> 00:29:02.484
failed with the Brexit hate from the
media. What are you going to do

928
00:29:02.484 --> 00:29:02.693
media. what are you going to do
about

929
00:29:02.693 --> 00:29:06.026
media. What are you going to do
about that? And the man in the

930
00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:08.568
about that? And the man in the
glasses? I think we as a community

931
00:29:08.568 --> 00:29:09.859
glasses? I think we as a community
ran play a big

932
00:29:09.859 --> 00:29:11.109
glasses? I think we as a community
can play a big part. It is not

933
00:29:11.109 --> 00:29:11.276
glasses? I think we as a community
can play a big part. It is notjust

934
00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:11.568
ran play a big part. It is not just
down to

935
00:29:11.568 --> 00:29:12.901
can play a big part. It is notjust
down to the NHS and the health

936
00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:14.443
down to the NHS and the health
professionals. We should be looking

937
00:29:14.443 --> 00:29:18.901
professionals. We should be looking
out for our neighbours, elderly and

938
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:21.276
out for our neighbours, elderly and
vulnerable people that we know. We

939
00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:24.859
vulnerable people that we know. We
should help them out as best we can.

940
00:29:24.859 --> 00:29:25.901
should help them out as best we ran.
Let me get

941
00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:27.359
should help them out as best we can.
Let me get around the rest of the

942
00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:31.443
Let me get around the rest of the
panel. Tim? On the point about the

943
00:29:31.443 --> 00:29:31.818
panel. Tim? On the point about the
NHS, I

944
00:29:31.818 --> 00:29:31.943
panel. Tim? On the point about the
NHS, Iagree

945
00:29:31.943 --> 00:29:34.484
panel. Tim? On the point about the
NHS, I agree with all the points are

946
00:29:34.484 --> 00:29:35.193
NHS, I agree with all the points are
being made, but

947
00:29:35.193 --> 00:29:35.401
NHS, I agree with all the points are
being made, butl

948
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:36.193
NHS, I agree with all the points are
being made, but I want to pick on

949
00:29:36.193 --> 00:29:38.443
being made, but I want to pick on
what Margaret said about how this

950
00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.193
what Margaret said about how this
crisis is probably going to expose

951
00:29:40.193 --> 00:29:41.276
crisis is probably going to expose
weaknesses that already exist. In

952
00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:41.818
weaknesses that already exist. In
the rase

953
00:29:41.818 --> 00:29:45.401
weaknesses that already exist. In
the case of the NHS, readers of my

954
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:45.776
the rase of the NHS, readers of my
newspaper the

955
00:29:45.776 --> 00:29:46.276
the case of the NHS, readers of my
newspaper the Telegraph report

956
00:29:46.276 --> 00:29:49.068
newspaper the Telegraph report
difficulties getting through on the

957
00:29:49.068 --> 00:29:50.109
difficulties getting through on the
111 number, difficulties getting a

958
00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:50.276
111 number, difficulties getting a
all

959
00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:50.943
111 number, difficulties getting a
call back. There’s the

960
00:29:50.943 --> 00:29:51.651
111 number, difficulties getting a
callback. There’s the question of

961
00:29:51.651 --> 00:29:52.401
all back. There’s the question of
whether

962
00:29:52.401 --> 00:29:53.484
callback. There’s the question of
whether GPs will be doing visits,

963
00:29:53.484 --> 00:29:55.484
whether GPs will be doing visits,
because they have stopped doing home

964
00:29:55.484 --> 00:29:57.484
because they have stopped doing home
visits in many parts of the country

965
00:29:57.484 --> 00:29:59.443
visits in many parts of the country
for a long time. A&E is already

966
00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:00.901
for a long time. A&E is already
overcrowded. Then you have the

967
00:30:00.901 --> 00:30:02.109
overcrowded. Then you have the
problem of people being in hospital

968
00:30:02.109 --> 00:30:02.818
problem of peopla being in hospital
is at

969
00:30:02.818 --> 00:30:03.901
problem of people being in hospital
is at the moment who shouldn’t be.

970
00:30:03.901 --> 00:30:06.109
is at the moment who shouldn’t be.
They should be in social care. It is

971
00:30:06.109 --> 00:30:07.484
They should be in social rare. It is
not just an NHS

972
00:30:07.484 --> 00:30:08.276
They should be in social care. It is
notjust an NHS problem, it is also

973
00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:08.609
not just an NHS problam, it is also
a social

974
00:30:08.609 --> 00:30:10.484
notjust an NHS problem, it is also
a social care problem. And listening

975
00:30:10.484 --> 00:30:11.484
a social rare problem. And listening
to the

976
00:30:11.484 --> 00:30:12.484
a social care problem. And listening
to the agreement on the panel is

977
00:30:12.484 --> 00:30:15.068
to the agreement on the panel is
fantastic, but as the lady in the

978
00:30:15.068 --> 00:30:15.984
fantastic, but as the lady in the
audience suggested, I am intrigued

979
00:30:15.984 --> 00:30:18.318
audience suggested, I am intrigued
as to why we don’t see more of this.

980
00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:20.193
as to why we don’t see more of this.
Surely there are some problems in

981
00:30:20.193 --> 00:30:21.484
Surely there are some problems in
our society which are indeed

982
00:30:21.484 --> 00:30:22.818
our society which are indeed
nonpartisan and it would be nice to

983
00:30:22.818 --> 00:30:25.359
nonpartisan and it would be nice to
hear this kind of tone and this kind

984
00:30:25.359 --> 00:30:27.443
hear this kind of tone and this kind
of working together. If only we

985
00:30:27.443 --> 00:30:28.901
of working together. If only we
could have displayed spirit when it

986
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:29.151
could have displayed spirit when it
fame

987
00:30:29.151 --> 00:30:30.109
could have displayed spirit when it
came to the environment or our

988
00:30:30.109 --> 00:30:30.318
fame to the environment or our
schools

989
00:30:30.318 --> 00:30:32.609
came to the environment or our
schools and hospitals —— if only we

990
00:30:32.609 --> 00:30:33.068
schools and hospitals -- if only we
could have

991
00:30:33.068 --> 00:30:36.693
schools and hospitals —— if only we
could have this blitz spirit.

992
00:30:36.693 --> 00:30:38.734
could have this blitz spirit.
Margaret, let me take you back to

993
00:30:38.734 --> 00:30:40.443
Margaret, let me take you back to
the original question, how do you

994
00:30:40.443 --> 00:30:42.484
the original question, how do you
expect an already strained NHS to

995
00:30:42.484 --> 00:30:45.068
expect an already strained NHS to
cope, given that one in 12 NHS posts

996
00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:46.151
cope, given that one in 12 NHS posts
are vacant and health care

997
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:47.193
are vacant and health care
professionals would need to

998
00:30:47.193 --> 00:30:48.193
professionals would need to
self—isolate for a fortnight if

999
00:30:48.193 --> 00:30:48.984
self-isolate for a fortnight if
exposed?

1000
00:30:48.984 --> 00:30:52.484
self—isolate for a fortnight if
exposed? One of the other things is

1001
00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:54.151
exposed? One of the other things is
that this is going to make us look

1002
00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:55.359
that this is going to make us look
at other things, not

1003
00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:56.151
that this is going to make us look
at other things, notjust the health

1004
00:30:56.151 --> 00:30:56.359
at other things, not just the health
service,

1005
00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:57.693
at other things, notjust the health
service, which most of us think of

1006
00:30:57.693 --> 00:31:00.693
service, which most of us think of
as hospitals and GPs. But it was

1007
00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:03.359
as hospitals and GPs. But it was
raised in the House yesterday in the

1008
00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:05.901
raised in the House yesterday in the
same, constructive tone, but we

1009
00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:07.026
same, constructive tone, but we
don’t yet know what the public

1010
00:31:07.026 --> 00:31:09.151
don’t yet know what the public
health budget is or if there is

1011
00:31:09.151 --> 00:31:11.693
health budget is or if there is
going to be much of an improvement

1012
00:31:11.693 --> 00:31:14.484
going to be much of an improvement
in the public health budget. Local

1013
00:31:14.484 --> 00:31:16.109
in the public health budget. Local
authorities, particularly if this

1014
00:31:16.109 --> 00:31:16.443
authorities, particularty if this
gets worse,

1015
00:31:16.443 --> 00:31:19.026
authorities, particularly if this
gets worse, will be asked to play a

1016
00:31:19.026 --> 00:31:20.734
gets worse, will be asked to play a
heroic role. They already have great

1017
00:31:20.734 --> 00:31:21.526
heroic role. They already have great
responsibilities for social care

1018
00:31:21.526 --> 00:31:21.859
responsibilities for social rare
which they

1019
00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:24.651
responsibilities for social care
which they are struggling to fulfil.

1020
00:31:24.651 --> 00:31:25.026
which they are stmggling to fulfil.
So one

1021
00:31:25.026 --> 00:31:26.318
which they are struggling to fulfil.
So one of the things that ought to

1022
00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:29.401
So one of the things that ought to
come out of all of this is for us to

1023
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:31.901
come out of all of this is for us to
recognise a

1024
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:32.401
come out of all of this is for us to
recognise afresh

1025
00:31:32.401 --> 00:31:33.318
come out of all of this is for us to
recognise a fresh the need for

1026
00:31:33.318 --> 00:31:33.484
recognise a fresh the need for
long-term

1027
00:31:33.484 --> 00:31:34.276
recognise a fresh the need for
long—term sustained investment. That

1028
00:31:34.276 --> 00:31:35.068
long-term sustained investment. That
goes back to the

1029
00:31:35.068 --> 00:31:35.651
long—term sustained investment. That
goes back to the point the lady

1030
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:37.734
goes back to the point the lady
raised about climate change. The

1031
00:31:37.734 --> 00:31:41.318
raised about climate change. The
answer to all of this is to have

1032
00:31:41.318 --> 00:31:41.484
answer to all of this is to have
Proper.

1033
00:31:41.484 --> 00:31:42.068
answer to all of this is to have
proper, long—term planning, whether

1034
00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:42.984
proper, long-term planning, whether
it is for

1035
00:31:42.984 --> 00:31:48.318
proper, long—term planning, whether
it is for floods or feeders.

1036
00:31:48.484 --> 00:31:48.693
it is for floods or feeders. ——

1037
00:31:48.693 --> 00:31:49.568
it is for ﬂoods or feeders. --
fevers. We

1038
00:31:49.568 --> 00:31:51.026
it is for floods or feeders. ——
fevers. We have to recognise the

1039
00:31:51.026 --> 00:31:52.234
fevers. We have to recognise the
challenges of our world and prepare

1040
00:31:52.234 --> 00:31:52.484
challanges of our world and prepare
for

1041
00:31:52.484 --> 00:31:53.484
challenges of our world and prepare
for them on a consistent and

1042
00:31:53.484 --> 00:31:56.068
for them on a consistent and
thorough basis, taking in all the

1043
00:31:56.068 --> 00:31:59.484
thorough basis, taking in all the
scientific advice along the way.

1044
00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:03.568
scientific advice along the way.
Layla? |

1045
00:32:03.568 --> 00:32:05.568
scientific advice along the way.
Layla? I completely agree with what

1046
00:32:05.568 --> 00:32:05.859
layla? I completely agree with what
Margaret has

1047
00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:06.693
Layla? I completely agree with what
Margaret has said. With Tim’s point

1048
00:32:06.693 --> 00:32:06.984
Margaret has said. with Tim’s point
about

1049
00:32:06.984 --> 00:32:10.651
Margaret has said. With Tim’s point
about adult social care, there is a

1050
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:11.609
about adult social rare, there is a
lot of goodwill

1051
00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:12.484
about adult social care, there is a
lot of goodwill in the House and

1052
00:32:12.484 --> 00:32:15.401
lot of goodwill in the House and
across parties to work on this. But

1053
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:17.693
across parties to work on this. But
it is a Conservative majority

1054
00:32:17.693 --> 00:32:19.276
it is a Conservative majority
government with a big majority.

1055
00:32:19.276 --> 00:32:20.484
government with a big majority.
During the election, I remember

1056
00:32:20.484 --> 00:32:20.651
During the election, I remember
Boris

1057
00:32:20.651 --> 00:32:21.318
During the election, I remember
BorisJohnson saying that

1058
00:32:21.318 --> 00:32:21.526
During the election, I remember
Boris Johnson saying that within

1059
00:32:21.526 --> 00:32:21.734
During the election, I remember
BorisJohnson saying that within the

1060
00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:23.109
Boris johnson saying that within the
first

1061
00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:24.443
BorisJohnson saying that within the
first 100 days, he would convene a

1062
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.068
first 100 days, he would convene a
cross-party

1063
00:32:26.068 --> 00:32:26.859
first 100 days, he would convene a
cross—party commission to look at

1064
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:27.109
cross-party commission to look at
this

1065
00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:29.693
cross—party commission to look at
this intractable problem and to help

1066
00:32:29.693 --> 00:32:33.443
this intractable problem and to help
us find a solution. It is day 84

1067
00:32:33.443 --> 00:32:35.068
us find a solution. It is day 84
today and we still haven’t seen

1068
00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:35.651
today and we still haven’t seen
that, so

1069
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:35.818
today and we still haven’t seen
that, sol

1070
00:32:35.818 --> 00:32:37.359
today and we still haven’t seen
that, so I guess my plea would be to

1071
00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:38.568
that, so I guess my plea would be to
the government, you need to show

1072
00:32:38.568 --> 00:32:41.859
the government, you need to show
some leadership. That is how

1073
00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:44.276
some leadership. That is how
governments work. The government ‘s

1074
00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:45.484
governments work. The government ‘s
use this stuff and then parliament

1075
00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:45.901
use this stuff and then partiament
will engage

1076
00:32:45.901 --> 00:32:46.609
use this stuff and then parliament
will engage with it. But the

1077
00:32:46.609 --> 00:32:50.859
will engage with it. But the
government has to initiate it. I

1078
00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:52.484
government has to initiate it. I
hope we will get on and solve some

1079
00:32:52.484 --> 00:32:53.818
hope we will get on and solve some
of these big issues, because it

1080
00:32:53.818 --> 00:32:55.859
of these big issues, because it
can’t wait any longer. But, do you

1081
00:32:55.859 --> 00:32:57.693
can’t wait any longer. But, do you
want to answer some of the questions

1082
00:32:57.693 --> 00:33:00.068
want to answer some of the questions
put by members of the audience? The

1083
00:33:00.068 --> 00:33:01.109
put by members of the audience? The
lady talking about people coming

1084
00:33:01.109 --> 00:33:01.234
lady talking about peopla coming
into

1085
00:33:01.234 --> 00:33:04.776
lady talking about people coming
into the country, for example. Yes,

1086
00:33:04.776 --> 00:33:06.526
into the country, for example. Yes,
I will answer as many as I can. I

1087
00:33:06.526 --> 00:33:07.276
I will answer as many as I ran. I
agree on a point

1088
00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:09.193
I will answer as many as I can. I
agree on a point in social care and

1089
00:33:09.193 --> 00:33:09.526
agree on a point in social rare and
we will

1090
00:33:09.526 --> 00:33:10.234
agree on a point in social care and
we will fulfil that manifesto

1091
00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:12.484
we will fulfil that manifesto
commitment. The point about people

1092
00:33:12.484 --> 00:33:13.484
commitment. The point about peopla
coming into the

1093
00:33:13.484 --> 00:33:14.401
commitment. The point about people
coming into the country, I have been

1094
00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:18.901
coming into the country, I have been
asked about this a lot. The thing is

1095
00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:20.068
asked about this a lot. The thing is
that if this virus becomes

1096
00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:22.359
that if this virus becomes
established around the world, then

1097
00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:23.651
established around the world, then
there is no way of stopping it

1098
00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:28.901
there is no way of stopping it
getting to Britain eventually. So

1099
00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:32.068
getting to Britain eventually. So
the decision was, do you try to shut

1100
00:33:32.068 --> 00:33:34.609
the decision was, do you try to shut
ourselves off as a nation and delay

1101
00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:36.276
ourselves off as a nation and delay
it, and if it does go pandemic in

1102
00:33:36.276 --> 00:33:38.484
it, and if it does go pandemic in
the rest of the world, it is

1103
00:33:38.484 --> 00:33:42.234
the rest of the world, it is
inevitable that it would come here?

1104
00:33:42.234 --> 00:33:42.484
inevitable that it would come here?
Or

1105
00:33:42.484 --> 00:33:42.693
inevitable that it would come here?
0rdo

1106
00:33:42.693 --> 00:33:44.109
inevitable that it would come here?
Or do you try to keep as much normal

1107
00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:45.609
Or do you try to keep as much normal
life as possibla

1108
00:33:45.609 --> 00:33:47.068
Or do you try to keep as much normal
life as possible and tackle it by

1109
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:47.276
life as possibla and tackla it by
finding

1110
00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:49.068
life as possible and tackle it by
finding those who do come into the

1111
00:33:49.068 --> 00:33:51.901
finding those who do come into the
country and are then symptomatic? So

1112
00:33:51.901 --> 00:33:53.484
country and are then symptomatic? So
you rightly got a leaflet saying

1113
00:33:53.484 --> 00:33:53.568
you rightly got a leaﬂet saying
that

1114
00:33:53.568 --> 00:33:53.984
you rightly got a leaflet saying
that if

1115
00:33:53.984 --> 00:33:54.234
you rightly got a leaﬂet saying
that if you

1116
00:33:54.234 --> 00:33:55.151
you rightly got a leaflet saying
that if you had a symptom, you

1117
00:33:55.151 --> 00:33:57.984
that if you had a symptom, you
should call 111 and if you had a

1118
00:33:57.984 --> 00:33:58.693
should (211111 and if you had a
symptom, no

1119
00:33:58.693 --> 00:34:00.318
should call 111 and if you had a
symptom, no doubt you would have

1120
00:34:00.318 --> 00:34:00.443
symptom, no doubt you would have
rallad

1121
00:34:00.443 --> 00:34:02.109
symptom, no doubt you would have
called 111. Lots of people did and

1122
00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:02.443
rallad 111. Lots of peopla did and
that was

1123
00:34:02.443 --> 00:34:03.693
called 111. Lots of people did and
that was how we found many of the

1124
00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:07.484
that was how we found many of the
cases. There was one country in

1125
00:34:07.484 --> 00:34:08.693
cases. There was one country in
Europe that chose to stop the

1126
00:34:08.693 --> 00:34:09.109
Europe that chose to stop the
ﬂights, and

1127
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:12.693
Europe that chose to stop the
flights, and that was Italy. And

1128
00:34:12.693 --> 00:34:12.859
ﬂights, and that was Italy. And
they

1129
00:34:12.859 --> 00:34:15.068
flights, and that was Italy. And
they became the European epicentre

1130
00:34:15.068 --> 00:34:20.109
they became the European epicentre
of this epidemic. In a way, that

1131
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:21.943
of this epidemic. In a way, that
really demonstrated to me how we

1132
00:34:21.943 --> 00:34:24.068
really demonstrated to me how we
must follow the science. Of course

1133
00:34:24.068 --> 00:34:30.234
must follow the science. Of course
there are pressures on me to do

1134
00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:31.443
there are pressures on me to do
things which people feel intuitively

1135
00:34:31.443 --> 00:34:31.818
things which peopla feel intuitively
that they

1136
00:34:31.818 --> 00:34:32.859
things which people feel intuitively
that they are right and I understand

1137
00:34:32.859 --> 00:34:34.401
that they are right and I understand
where you are coming from on this.

1138
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:36.359
where you are coming from on this.
But we have to follow the science

1139
00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:39.109
But we have to follow the science
and the epidemiology, and our Chief

1140
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:40.276
and the epidemiology, and our Chief
Medical Officer, 3 shout out to

1141
00:34:40.276 --> 00:34:41.151
Medical Officer, a shout out to
Chris

1142
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:43.526
Medical Officer, 3 shout out to
Chris Whitty, brilliant scientist.

1143
00:34:43.526 --> 00:34:43.943
Chris whitty, brilliant scientist.
He is

1144
00:34:43.943 --> 00:34:46.776
Chris Whitty, brilliant scientist.
He is the voice of calm reason. He

1145
00:34:46.776 --> 00:34:48.318
He is the voice of calm reason. He
is one of the most experienced

1146
00:34:48.318 --> 00:34:49.443
is one of the most experienced
epidemiologists in the world and he

1147
00:34:49.443 --> 00:34:52.818
epidemiologists in the world and he
said to me, if we stop the flights,

1148
00:34:52.818 --> 00:34:53.193
said to me, if we stop the ﬂights,
with all

1149
00:34:53.193 --> 00:34:56.234
said to me, if we stop the flights,
with all the consequences that

1150
00:34:56.234 --> 00:34:58.068
with all the consequences that
brings, it would only delay the

1151
00:34:58.068 --> 00:34:59.484
brings, it would only delay the
arrival of this disease here by a

1152
00:34:59.484 --> 00:35:01.109
arrival of this disease here by a
matter of days, but it would also

1153
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:04.693
matter of days, but it would also
make it harder for us to get

1154
00:35:04.693 --> 00:35:06.401
make it harder for us to get
medicines into this country that we

1155
00:35:06.401 --> 00:35:07.609
medicines into this country that we
need, because many of them are

1156
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:10.651
need, because many of them are
produced abroad. What about ticking

1157
00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:10.901
produced abroad. what about ticking
people’s

1158
00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:11.526
produced abroad. What about ticking
people’s temperatures at the

1159
00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:15.026
people’s temperatures at the
airport? Checking the temperature

1160
00:35:15.026 --> 00:35:16.609
airport? Checking the temperature
doesn’t have an effect. The reason

1161
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:18.026
doesn’t have an effect. The reason
is that you get lots of false

1162
00:35:18.026 --> 00:35:20.068
is that you get lots of false
positives. You get lots of people

1163
00:35:20.068 --> 00:35:20.276
positives. You get lots of peopla
who

1164
00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:21.818
positives. You get lots of people
who have a temperature and it is not

1165
00:35:21.818 --> 00:35:22.193
who have a temperature and it is not
for coronavims,

1166
00:35:22.193 --> 00:35:23.068
who have a temperature and it is not
for coronavirus, so you end up

1167
00:35:23.068 --> 00:35:23.234
for coronavims, so you end up
spending

1168
00:35:23.234 --> 00:35:24.776
for coronavirus, so you end up
spending huge amount of resources

1169
00:35:24.776 --> 00:35:27.109
spending huge amount of resources
and not spotting the people. The

1170
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:29.193
and not spotting the people. The
Americans tried checking

1171
00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:31.776
Americans tried checking
temperatures. It may have reassured

1172
00:35:31.776 --> 00:35:32.776
temperatures. It may have reassured
peopla. It has

1173
00:35:32.776 --> 00:35:33.776
temperatures. It may have reassured
people. It has had no impact on the

1174
00:35:33.776 --> 00:35:34.193
peopla. It has had no impact on the
spread of

1175
00:35:34.193 --> 00:35:36.068
people. It has had no impact on the
spread of the virus there, and the

1176
00:35:36.068 --> 00:35:39.859
spread of the virus there, and the
Italians also did it. So I hear

1177
00:35:39.859 --> 00:35:40.068
spread of the virus there, and the
Italians also did it. Sol hear all

1178
00:35:40.068 --> 00:35:40.484
Italians also did it. So I hear all
these things

1179
00:35:40.484 --> 00:35:41.318
Italians also did it. Sol hear all
these things and I instinctively

1180
00:35:41.318 --> 00:35:43.026
these things and I instinctively
agree with many of them. It is a bit

1181
00:35:43.026 --> 00:35:44.859
agree with many of them. It is a bit
like the point about the mass

1182
00:35:44.859 --> 00:35:46.484
like the point about the mass
gatherings. I understand why it

1183
00:35:46.484 --> 00:35:47.734
gatherings. I understand why it
seems intuitive that that is the

1184
00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:50.859
seems intuitive that that is the
right thing to do, but the judgment

1185
00:35:50.859 --> 00:35:52.609
right thing to do, but the judgment
that I made with the prime minister

1186
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:54.401
that I made with the prime minister
at the start of this is that we are

1187
00:35:54.401 --> 00:35:57.109
at the start of this is that we are
going to listen very hard to the

1188
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:58.401
going to listen very hard to the
scientists. We are going to think

1189
00:35:58.401 --> 00:36:00.443
scientists. We are going to think
through this problem as a country

1190
00:36:00.443 --> 00:36:03.234
through this problem as a country
and they are going to try to have

1191
00:36:03.234 --> 00:36:04.693
and they are going to try to have
the best possible response despite

1192
00:36:04.693 --> 00:36:07.693
the best possible response despite
the pressures, and then it is

1193
00:36:07.693 --> 00:36:09.651
the pressures, and then it is
incumbent on us to explain why we

1194
00:36:09.651 --> 00:36:13.484
incumbent on us to explain why we
are taking the approach that we are.

1195
00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:15.068
get the food and supplies that they
need.

1196
00:36:15.068 --> 00:36:20.401
Before we carry on, I want to tell
you next week is budget week. Next

1197
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:22.484
you next week is budget week. Next
week in West Bromwich and the

1198
00:36:22.484 --> 00:36:23.484
week in West Bromwich and the
following week in Weston—super—Mare.

1199
00:36:23.484 --> 00:36:24.651
following week in Weston-super-Mare.
If you want to

following week in Weston—super—Mare.
If you want to be in the audience

1201
00:36:25.484 --> 00:36:26.818
If you want to be in the audience
you ran all or

1202

If you want to be in the audience
you can call or go to the Question

1203
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:28.318
you ran all or go to the Question

instructions. who knows where we
will be

1207
00:36:31.693 --> 00:36:32.943
instructions. Who knows where we
will be with this story next week or

1208
00:36:32.943 --> 00:36:36.401
will be with this story next week or
the week after. Let me take another

1209
00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:37.318
will be with this story next week or
the week after. Let me take another

1210
00:36:37.318 --> 00:36:38.943
the week after. Let me take another
question now from Chris Belton.

1211
00:36:38.943 --> 00:36:39.359
question now from Chris Bolton.
Thank you.

1212
00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:41.818
question now from Chris Belton.
Thank you. How will the government

1213
00:36:41.818 --> 00:36:44.026
Thank you. How will the government
ensure that providers of adult

1214
00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:45.359
ensure that providers of adult
social care are sufficiently

1215
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:48.026
social care are sufficiently
resourced to respond to the demands

1216
00:36:48.026 --> 00:36:50.109
resourced to respond to the demands
of coronavirus? You touched a little

1217
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:53.026
of coronavirus? You touched a little
bit on that but that is something a

1218
00:36:53.026 --> 00:36:53.526
bit on that but that is something a
lot of peopla

1219
00:36:53.526 --> 00:36:54.318
bit on that but that is something a
lot of people have been asking

1220
00:36:54.318 --> 00:36:54.651
lot of peopla have been asking
about. I

1221
00:36:54.651 --> 00:36:56.109
lot of people have been asking
about. I will come back to you in a

1222
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:59.359
about. I will come back to you in a
minute. You can deal with all these

1223
00:36:59.359 --> 00:36:59.901
minute. You ran deal with all these
questions in

1224
00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:01.526
minute. You can deal with all these
questions in some shape or form.

1225
00:37:01.526 --> 00:37:02.026
questions in some shape or form.
layla, do you

1226
00:37:02.026 --> 00:37:04.651
questions in some shape or form.
Layla, do you want to kick this off?

1227
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:05.443
layla, do you want to kick this off?
This is

1228
00:37:05.443 --> 00:37:06.318
Layla, do you want to kick this off?
This is probably the thing that

1229
00:37:06.318 --> 00:37:08.776
This is probably the thing that
worries me the most in my own

1230
00:37:08.776 --> 00:37:11.693
worries me the most in my own
family... who is

1231
00:37:11.693 --> 00:37:13.068
worries me the most in my own
family... Who is going to be there

1232
00:37:13.068 --> 00:37:13.901
family... who is going to be there
to look

1233
00:37:13.901 --> 00:37:15.693
family... Who is going to be there
to look after the older generation,

1234
00:37:15.693 --> 00:37:17.193
to look after the older generation,
especially as there is about one in

1235
00:37:17.193 --> 00:37:20.818
especially as there is about one in
ten jobs to fill in that sector? I

1236
00:37:20.818 --> 00:37:22.443
ten jobs to fill in that sector? I
think it’s 122,000 people are

1237
00:37:22.443 --> 00:37:27.443
think it’s 122,000 people are
needed. And if at any one time 20%

1238
00:37:27.443 --> 00:37:28.443
needed. And if at any one time 2096
of them go off

1239
00:37:28.443 --> 00:37:29.818
needed. And if at any one time 20%
of them go off sick, who will fill

1240
00:37:29.818 --> 00:37:33.318
of them go off sick, who will fill
in the gaps? I think this is why we

1241
00:37:33.318 --> 00:37:35.193
in the gaps? I think this is why we
I needed to solve this earlier. We

1242
00:37:35.193 --> 00:37:35.651
I needed to solve this eartier. We
have to

1243
00:37:35.651 --> 00:37:37.776
I needed to solve this earlier. We
have to do our best moving forward

1244
00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:38.984
have to do our best moving forward
and there will be people covering

1245
00:37:38.984 --> 00:37:40.859
and there will be people covering
for people at a time like this, the

1246
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:40.984
for peopla at a time like this, the
same

1247
00:37:40.984 --> 00:37:42.443
for people at a time like this, the
same with the NHS, in the end it

1248
00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:45.026
same with the NHS, in the end it
will be the doctors and nurses, it

1249
00:37:45.026 --> 00:37:47.359
will be the doctors and nurses, it
will be care staff who will cover

1250
00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:47.859
will be rare staff who will cover
for

1251
00:37:47.859 --> 00:37:49.109
will be care staff who will cover
for other care staff and burn

1252
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:50.651
for other care staff and burn
themselves out and they will rise to

1253
00:37:50.651 --> 00:37:52.484
themselves out and they will rise to
the challenge, I have absolutely no

1254
00:37:52.484 --> 00:37:52.901
the challange, I have absolutely no
doubt. I

1255
00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:55.318
the challenge, I have absolutely no
doubt. I thank them from the bottom

1256
00:37:55.318 --> 00:37:57.484
doubt. I thank them from the bottom
of my heart and I’m sure others as

1257
00:37:57.484 --> 00:37:58.901
of my heart and I’m sure others as
well as well, for what they are

1258
00:37:58.901 --> 00:38:02.151
well as well, for what they are
going to do, but nevertheless, we

1259
00:38:02.151 --> 00:38:03.484
going to do, but nevertheless, we
need to solve this problem as soon

1260
00:38:03.484 --> 00:38:05.109
need to solve this problem as soon
as possible. I very much hope that

1261
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:07.984
as possible. I very much hope that
this is the wake—up call that our

1262
00:38:07.984 --> 00:38:08.568
this is the wake-up call that our
country needs

1263
00:38:08.568 --> 00:38:10.901
this is the wake—up call that our
country needs for issues like adult

1264
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:11.318
country needs for issues like adult
social rare,

1265
00:38:11.318 --> 00:38:12.484
country needs for issues like adult
social care, also climate change,

1266
00:38:12.484 --> 00:38:12.859
social rare, also climate change,
also the

1267
00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:14.859
social care, also climate change,
also the others, because we can’t

1268
00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:17.318
also the others, because we can’t
wait. Chris, do you work in social

1269
00:38:17.318 --> 00:38:18.484
wait. Chris, do you work in social
rare? Curry

1270
00:38:18.484 --> 00:38:18.693
wait. Chris, do you work in social
rare? Curryl

1271
00:38:18.693 --> 00:38:18.943
wait. Chris, do you work in social
rare? Curry I do.

1272
00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:20.068
wait. Chris, do you work in social
care? Curry I do. What do you do and

1273
00:38:20.068 --> 00:38:20.651
rare? Curry I do. what do you do and
what are your

1274
00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:24.359
care? Curry I do. What do you do and
what are your concerns? I work in a

1275
00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:24.734
what are your concerns? I work in a
rare centre,

1276
00:38:24.734 --> 00:38:27.234
what are your concerns? I work in a
care centre, people with dementia.

1277
00:38:27.234 --> 00:38:27.651
rare centre, people with dementia.
But I’m

1278
00:38:27.651 --> 00:38:28.443
care centre, people with dementia.
But I’m also concerned about people

1279
00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:28.901
But I’m also concerned about peopla
living at

1280
00:38:28.901 --> 00:38:30.693
But I’m also concerned about people
living at home on their own or with

1281
00:38:30.693 --> 00:38:32.234
living at home on their own or with
carers who may be elderly

1282
00:38:32.234 --> 00:38:33.818
carers who may be elderly
themselves. It is about the number

1283
00:38:33.818 --> 00:38:36.151
themselves. It is about the number
of support staff who can help those

1284
00:38:36.151 --> 00:38:36.859
of support staff who ran help those
peopla. But I

1285
00:38:36.859 --> 00:38:37.568
of support staff who can help those
people. But I would imagine the

1286
00:38:37.568 --> 00:38:38.859
peopla. But I would imagine the
peopla that

1287
00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:41.359
people. But I would imagine the
people that run the services are

1288
00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:42.068
people that nm the services are
also saying

1289
00:38:42.068 --> 00:38:44.234
people that run the services are
also saying we can’t do it without

1290
00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:44.901
also saying we can’t do it without
additional financial resources.

1291
00:38:44.901 --> 00:38:45.026
also saying we can’t do it without
additionalfinancial resources. I

1292
00:38:45.026 --> 00:38:45.234
additional financial resources. I
think

1293
00:38:45.234 --> 00:38:46.776
additionalfinancial resources. I
think that is a key issue as well.

1294
00:38:46.776 --> 00:38:49.901
think that is a key issue as well.
In your rare

1295
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:50.901
think that is a key issue as well.
In your care centre are you having

1296
00:38:50.901 --> 00:38:51.109
In your rare centre are you having
these

1297
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:52.234
In your care centre are you having
these conversations? The government

1298
00:38:52.234 --> 00:38:54.234
these conversations? The government
has talked about a worst—case

1299
00:38:54.234 --> 00:38:54.693
has talked about a worst-case
scenario,

1300
00:38:54.693 --> 00:38:55.734
has talked about a worst—case
scenario, one in five falling ill,

1301
00:38:55.734 --> 00:38:57.234
scenario, one in five falling ill,
about what you would do, how you

1302
00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:59.484
about what you would do, how you
would look after the people you care

1303
00:38:59.484 --> 00:39:01.609
would look after the peopla you rare
for? I

1304
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:03.234
would look after the people you care
for? I think there are often crisis

1305
00:39:03.234 --> 00:39:05.359
for? I think there are often crisis
is within care centres brought on by

1306
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:05.484
is within rare centres brought on by
different

1307
00:39:05.484 --> 00:39:07.109
is within care centres brought on by
different things. This is probably

1308
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:09.484
different things. This is probably
the most challenging. I think people

1309
00:39:09.484 --> 00:39:09.818
the most challanging. I think peopla
are

1310
00:39:09.818 --> 00:39:10.234
the most challanging. I think peopla
arejust

1311
00:39:10.234 --> 00:39:10.484
the most challenging. I think people
arejust waiting,

1312
00:39:10.484 --> 00:39:11.359
the most challenging. I think people
are just waiting, knowing that they

1313
00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:13.484
are just waiting, knowing that they
will respond in some way, providing

1314
00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:15.651
will respond in some way, providing
they are well enough and if they are

1315
00:39:15.651 --> 00:39:16.734
they are well enough and if they are
not well enough, that their

1316
00:39:16.734 --> 00:39:17.901
not well enough, that their
colleagues will do it on their

1317
00:39:17.901 --> 00:39:20.859
colleagues will do it on their
behalf. Right, you step in and do

1318
00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:26.443
behalf. Right, you step in and do
your best. Margaret? Well, I was

1319
00:39:26.443 --> 00:39:27.234
your best. Margaret? Well, Iwas
just thinking, it

1320
00:39:27.234 --> 00:39:28.109
your best. Margaret? Well, I was
just thinking, it goes back to what

1321
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:30.818
just thinking, it goes back to what
the gentleman at the back said. In

1322
00:39:30.818 --> 00:39:32.276
the gentleman at the hack said. In
the end, I

1323
00:39:32.276 --> 00:39:32.651
the gentleman at the back said. In
the end, I suspect, I

1324
00:39:32.651 --> 00:39:33.276
the gentleman at the back said. In
the end, I suspect, Ifear,

1325
00:39:33.276 --> 00:39:33.901
the gentleman at the back said. In
the end, Isuspect, Ifear, that

1326
00:39:33.901 --> 00:39:34.109
the gentleman at the back said. In
the end, I suspect, I fear, that if

1327
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:35.151
the end, Isuspect, Ifear, that if
it does get bad,

1328
00:39:35.151 --> 00:39:35.859
the end, I suspect, I fear, that if
it does get bad, we will rely on

1329
00:39:35.859 --> 00:39:37.984
it does get bad, we will rely on
people to volunteer to help others

1330
00:39:37.984 --> 00:39:40.026
people to volunteer to help others
and a sense of community and

1331
00:39:40.026 --> 00:39:42.401
and a sense of community and
everybody looking after each other.

1332
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:45.443
everybody looking after each other.
And actually, although this is a

1333
00:39:45.443 --> 00:39:46.776
And actually, although this is a
terribly worrying situation, I’d

1334
00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:49.901
terribly worrying situation, I’d
rather like the idea that help and

1335
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:50.609
rather like the idea that help and
cooperation and friendliness and

1336
00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:52.484
cooperation and friendliness and
people being nice to each other for

1337
00:39:52.484 --> 00:39:59.984
people being nice to each other for
a change, may spread. APPLAUSE

1338
00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:04.484
Talking of cooperation, one of the
suggestions that has come from

1339
00:40:04.484 --> 00:40:07.026
suggestions that has come from
government is the doctors, nurses

1340
00:40:07.026 --> 00:40:09.109
government is the doctors, nurses
who have retired to come back into

1341
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:11.776
who have retired to come back into
help. Is there anyone here in that

1342
00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.609
help. Is there anyone here in that
situation who might consider... Yes,

1343
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:15.234
situation who might consider... Yes,
you and the front? We will

1344
00:40:15.234 --> 00:40:15.984
situation who might consider... Yes,
you and the front? We willjust get

1345
00:40:15.984 --> 00:40:17.818
you and the front? We will just get
a microphone

1346
00:40:17.818 --> 00:40:18.609
you and the front? We willjust get
a microphone two, one second. Yes,

1347
00:40:18.609 --> 00:40:21.359
a microphone two, one second. Yes,
so you are a forward nurse or

1348
00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:24.443
so you are a forward nurse or
doctor? Retired staff nurse, I

1349
00:40:24.443 --> 00:40:27.984
doctor? Retired staff nurse, I
retired 15 years ago. I

1350
00:40:27.984 --> 00:40:28.193
doctor? Retired staff nurse, I
retired 15 years ago. Ijust

1351
00:40:28.193 --> 00:40:28.568
doctor? Retired staff nurse, I
retired 15 years ago. I just feel...

1352
00:40:28.568 --> 00:40:30.401
retired 15 years ago. I just feel...
I wouldn’t feel very comfortable

1353
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:34.568
I wouldn’t feel very comfortable
after being away for so long, back

1354
00:40:34.568 --> 00:40:35.984
after being away for so long, back
in the workplace. Then there is also

1355
00:40:35.984 --> 00:40:38.068
in the workplace. Then there is also
the question of registration. I have

1356
00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:39.359
the question of registration. I have
given up my registration, so that

1357
00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:42.484
given up my registration, so that
would need to be taken care of as

1358
00:40:42.484 --> 00:40:43.234
would need to be taken rare of as
well. You

1359
00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:44.276
would need to be taken care of as
well. You would have to train for

1360
00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:47.818
well. You would have to train for
that? There is a back to nursing

1361
00:40:47.818 --> 00:40:50.193
that? There is a back to nursing
course, yes, you would have to do a

1362
00:40:50.193 --> 00:40:52.026
course, yes, you would have to do a
back to nursing course. Is it

1363
00:40:52.026 --> 00:40:54.401
back to nursing course. Is it
something that appeals to you or

1364
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:57.693
something that appeals to you or
does it seem impractical? Not at my

1365
00:40:57.693 --> 00:40:59.776
does it seem impractical? Not at my
age! Xand com you have been a

1366
00:40:59.776 --> 00:41:01.734
age! Xand com you have been a
practising doctor

1367
00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:02.068
age! Xand com you have been a
practising doctorfor a

1368
00:41:02.068 --> 00:41:02.359
age! Xand com you have been a
practising doctor for a while.

1369
00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:02.484
age! Xand com you have been a
practising doctorfor a while. I

1370
00:41:02.484 --> 00:41:02.943
practising doctor for a while. I
spent ten

1371
00:41:02.943 --> 00:41:04.151
practising doctorfor a while. I
spent ten years working in the NHS

1372
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:07.443
spent ten years working in the NHS
but I haven’t in years. No one has

1373
00:41:07.443 --> 00:41:08.984
but I haven’t in years. No one has
contacted me yet to demand my

1374
00:41:08.984 --> 00:41:11.484
contacted me yet to demand my
services. I could always swap in as

1375
00:41:11.484 --> 00:41:12.984
services. I could always swap in as
my identical twin brother who is

1376
00:41:12.984 --> 00:41:15.068
my identical twin brother who is
front line NHS staff and he would be

1377
00:41:15.068 --> 00:41:15.651
front line NHS staff and he would be
grateful for that.

1378
00:41:15.651 --> 00:41:15.859
front line NHS staff and he would be
gratefulforthat. I

1379
00:41:15.859 --> 00:41:17.068
front line NHS staff and he would be
grateful for that. I totally echo

1380
00:41:17.068 --> 00:41:18.443
grateful for that. I totally echo
what you are saying. It is

1381
00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:20.318
what you are saying. It is
enormously, you don’t have to have

1382
00:41:20.318 --> 00:41:22.234
enormously, you don’t have to have
been out of practice for very long

1383
00:41:22.234 --> 00:41:24.401
been out of practice for very long
to be de—skilled. I think the idea

1384
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:25.776
to be tie-skilled. I think the idea
of a Dad’s

1385
00:41:25.776 --> 00:41:27.776
to be de—skilled. I think the idea
of a Dad’s Army of health care

1386
00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:29.026
of a Dad’s Army of health care
professionals is quite charming,

1387
00:41:29.026 --> 00:41:32.318
professionals is quite charming,
quite British. I do think that there

1388
00:41:32.318 --> 00:41:35.443
quite British. I do think that there
is an enormous role for individuals

1389
00:41:35.443 --> 00:41:35.609
is an enormous rola for individuals
with

1390
00:41:35.609 --> 00:41:37.068
is an enormous role for individuals
with expertise to provide help and

1391
00:41:37.068 --> 00:41:37.859
with expertise to provide help and
rare in

1392
00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:39.068
with expertise to provide help and
care in their communities, to their

1393
00:41:39.068 --> 00:41:39.234
rare in their communities, to their
family

1394
00:41:39.234 --> 00:41:40.776
care in their communities, to their
family members. I would certainly be

1395
00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:44.401
family members. I would certainly be
prepared to step up in that. But the

1396
00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.568
prepared to step up in that. But the
issue of registration, terms of

1397
00:41:46.568 --> 00:41:48.026
issue of registration, terms of
response polity, insurance, payment,

1398
00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:49.818
response polity, insurance, payment,
all these things are pretty

1399
00:41:49.818 --> 00:41:55.859
all these things are pretty
complicated. It feels to me like

1400
00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:58.401
complicated. It feels to me like
that as a backbone of the response

1401
00:41:58.401 --> 00:41:59.859
that as a backbone of the response
won’t be a significant contribution.

1402
00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:03.193
won’t be a significant contribution.
I would say, I think a couple of

1403
00:42:03.193 --> 00:42:03.609
I would say, I think a couple of
peopla have

1404
00:42:03.609 --> 00:42:04.651
I would say, I think a couple of
people have raised this idea and

1405
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:06.568
people have raised this idea and
Margaret raised it so eloquently of

1406
00:42:06.568 --> 00:42:09.401
Margaret raised it so eloquently of
us helping each other. This epidemic

1407
00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:10.193
us helping each other. This epidemic
demonstrates one thing incredibly

1408
00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:10.651
demonstrates one thing incredibly
dearty. That

1409
00:42:10.651 --> 00:42:12.359
demonstrates one thing incredibly
clearly. That we are all as

1410
00:42:12.359 --> 00:42:13.484
clearly. That we are all as
vulnerable as the most vulnerable

1411
00:42:13.484 --> 00:42:15.109
vulnerable as the most vulnerable
people among us. When you look

1412
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.151
peopla among us. when you look
across

1413
00:42:15.151 --> 00:42:17.859
people among us. When you look
across the Atlantic, you see a group

1414
00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:18.484
across the Atlantic, you see a group
of peopla, 30

1415
00:42:18.484 --> 00:42:19.151
across the Atlantic, you see a group
of people, 30 million Americans with

1416
00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:19.401
of peopla, 30 million Americans with
no

1417
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:20.818
of people, 30 million Americans with
no insurance or access to adequate

1418
00:42:20.818 --> 00:42:23.068
no insurance or access to adequate
health care and many of them in

1419
00:42:23.068 --> 00:42:23.276
health rare and many of them in
precarious

1420
00:42:23.276 --> 00:42:24.193
health care and many of them in
precarious employment. We have a

1421
00:42:24.193 --> 00:42:27.193
precarious employment. We have a
better social safety net and

1422
00:42:27.193 --> 00:42:28.193
better social safety net and
institution and we should treasure

1423
00:42:28.193 --> 00:42:29.818
institution and we should treasure
it because those are the things that

1424
00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:32.859
it because those are the things that
keep us safe. APPLAUSE

1425
00:42:39.068 --> 00:42:41.651
On the point about social care

1426
00:42:41.651 --> 00:42:42.068
On the point about social rare
funding I

1427
00:42:42.068 --> 00:42:43.943
On the point about social care
funding I don’t want to break up the

1428
00:42:43.943 --> 00:42:46.401
funding I don’t want to break up the
Kumbaya moment. Is that what you are

1429
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:46.526
Kumbaya moment. Is that what you are
falling

1430
00:42:46.526 --> 00:42:47.901
Kumbaya moment. Is that what you are
calling it?! All three parties have

1431
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:52.526
calling it?! All three parties have
been in power and have failed to

1432
00:42:52.526 --> 00:42:55.401
been in power and have failed to
tackle the issue of the funding

1433
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:57.318
tackle the issue of the funding
formula for the care sector. That

1434
00:42:57.318 --> 00:42:57.526
formula for the rare sector. That
includes

1435
00:42:57.526 --> 00:42:58.526
formula for the care sector. That
includes the Lib Dems. One reason

1436
00:42:58.526 --> 00:43:00.818
includes the Lib Dems. One reason
why they have failed to do that is

1437
00:43:00.818 --> 00:43:02.318
why they have failed to do that is
because of budget cuts, austerity,

1438
00:43:02.318 --> 00:43:04.818
because of budget cuts, austerity,
which was passed on to local

1439
00:43:04.818 --> 00:43:07.276
which was passed on to local
government, which is where so many

1440
00:43:07.276 --> 00:43:08.484
government, which is where so many
sacrifices were made. Local

1441
00:43:08.484 --> 00:43:09.693
sacrifices were made. Local
governments couldn’t raise taxes

1442
00:43:09.693 --> 00:43:11.818
governments couldn’t raise taxes
unless they had a referendum so they

1443
00:43:11.818 --> 00:43:14.359
unless they had a referendum so they
didn’t have the funds to do it. And

1444
00:43:14.359 --> 00:43:15.734
didn’t have the funds to do it. And
politicians were reluctant to ask us

1445
00:43:15.734 --> 00:43:17.359
politicians were reluctant to ask us
to sell a property or two in some

1446
00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:17.484
to sell a property or two in some
“Y

1447
00:43:17.484 --> 00:43:20.068
to sell a property or two in some
way after we have passed on, to use

1448
00:43:20.068 --> 00:43:21.943
way after we have passed on, to use
that property to finance our own

1449
00:43:21.943 --> 00:43:22.359
that property to finance our own
rare. So

1450
00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:23.526
that property to finance our own
care. 50 the reason why the money

1451
00:43:23.526 --> 00:43:23.901
rare. So the reason why the money
isn’t there

1452
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.651
care. 50 the reason why the money
isn’t there is because this issue

1453
00:43:25.651 --> 00:43:28.151
isn’t there is because this issue
has been dodged. On the point about

1454
00:43:28.151 --> 00:43:29.318
has been dodged. On the point about
volunteering and stepping up. People

1455
00:43:29.318 --> 00:43:31.193
volunteering and stepping up. People
of course do that all the time

1456
00:43:31.193 --> 00:43:33.901
of course do that all the time
already. People do that by caring

1457
00:43:33.901 --> 00:43:34.484
already. People do that by raring
for their

1458
00:43:34.484 --> 00:43:35.818
already. People do that by caring
for their relatives as it is. I’ve

1459
00:43:35.818 --> 00:43:38.443
for their relatives as it is. I’ve
been thinking about this crisis from

1460
00:43:38.443 --> 00:43:39.818
been thinking about this crisis from
a Christian perspective. It strikes

1461
00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:42.484
a Christian perspective. It strikes
me that back in the dim and distant

1462
00:43:42.484 --> 00:43:43.901
me that back in the dim and distant
past, whenever something odd like

1463
00:43:43.901 --> 00:43:45.276
past, whenever something odd like
this happened, people always assumed

1464
00:43:45.276 --> 00:43:48.401
this happened, people always assumed
it was a punishment from God.

1465
00:43:48.401 --> 00:43:50.609
it was a punishment from God.
Western society has changed.

1466
00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:51.651
Western society has changed.
Increasingly, the way we

1467
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:52.734
Increasingly, the way we
theologically think about disasters

1468
00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:55.859
theologically think about disasters
like this is it is a test of us.

1469
00:43:55.859 --> 00:43:56.026
like this is it is a test of us.
when

1470
00:43:56.026 --> 00:43:57.984
like this is it is a test of us.
When one asks where is God in this

1471
00:43:57.984 --> 00:43:58.484
when one asks where is God in this
scenario?

1472
00:43:58.484 --> 00:44:00.401
When one asks where is God in this
scenario? It is in whether or not we

1473
00:44:00.401 --> 00:44:03.651
scenario? It is in whether or not we
step up and do our duty. 50 this is

1474
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:04.109
step up and do our duty. So this is
awful, peopla

1475
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:05.318
step up and do our duty. 50 this is
awful, people are worried. We will

1476
00:44:05.318 --> 00:44:06.318
awful, peopla are worried. We will
get through it,

1477
00:44:06.318 --> 00:44:07.151
awful, people are worried. We will
get through it, I’m sure. Look upon

1478
00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:11.318
get through it, I’m sure. Look upon
it also as a test of us, as

1479
00:44:11.318 --> 00:44:12.776
it also as a test of us, as
individuals. I think right now, it

1480
00:44:12.776 --> 00:44:14.943
individuals. I think right now, it
feels as though we are passing that

1481
00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:20.193
feels as though we are passing that
test. APPLAUSE

1482
00:44:21.151 --> 00:44:21.318
test. APPLAUSE
So,

1483
00:44:21.318 --> 00:44:22.651
test. APPLAUSE
50, Matt, picking up on two of the

1484
00:44:22.651 --> 00:44:23.151
So, Matt, picking up on two of the
things. The

1485
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:23.484
50, Matt, picking up on two of the
things. The concerns about

1486
00:44:23.484 --> 00:44:23.943
So, Matt, picking up on two of the
things. The concerns about who will

1487
00:44:23.943 --> 00:44:25.193
things. The concerns about who will
look after those who can’t look

1488
00:44:25.193 --> 00:44:27.359
look after those who can’t look
after themselves in a social care

1489
00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:27.693
after themselves in a social rare
setting, for

1490
00:44:27.693 --> 00:44:28.609
after themselves in a social care
setting, for example. Then this idea

1491
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:35.318
setting, for example. Then this idea
of getting a Dad’s Army... Of

1492
00:44:35.318 --> 00:44:37.859
of getting a Dad’s Army... Of
doctors and nurses. On that point...

1493
00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:41.318
doctors and nurses. On that point...
On that point first of all, are you

1494
00:44:41.318 --> 00:44:42.109
On that point first of all, are you
considering changing registration or

1495
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:43.484
considering changing registration or
relaxing the rules so doctors and

1496
00:44:43.484 --> 00:44:43.568
relaxing the mles so doctors and
nurses

1497
00:44:43.568 --> 00:44:46.901
relaxing the rules so doctors and
nurses can come back more easily?

1498
00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:47.734
nurses ran come back more easily?
Yes. We do

1499
00:44:47.734 --> 00:44:51.026
nurses can come back more easily?
Yes. We do want people who are

1500
00:44:51.026 --> 00:44:53.859
Yes. We do want people who are
qualified but also especially those

1501
00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:55.651
qualified but also especially those
who are... Who have very recent

1502
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:56.859
who are... who have very recent
experience, to

1503
00:44:56.859 --> 00:44:58.484
who are... Who have very recent
experience, to be able to come back

1504
00:44:58.484 --> 00:45:00.484
experience, to be able to come back
in. We will change the rules around

1505
00:45:00.484 --> 00:45:00.859
in. We will change the mles around
registration

1506
00:45:00.859 --> 00:45:02.484
in. We will change the rules around
registration that were raised to

1507
00:45:02.484 --> 00:45:05.318
registration that were raised to
make that easier. And also make it

1508
00:45:05.318 --> 00:45:07.151
make that easier. And also make it
easier to volunteer, because

1509
00:45:07.151 --> 00:45:08.318
easier to volunteer, because
volunteers, so the point about the

1510
00:45:08.318 --> 00:45:10.484
volunteers, so the point about the
community having a role to play,

1511
00:45:10.484 --> 00:45:10.693
community having a rola to play,
volunteering,

1512
00:45:10.693 --> 00:45:13.484
community having a role to play,
volunteering, people volunteering to

1513
00:45:13.484 --> 00:45:15.943
volunteering, people volunteering to
help, for instance in social care,

1514
00:45:15.943 --> 00:45:16.443
help, for instance in social rare,
is incredibly

1515
00:45:16.443 --> 00:45:17.026
help, for instance in social care,
is incredibly important. But you

1516
00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:19.026
is incredibly important. But you
have to make sure you get the skill

1517
00:45:19.026 --> 00:45:22.693
have to make sure you get the skill
set right, so that treatment is safe

1518
00:45:22.693 --> 00:45:26.943
set right, so that treatment is safe
and people are looked after. So

1519
00:45:26.943 --> 00:45:28.151
and people are looked after. So
volunteers, people making a

1520
00:45:28.151 --> 00:45:29.484
volunteers, peopla making a
voluntary

1521
00:45:29.484 --> 00:45:30.359
volunteers, people making a
voluntary effort is really, really

1522
00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:32.484
voluntary effort is really, really
important and will be one part of

1523
00:45:32.484 --> 00:45:34.443
important and will be one part of
the response. But it couldn’t by no

1524
00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:37.734
the response. But it couldn’t by no
means he the whole part. I’m also

1525
00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:41.443
means he the whole part. I’m also
the Secretary of State for so care.

1526
00:45:41.443 --> 00:45:41.776
the Secretary of State for so rare.
Getting the

1527
00:45:41.776 --> 00:45:43.901
the Secretary of State for so care.
Getting the response rate in social

1528
00:45:43.901 --> 00:45:44.401
Getting the response rate in social
rare is

1529
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:46.026
Getting the response rate in social
care is absolutely vital for this.

1530
00:45:46.026 --> 00:45:46.359
rare is absolutely vital for this.
Not

1531
00:45:46.359 --> 00:45:49.526
care is absolutely vital for this.
Not least because one of the facets

1532
00:45:49.526 --> 00:45:56.359
Not least because one of the facets
of this virus is that... The impact

1533
00:45:56.359 --> 00:45:57.901
of this virus is that... The impact
is are highly correlated with age.

1534
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:00.401
is are highly correlated with age.
One of the saving graces is children

1535
00:46:00.401 --> 00:46:02.068
One of the saving graces is children
appear not to have any symptoms

1536
00:46:02.068 --> 00:46:04.901
appear not to have any symptoms
except in a rare number of cases.

1537
00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:10.318
except in a rare number of cases.
But it does have a particularly bad

1538
00:46:10.318 --> 00:46:10.901
But it does have a particularty bad
impact on

1539
00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.109
But it does have a particularly bad
impact on people either with

1540
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:13.818
impact on people either with
pre—existing health conditions or

1541
00:46:13.818 --> 00:46:14.276
pre-existing health conditions or
who are

1542
00:46:14.276 --> 00:46:18.318
pre—existing health conditions or
who are older. What will you do when

1543
00:46:18.318 --> 00:46:18.901
who are older. what will you do when
the carers

1544
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:19.943
who are older. What will you do when
the carers are ill? We are putting

1545
00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:21.901
the carers are ill? We are putting
more money on, there is an increase

1546
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:22.484
more money on, there is an increase
in [oral authority

1547
00:46:22.484 --> 00:46:23.109
more money on, there is an increase
in local authority budgets coming at

1548
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.609
in [oral authority budgets coming at
the end

1549
00:46:23.609 --> 00:46:25.026
in local authority budgets coming at
the end of this month, so they can

1550
00:46:25.026 --> 00:46:25.526
the end of this month, so they ran
plan for that

1551
00:46:25.526 --> 00:46:26.901
the end of this month, so they can
plan for that now. And making sure

1552
00:46:26.901 --> 00:46:31.359
plan for that now. And making sure
that that resource is there, that is

1553
00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:33.693
that that resource is there, that is
important, but so also is the staff,

1554
00:46:33.693 --> 00:46:36.859
important, but so also is the staff,
exactly as you said. It is

1555
00:46:36.859 --> 00:46:38.776
exactly as you said. It is
particularly important in social

1556
00:46:38.776 --> 00:46:39.318
particularty important in social
rare, in a

1557
00:46:39.318 --> 00:46:41.401
particularly important in social
care, in a residential setting,

1558
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:42.609
rare, in a residential setting,
where many

1559
00:46:42.609 --> 00:46:43.693
care, in a residential setting,
where many of the residents

1560
00:46:43.693 --> 00:46:46.026
where many of the residents
themselves will be frail and older.

1561
00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:46.901
themselves will be frail and older.
So this

1562
00:46:46.901 --> 00:46:47.901
themselves will be frail and older.
50 this is a particular concern. We

1563
00:46:47.901 --> 00:46:51.068
So this is a particular concern. We
have more guidance for you coming

1564
00:46:51.068 --> 00:46:53.609
have more guidance for you coming
out next week. It is something we

1565
00:46:53.609 --> 00:46:55.609
out next week. It is something we
are working incredibly hard on. On

1566
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:57.568
are working incredibly hard on. On
the longer term point... Boris

1567
00:46:57.568 --> 00:46:58.484
the longer term point... Boris
johnson said

1568
00:46:58.484 --> 00:46:59.776
the longer term point... Boris
Johnson said he had a plan ready to

1569
00:46:59.776 --> 00:47:00.526
johnson said he had a plan ready to
go on the steps

1570
00:47:00.526 --> 00:47:02.359
Johnson said he had a plan ready to
go on the steps of Downing Street?

1571
00:47:02.359 --> 00:47:04.693
go on the steps of Downing Street?
It is best done on a cross—party

1572
00:47:04.693 --> 00:47:05.443
It is best done on a cross-party
basis. I

1573
00:47:05.443 --> 00:47:06.943
It is best done on a cross—party
basis. I think the spirit of this

1574
00:47:06.943 --> 00:47:10.359
basis. I think the spirit of this
panel is a good run in order to make

1575
00:47:10.359 --> 00:47:11.318
panel is a good nm in order to make
changes to social

1576
00:47:11.318 --> 00:47:11.943
panel is a good run in order to make
changes to social care. My thought

1577
00:47:11.943 --> 00:47:12.318
changes to social rare. My thought
is the

1578
00:47:12.318 --> 00:47:13.276
changes to social care. My thought
is the reason it hasn’t been cracked

1579
00:47:13.276 --> 00:47:14.484
is the reason it hasn’t been cracked
under governments of all colours

1580
00:47:14.484 --> 00:47:17.443
under governments of all colours
over the last 20 years has been...

1581
00:47:17.443 --> 00:47:19.484
over the last 20 years has been...
It’s been a failure of political

1582
00:47:19.484 --> 00:47:22.276
It’s been a failure of political
economy rather than of policy. I

1583
00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:25.318
economy rather than of policy. I
also point out, we had choices and

1584
00:47:25.318 --> 00:47:26.443
also point out, we had choices and
in elections Liberal Democrats put

1585
00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:27.984
in elections Liberal Democrats put
forward things like a penny on the

1586
00:47:27.984 --> 00:47:30.109
forward things like a penny on the
pound on income tax to go directly

1587
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:32.318
pound on income tax to go directly
into the NHS and adult social care.

1588
00:47:32.318 --> 00:47:33.193
into the NHS and adult social rare.
So I reject that

1589
00:47:33.193 --> 00:47:34.859
into the NHS and adult social care.
50 I reject that it is a case that

1590
00:47:34.859 --> 00:47:35.443
So I reject that it is a use that
we

1591
00:47:35.443 --> 00:47:37.109
So I reject that it is a case that
we haven’t been brave enough to ask.

1592
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:38.693
we haven’t been brave enough to ask.
But I really hope that this

1593
00:47:38.693 --> 00:47:40.859
But I really hope that this
cross—party commission is going to

1594
00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:41.859
cross-party commission is going to
come up with

1595
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:42.901
cross—party commission is going to
come up with how do we sustainably

1596
00:47:42.901 --> 00:47:45.693
come up with how do we sustainably
longer term fund this issue? Because

1597
00:47:45.693 --> 00:47:47.859
longer term fund this issue? Because
unless we do this cross—party, it is

1598
00:47:47.859 --> 00:47:50.109
unless we do this cross-party, it is
going to be a ten,

1599
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:51.109
unless we do this cross—party, it is
going to be a ten, 20 year endeavour

1600
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:53.318
going to be a ten, 20 year endeavour
and I’m deeply concerned that it is

1601
00:47:53.318 --> 00:47:55.068
and I’m deeply concerned that it is
going to get dodged again and kicked

1602
00:47:55.068 --> 00:47:57.693
going to get dodged again and kicked
into the long grass. Let’s meet up

1603
00:47:57.693 --> 00:48:00.276
into the long grass. Let’s meet up
when we are back and the offer is

1604
00:48:00.276 --> 00:48:02.318
when we are back and the offer is
there for you as well, Margaret, and

1605
00:48:02.318 --> 00:48:06.901
there for you as well, Margaret, and
let’s take this forward. We had a

1606
00:48:06.901 --> 00:48:07.068
let’s take this forward. We had a
cross-party

1607
00:48:07.068 --> 00:48:07.693
let’s take this forward. We had a
cross—party commission when Andy

1608
00:48:07.693 --> 00:48:08.068
cross-party commission when Andy
Burnham

1609
00:48:08.068 --> 00:48:09.276
cross—party commission when Andy
Burnham was Secretary of State. It

1610
00:48:09.276 --> 00:48:12.109
Burnham was Secretary of State. It
got very close, we thought, to

1611
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:13.234
got very close, we thought, to
agreement. Then David Cameron pulled

1612
00:48:13.234 --> 00:48:15.651
agreement. Then David Cameron pulled
the plug end we haven’t had a

1613
00:48:15.651 --> 00:48:16.901
the plug end we haven’t had a
successful one since. I can see

1614
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:18.484
successful one since. I can see
quite a few of you have your hands

1615
00:48:18.484 --> 00:48:21.651
quite a few of you have your hands
up. I’m going to move on, if I may.

1616
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:23.568
up. I’m going to move on, if I may.
As you take your hands down, I’m

1617
00:48:23.568 --> 00:48:25.734
As you take your hands down, I’m
sorry! The question I am coming to

1618
00:48:25.734 --> 00:48:27.568
sorry! The question I am coming to
Next, lots of you asked about this

1619
00:48:27.568 --> 00:48:29.068
Next, lots of you asked about this
as well. I don’t think I would be

1620
00:48:29.068 --> 00:48:30.568
as well. I don’t think I would be
doing the right thing if we didn’t

1621
00:48:30.568 --> 00:48:34.068
doing the right thing if we didn’t
come to it. I would like to hear

1622
00:48:34.068 --> 00:48:35.484
come to it. I would like to hear
from Dale Fairless, please. Has

1623
00:48:35.484 --> 00:48:36.318
from Dale Fairlass, please. Has
Priti

1624
00:48:36.318 --> 00:48:38.068
from Dale Fairless, please. Has
Priti Patel’s position as Home

1625
00:48:38.068 --> 00:48:38.276
Priti Patel’s position as Home
Secretary

1626
00:48:38.276 --> 00:48:39.651
Priti Patel’s position as Home
Secretary become untenable after the

1627
00:48:39.651 --> 00:48:42.651
Secretary become untenable after the
recent claims of bullying? Margaret,

1628
00:48:42.651 --> 00:48:45.401
recent claims of bullying? Margaret,
do you want to kick us off on that?

1629
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:46.484
do you want to kick us off on that?
It dearty has

1630
00:48:46.484 --> 00:48:47.443
do you want to kick us off on that?
It clearly has become untenable

1631
00:48:47.443 --> 00:48:49.443
It clearly has become untenable
because she is still there. LAUGHTER

1632
00:48:49.443 --> 00:48:51.068
because she is still there. MUGHTER
Do you think

1633
00:48:51.068 --> 00:48:52.568
because she is still there. LAUGHTER
Do you think she will last? I think

1634
00:48:52.568 --> 00:48:54.609
Do you think she will last? I think
it’s getting close. I think the

1635
00:48:54.609 --> 00:48:57.859
it’s getting close. I think the
thing that is... She’s clearly...

1636
00:48:57.859 --> 00:48:58.484
thing that is... She’s dearty...
This isn’t

1637
00:48:58.484 --> 00:49:00.318
thing that is... She’s clearly...
This isn’t somebody I know well, at

1638
00:49:00.318 --> 00:49:02.318
This isn’t somebody I know well, at
all. Looking at the range of

1639
00:49:02.318 --> 00:49:04.151
all. Looking at the range of
comments, it does seem to me that

1640
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:07.943
comments, it does seem to me that
she is somebody who can be very

1641
00:49:07.943 --> 00:49:08.318
she is somebody who ran be very
charming to

1642
00:49:08.318 --> 00:49:08.859
she is somebody who can be very
charming to important colleagues

1643
00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:11.026
charming to important colleagues
around her and they all think she’s

1644
00:49:11.026 --> 00:49:12.859
around her and they all think she’s
absolutely great, but if you are not

1645
00:49:12.859 --> 00:49:14.234
absolutely great, but if you are not
an important collie, it might not be

1646
00:49:14.234 --> 00:49:16.859
an important collie, it might not be
quite so easy. I think the thing

1647
00:49:16.859 --> 00:49:20.568
quite so easy. I think the thing
that is difficult for her is that

1648
00:49:20.568 --> 00:49:22.484
that is difficult for her is that
there is a pattern and there is a

1649
00:49:22.484 --> 00:49:23.943
there is a pattern and there is a
whole set of different departments.

1650
00:49:23.943 --> 00:49:25.943
whole set of different departments.
If it was one department, you might

1651
00:49:25.943 --> 00:49:29.484
If it was one department, you might
think that was it. It is in three of

1652
00:49:29.484 --> 00:49:30.484
think that was it. It is in three of
the four government departments

1653
00:49:30.484 --> 00:49:32.401
the four government departments
she’s worked in. One thing that is

1654
00:49:32.401 --> 00:49:34.026
she’s worked in. One thing that is
important to say, it gets very

1655
00:49:34.026 --> 00:49:36.943
important to say, it gets very
misleading. In my experience, which

1656
00:49:36.943 --> 00:49:39.109
misleading. In my experience, which
is reasonably substantial, there is

1657
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.234
is reasonably substantial, there is
nothing civil servants like more

1658
00:49:40.234 --> 00:49:41.901
nothing civil servants like more
than a minister who knows what they

1659
00:49:41.901 --> 00:49:43.318
than a minister who knows what they
want and nothing they hate more than

1660
00:49:43.318 --> 00:49:45.359
want and nothing they hate more than
a minister who doesn’t know what

1661
00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:48.401
a minister who doesn’t know what
they want. So the notion that

1662
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:50.526
they want. So the notion that
somehow this civil service doesn’t

1663
00:49:50.526 --> 00:49:51.984
somehow this civil service doesn’t
like ministers who have policies

1664
00:49:51.984 --> 00:49:53.401
like ministers who have policies
that they want to pursue and know

1665
00:49:53.401 --> 00:49:56.484
that they want to pursue and know
how they want to go about it is just

1666
00:49:56.484 --> 00:49:57.609
how they want to go about it is just
rubbish. Of course, what the

1667
00:49:57.609 --> 00:49:59.068
rubbish. Of course, what the
minister wants is unrealistic or

1668
00:49:59.068 --> 00:50:00.109
minister wants is unrealistic or
unlawful or something,

1669
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.318
minister wants is unrealistic or
unlawful orsomething, I

1670
00:50:00.318 --> 00:50:00.526
minister wants is unrealistic or
unlawful or something, I appreciate

1671
00:50:00.526 --> 00:50:03.818
unlawful or something, I appreciate
it may be difficult. Tim? APPLAUSE

1672
00:50:08.984 --> 00:50:11.318
This is more like it, we can go back

1673
00:50:11.318 --> 00:50:11.901
This is more like it, we ran go back
to tearing lumps

1674
00:50:11.901 --> 00:50:15.984
This is more like it, we can go back
to tearing lumps out of each other.

1675
00:50:15.984 --> 00:50:17.859
to tearing lumps out of each other.
Less Kumbaya! Exactly. Two things.

1676
00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:22.109
Less Kumbaya! Exactly. Two things.
One is that it feels like there is a

1677
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:23.109
One is that it feels like there is a
party political briefing operation

1678
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:26.484
party political briefing operation
against Priti Patel taking place.

1679
00:50:26.484 --> 00:50:27.901
against Priti Patel taking place.
Secondly, there is a broad context

1680
00:50:27.901 --> 00:50:29.693
Secondly, there is a broad context
which is that the government has a

1681
00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.734
which is that the government has a
lot it wants to do in the next year

1682
00:50:31.734 --> 00:50:32.901
lot it wants to do in the next year
and probably the Home Office has

1683
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:35.026
and probably the Home Office has
more than any other department has

1684
00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:36.443
more than any other department has
to do, including things like

1685
00:50:36.443 --> 00:50:38.151
to do, including things like
tackling knife crime and introducing

1686
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:39.901
tackling knife crime and introducing
a new immigration system in time for

1687
00:50:39.901 --> 00:50:41.151
a new immigration system in time for
the proper Brexit when it finally

1688
00:50:41.151 --> 00:50:44.776
the proper Brexit when it finally
comes. So the Home Secretary is

1689
00:50:44.776 --> 00:50:46.484
comes. So the Home Secretary is
probably cracking the whip and

1690
00:50:46.484 --> 00:50:47.984
probably cracking the whip and
trying to get civil servants to do

1691
00:50:47.984 --> 00:50:49.943
trying to get civil servants to do
things which in some cases, they

1692
00:50:49.943 --> 00:50:51.193
things which in some cases, they
possibly don’t feel they have the

1693
00:50:51.193 --> 00:50:54.109
possibly don’t feel they have the
resources or the time to do. And

1694
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:55.443
resources or the time to do. And
unfortunately, one suspects some of

1695
00:50:55.443 --> 00:50:56.818
unfortunately, one suspects some of
the civil servants don’t want to do

1696
00:50:56.818 --> 00:51:00.318
the civil servants don’t want to do
these things. We can’t say if these

1697
00:51:00.318 --> 00:51:01.484
these things. We can’t say if these
allegations are true, but some of

1698
00:51:01.484 --> 00:51:03.318
allegations are true, but some of
them go back about five years, well

1699
00:51:03.318 --> 00:51:05.484
them go back about five years, well
before what you are talking about.

1700
00:51:05.484 --> 00:51:08.859
before what you are talking about.
That element is a he said/ she said

1701
00:51:08.859 --> 00:51:12.026
That element is a he said/ she said
thing. If there’s any bullying in

1702
00:51:12.026 --> 00:51:12.818
thing. If there’s any bullying in
any department, including John

1703
00:51:12.818 --> 00:51:14.984
any department, including John
Bercow if he was guilty of that,

1704
00:51:14.984 --> 00:51:17.276
Bercow if he was guilty of that,
that would be unacceptable too. If

1705
00:51:17.276 --> 00:51:19.484
that would be unacceptable too. If
Priti Patel was guilty of that, that

1706
00:51:19.484 --> 00:51:21.401
Priti Patel was guilty of that, that
would be acceptable. But I think

1707
00:51:21.401 --> 00:51:24.068
would be acceptabla. But I think
there is

1708
00:51:24.068 --> 00:51:25.026
would be acceptable. But I think
there is a political context to this

1709
00:51:25.026 --> 00:51:26.484
there is a political context to this
which makes me suspicious of some of

1710
00:51:26.484 --> 00:51:27.901
which makes me suspicious of some of
the politics going on behind the

1711
00:51:27.901 --> 00:51:28.109
the politic going on behind the
scenes.

1712
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:29.526
the politics going on behind the
scenes. She has a lot of things that

1713
00:51:29.526 --> 00:51:31.318
scenes. She has a lot of things that
she wants to get done and

1714
00:51:31.318 --> 00:51:32.568
she wants to get done and
unfortunately, parts of the civil

1715
00:51:32.568 --> 00:51:34.484
unfortunately, parts of the civil
service have come to regard

1716
00:51:34.484 --> 00:51:36.026
service have come to regard
themselves as a sort of

1717
00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:36.901
themselves as a sort of
constitutional checkup on the

1718
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:40.484
constitutional checkup on the
executive, that they are there to

1719
00:51:40.484 --> 00:51:43.359
executive, that they are there to
say, you can’t do this or that. That

1720
00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:44.318
say, you can’t do this or that. That
is not acceptable because whatever

1721
00:51:44.318 --> 00:51:46.734
is not acceptable because whatever
you think of Priti Patel, she is the

1722
00:51:46.734 --> 00:51:48.484
you think of Priti Patel, she is the
elected representative of the

1723
00:51:48.484 --> 00:51:49.693
elected representative of the
people. The civil service is there

1724
00:51:49.693 --> 00:51:52.484
people. The civil service is there
to help her get get done what the

1725
00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:58.234
to help her get get done what the
people have voted to do.

1726
00:52:00.276 --> 00:52:01.901
people have voted to do. Our civil
service are better and more

1727
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:03.109
service are better and more
professional at doing that than

1728
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:05.234
professional at doing that than
almost any other civil service in

1729
00:52:05.234 --> 00:52:07.234
almost any other civil service in
the world, and respected across the

1730
00:52:07.234 --> 00:52:12.234
the world, and respected across the
world.

1731
00:52:12.276 --> 00:52:14.234
world. And the New Labour, at least

1732
00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:14.693
world. And the New labour, at least
one Home

1733
00:52:14.693 --> 00:52:15.318
world. And the New Labour, at least
one Home Secretary described the

1734
00:52:15.318 --> 00:52:17.026
one Home Secretary described the
civil service is not fit for

1735
00:52:17.026 --> 00:52:21.734
civil service is not fit for
purpose. When you have a radical

1736
00:52:21.734 --> 00:52:21.901
purpose. when you have a radical
government,

1737
00:52:21.901 --> 00:52:22.943
purpose. When you have a radical
government, you always get the civil

1738
00:52:22.943 --> 00:52:24.109
government, you always get the civil
service saying they don’t know what

1739
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:26.568
service saying they don’t know what
they are doing. The woman in the

1740
00:52:26.568 --> 00:52:31.901
they are doing. The woman in the
front? I was going to say, this lady

1741
00:52:31.901 --> 00:52:33.526
front? I was going to say, this lady
has had problems in three

1742
00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:35.109
has had problems in three
departments. They are allegations,

1743
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:37.193
departments. They are allegations,
you can’t come to a conclusion about

1744
00:52:37.193 --> 00:52:41.276
you can’t come to a conclusion about
that. She denies them. She also had

1745
00:52:41.276 --> 00:52:43.484
that. She denies them. She also had
to leave the government previously

1746
00:52:43.484 --> 00:52:45.109
to leave the government previously
because she was talking to the

1747
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:46.359
because she was talking to the
Israeli government or something like

1748
00:52:46.359 --> 00:52:50.526
Israeli government or something like
that. So it’s not the first time

1749
00:52:50.526 --> 00:52:51.068
that. So it’s not the first time
something has not

1750
00:52:51.068 --> 00:52:51.693
that. So it’s not the first time
something has notjust been an

1751
00:52:51.693 --> 00:52:53.026
something has not just been an
allegation.

1752
00:52:53.026 --> 00:52:54.401
something has notjust been an
allegation. The woman in the black

1753
00:52:54.401 --> 00:52:58.109
allegation. The woman in the black
and white top? Could it be that

1754
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:59.776
and white top? Could it be that
certain members of the civil service

1755
00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:02.484
certain members of the civil service
are using accusations of bullying to

1756
00:53:02.484 --> 00:53:06.776
are using accusations of bullying to
hide behind, when in fact, it may be

1757
00:53:06.776 --> 00:53:09.359
hide behind, when in fact, it may be
laziness, resistance to change or

1758
00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:10.693
laziness, resistance to change or
incompetence? And the man in the

1759
00:53:10.693 --> 00:53:13.276
incompetence? And the man in the
blue sweater? I wonder whether there

1760
00:53:13.276 --> 00:53:15.859
blue sweater? I wonder whether there
is an element of sexism. Her

1761
00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:16.943
is an element of sexism. Her
behaviour in a man

1762
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:18.151
is an element of sexism. Her
behaviour in a men might be seen as

1763
00:53:18.151 --> 00:53:19.651
behaviour in a man might be seen as
assertive, but in Priti Patel, it is

1764
00:53:19.651 --> 00:53:21.734
assertive, but in Priti Patel, it is
interpreted as being bullying. What

1765
00:53:21.734 --> 00:53:22.359
interpreted as being bullying. what
do the panel

1766
00:53:22.359 --> 00:53:26.193
interpreted as being bullying. What
do the panel think of that? Well,

1767
00:53:26.193 --> 00:53:29.109
do the panel think of that? Well,
first of all, I think we need a

1768
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:31.318
first of all, I think we need a
proper investigation into this that

1769
00:53:31.318 --> 00:53:36.609
proper investigation into this that
is actually independent.

1770
00:53:40.443 --> 00:53:42.318
is actually independent. As with
anyone who faces allegations like

1771
00:53:42.318 --> 00:53:43.776
anyone who faces allegations like
this at work, we would expect that

1772
00:53:43.776 --> 00:53:46.776
this at work, we would expect that
the right process is followed, but

1773
00:53:46.776 --> 00:53:48.693
the right process is followed, but
my concern is that that independent

1774
00:53:48.693 --> 00:53:50.734
my concern is that that independent
investigation is going to be done by

1775
00:53:50.734 --> 00:53:52.109
investigation is going to be done by
the Cabinet Office, and I don’t

1776
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:53.984
the Cabinet Office, and I don’t
think that that is very independent.

1777
00:53:53.984 --> 00:53:56.359
think that that is very independent.
It needs to be properly independent.

1778
00:53:56.359 --> 00:53:56.484
It needs to be property independent.
But

1779
00:53:56.484 --> 00:53:58.651
It needs to be properly independent.
But what it does speak to in my

1780
00:53:58.651 --> 00:54:00.734
But what it does speak to in my
view, and let’s leave Priti Patel to

1781
00:54:00.734 --> 00:54:03.693
view, and let’s leave Priti Patel to
one side because there is a broader

1782
00:54:03.693 --> 00:54:04.693
one side because there is a broader
bullying culture that is emanating

1783
00:54:04.693 --> 00:54:07.693
bullying culture that is emanating
from Number Ten. We have seen

1784
00:54:07.693 --> 00:54:11.109
from Number Ten. We have seen
Dominic Cummings firing large

1785
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:14.151
Dominic Cummings firing large
numbers of special advisers. My

1786
00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:15.526
numbers of special advisers. My
understanding is that one of them is

1787
00:54:15.526 --> 00:54:17.151
understanding is that one of them is
suing Number Ten for wrongful

1788
00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:22.484
suing Number Ten for wrongful
dismissal. And I believe that

1789
00:54:22.484 --> 00:54:24.151
dismissal. And I believe that
obviously, bullying and harassment

1790
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.109
obviously, bullying and harassment
have no place in any organisation.

1791
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:27.943
have no place in any organisation.
Number Ten should not be exempt from

1792
00:54:27.943 --> 00:54:31.443
Number Ten should not be exempt from
that. But you also set the tone from

1793
00:54:31.443 --> 00:54:34.318
that. But you also set the tone from
government. You set the tone not

1794
00:54:34.318 --> 00:54:35.943
government. You set the tone not
just for the civil service, but the

1795
00:54:35.943 --> 00:54:37.734
just for the civil service, but the
whole of the country. We have been

1796
00:54:37.734 --> 00:54:40.318
whole of the country. We have been
talking today about compassion and

1797
00:54:40.318 --> 00:54:41.901
talking today about compassion and
pulling together and wouldn’t it be

1798
00:54:41.901 --> 00:54:44.068
pulling together and wouldn’t it be
wonderful if we were nicer to each

1799
00:54:44.068 --> 00:54:45.484
wonderful if we were nicer to each
other? Well, I’m sorry to say that

1800
00:54:45.484 --> 00:54:46.901
other? Well, I’m sorry to say that
also applies to the way people treat

1801
00:54:46.901 --> 00:54:49.943
also applies to the way people treat
each other in government, in

1802
00:54:49.943 --> 00:54:50.151
each other in government, in
partiament

1803
00:54:50.151 --> 00:54:51.859
each other in government, in
parliament and in our institutions

1804
00:54:51.859 --> 00:54:52.109
partiament and in our institutions
because

1805
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:54.151
parliament and in our institutions
because it matters and it filters

1806
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:56.901
because it matters and it filters
into society. If we are serious

1807
00:54:56.901 --> 00:54:59.651
into society. If we are serious
about that, we should be worried and

1808
00:54:59.651 --> 00:55:00.943
about that, we should be worried and
take these allegations against Priti

1809
00:55:00.943 --> 00:55:03.276
take these allegations against Priti
Patel and others in government very

1810
00:55:03.276 --> 00:55:05.109
Patel and others in government very
seriously. We deserve better than

1811
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:11.943
seriously. We deserve better than
them. Xand.

1812
00:55:12.693 --> 00:55:17.484
them. Xand. I couldn’t agree more
with layla. You

1813
00:55:17.484 --> 00:55:18.693
them. Xand. I couldn’t agree more
with Layla. You raise the issue of

1814
00:55:18.693 --> 00:55:18.943
with layla. You raise the issue of
sexism.

1815
00:55:18.943 --> 00:55:20.651
with Layla. You raise the issue of
sexism. One thing that does concern

1816
00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:21.984
sexism. One thing that does concern
me in the conversation about Priti

1817
00:55:21.984 --> 00:55:23.693
me in the conversation about Priti
Patel, she is too many people on the

1818
00:55:23.693 --> 00:55:25.776
Patel, she is too many people on the
left one of the least likeable

1819
00:55:25.776 --> 00:55:27.651
left one of the least likeable
members of the Cabinet. Her support

1820
00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:28.901
members of the Cabinet. Her support
for the death penalty, 3

1821
00:55:28.901 --> 00:55:29.526
members of the Cabinet. Her support
for the death penalty, a wavering

1822
00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.484
for the death penalty, a wavering
support for the death penalty, the

1823
00:55:31.484 --> 00:55:32.901
support for the death penalty, the
overall agenda of the Home Office

1824
00:55:32.901 --> 00:55:35.068
overall agenda of the Home Office
seems particularly efficient and

1825
00:55:35.068 --> 00:55:35.984
seems particularly efficient and
unpleasant. So there is a

1826
00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:39.276
seems particularly efficient and
unpleasant. So there is atone ——

1827
00:55:39.276 --> 00:55:39.734
unpleasant. So there is a tone --
the agenda

1828
00:55:39.734 --> 00:55:40.484
unpleasant. So there is atone ——
the agenda seems vicious, so there

1829
00:55:40.484 --> 00:55:42.693
the agenda seems vicious, so there
is a tone

1830
00:55:42.693 --> 00:55:43.818
the agenda seems vicious, so there
is atone which seems equally

1831
00:55:43.818 --> 00:55:45.359
is a tone which seems equally
unpleasant. In general, the

1832
00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:46.693
unpleasant. In general, the
nastiness of the rhetoric around the

1833
00:55:46.693 --> 00:55:50.068
nastiness of the rhetoric around the
party political positions on social

1834
00:55:50.068 --> 00:55:51.984
party political positions on social
media does trickle down. I work a

1835
00:55:51.984 --> 00:55:52.693
media does trickla down. I work a
lot with

1836
00:55:52.693 --> 00:55:53.526
media does trickle down. I work a
lot with schools and film with

1837
00:55:53.526 --> 00:55:55.276
lot with schools and film with
children and we are seeing a rise in

1838
00:55:55.276 --> 00:55:57.651
children and we are seeing a rise in
bullying and a rise in nastiness.

1839
00:55:57.651 --> 00:56:00.359
bullying and a rise in nastiness.
Coming out of Number Ten for sure,

1840
00:56:00.359 --> 00:56:02.568
Coming out of Number Ten for sure,
but also coming out of an adult

1841
00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:06.484
but also coming out of an adult
class that is increasingly divided.

1842
00:56:06.484 --> 00:56:07.901
class that is increasingly divided.
So in exposing concern about Priti

1843
00:56:07.901 --> 00:56:10.068
So in exposing concern about Priti
Patel, of course there should be an

1844
00:56:10.068 --> 00:56:11.359
Patel, of course there should be an
investigation. It is also important

1845
00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:11.693
investigation. It is also important
that peopla

1846
00:56:11.693 --> 00:56:13.776
investigation. It is also important
that people who don’t like her and

1847
00:56:13.776 --> 00:56:13.859
that peopla who don’t like her and
are

1848
00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:15.359
that people who don’t like her and
are concerned about these

1849
00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:16.484
are concerned about these
allegations do not then adopt that

1850
00:56:16.484 --> 00:56:18.484
allegations do not then adopt that
tone themselves. Has her position

1851
00:56:18.484 --> 00:56:22.484
tone themselves. Has her position
become untenable? I am not in the

1852
00:56:22.484 --> 00:56:22.818
become untenabla? I am not in the
Home Office,

1853
00:56:22.818 --> 00:56:24.901
become untenable? I am not in the
Home Office, so until there is an

1854
00:56:24.901 --> 00:56:26.401
Home Office, so until there is an
investigation, it is impossible to

1855
00:56:26.401 --> 00:56:28.026
investigation, it is impossible to
say, but it is concerning. Let’s

1856
00:56:28.026 --> 00:56:30.943
say, but it is concerning. Let’s
talk about this investigation in a

1857
00:56:30.943 --> 00:56:32.818
talk about this investigation in a
moment. Given what has been set on

1858
00:56:32.818 --> 00:56:34.484
moment. Given what has been set on
the panel here and given the

1859
00:56:34.484 --> 00:56:35.984
the panel here and given the
allegations about Priti Patel going

1860
00:56:35.984 --> 00:56:38.068
allegations about Priti Patel going
back five years, when did you first

1861
00:56:38.068 --> 00:56:41.859
back five years, when did you first
hear concerns about her behaviour?

1862
00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:42.234
hear concerns about her behaviour?
when I

1863
00:56:42.234 --> 00:56:44.443
hear concerns about her behaviour?
When I turned on my TV on a Saturday

1864
00:56:44.443 --> 00:56:45.109
when I turned on my TV on a Saturday
and saw the

1865
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.943
When I turned on my TV on a Saturday
and saw the resignation of one of

1866
00:56:45.943 --> 00:56:47.318
and saw the resignation of one of
the civil servants. In the Home

1867
00:56:47.318 --> 00:56:51.943
the civil servants. In the Home
Office? 50 nothing was heard by you

1868
00:56:51.943 --> 00:56:55.484
Office? So nothing was heard by you
prior to that? Absolutely not. I

1869
00:56:55.484 --> 00:56:57.651
prior to that? Absolutely not. I
know Priti Patel well. I have worked

1870
00:56:57.651 --> 00:57:00.984
know Priti Patel well. I have worked
with her a lot. She is determined.

1871
00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.484
with her a lot. She is determined.
She certainly wants to get her

1872
00:57:03.484 --> 00:57:05.276
She certainly wants to get her
agenda through and that is what we

1873
00:57:05.276 --> 00:57:09.484
agenda through and that is what we
want in a Home Secretary. In my

1874
00:57:09.484 --> 00:57:10.484
want in a Home Secretary. In my
experience, and all the

1875
00:57:10.484 --> 00:57:11.401
experience, and all the
conversations and dealings I have

1876
00:57:11.401 --> 00:57:14.234
conversations and dealings I have
had with her and her team, she has

1877
00:57:14.234 --> 00:57:17.276
had with her and her team, she has
always been courteous, polite and

1878
00:57:17.276 --> 00:57:18.109
always been courteous, polite and
straightforward. So were you

1879
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:19.984
straightforward. So were you
surprised by the allegations, and so

1880
00:57:19.984 --> 00:57:26.068
surprised by the allegations, and so
many of them? Yes, I am. It is vital

1881
00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:30.109
many of them? Yes, I am. It is vital
that we have an investigation. That

1882
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:31.943
that we have an investigation. That
is under way. It has Alex Allan, who

1883
00:57:31.943 --> 00:57:35.068
is under way. It has Alex Allan, who
is independent. Is that into the

1884
00:57:35.068 --> 00:57:35.859
is independent. Is that into the
allegations from all three

1885
00:57:35.859 --> 00:57:39.359
allegations from all three
departments? It is into all of the

1886
00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:44.151
departments? It is into all of the
facts. I don’t think we should be

1887
00:57:44.151 --> 00:57:45.984
facts. I don’t think we should be
jumping to conclusions before we

1888
00:57:45.984 --> 00:57:51.109
jumping to conclusions before we
have the facts. I think the agenda

1889
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:54.901
have the facts. I think the agenda
that Priti is pursuing is probably

1890
00:57:54.901 --> 00:57:56.484
that Priti is pursuing is probably
closer to the views of the British

1891
00:57:56.484 --> 00:57:58.234
closer to the views of the British
people and home affairs in terms of

1892
00:57:58.234 --> 00:57:58.568
peopla and home affairs in terms of
putting in

1893
00:57:58.568 --> 00:58:00.943
people and home affairs in terms of
putting in place controls on

1894
00:58:00.943 --> 00:58:02.318
putting in place controls on
immigration and more police, than

1895
00:58:02.318 --> 00:58:04.151
immigration and more police, than
any Home Secretary for many decades.

1896
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:08.734
any Home Secretary for many decades.
And I support her in doing that. But

1897
00:58:08.734 --> 00:58:10.318
And I support her in doing that. But
Matt, today is World Book Day. One

1898
00:58:10.318 --> 00:58:15.943
Matt, today is World Book Day. One
of my favourite books is Harry

1899
00:58:15.943 --> 00:58:18.693
of my favourite books is Harry

use, if I were Priti Pateland I
were hearing

1915
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:36.943
case, if I were Priti Patel and I
were hearing these allegations, and

1916
00:58:36.943 --> 00:58:38.818
were hearing these allegations, and
you are hearing these as well, are

1917
00:58:38.818 --> 00:58:40.151
you are hearing these as well, are
you really so comfortable backing

1918
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:41.901
you really so comfortable backing
her to the hilt in the way you are?

1919
00:58:41.901 --> 00:58:46.484
her to the hilt in the way you are?
There are others who could drive

1920
00:58:46.484 --> 00:58:48.526
There are others who could drive
through the mandate that you want to

1921
00:58:48.526 --> 00:58:49.484
through the mandate that you want to
get through, and I completely

1922
00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:52.943
get through, and I completely
disagree with a lot of it. The Home

1923
00:58:52.943 --> 00:58:54.984
disagree with a lot of it. The Home
Office, by the way, in my

1924
00:58:54.984 --> 00:58:56.818
Office, by the way, in my
constituency surgery, that hostile

1925
00:58:56.818 --> 00:58:59.568
constituency surgery, that hostile
environment still exists. Windrush

1926
00:58:59.568 --> 00:59:00.401
environment still exists. windmsh
citizens

1927
00:59:00.401 --> 00:59:01.693
environment still exists. Windrush
citizens now, this is a department

1928
00:59:01.693 --> 00:59:02.484
citizens now, this is a department
that does desperately need

1929
00:59:02.484 --> 00:59:04.901
that does desperately need
leadership but needs a lot of

1930
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:06.818
leadership but needs a lot of
compassion and a lot of change, but

1931
00:59:06.818 --> 00:59:08.526
compassion and a lot of change, but
not in this direction. Are you

1932
00:59:08.526 --> 00:59:09.651
not in this direction. Are you
really that comfortable backing her

1933
00:59:09.651 --> 00:59:10.234
really that comfortable backing her
in

1934
00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:11.109
really that comfortable hacking her
in the way

1935
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:12.901
really that comfortable backing her
in the way that you are? I would

1936
00:59:12.901 --> 00:59:13.943
in the way that you are? I would
certainly be uncomfortable with

1937
00:59:13.943 --> 00:59:15.359
certainly be uncomfortable with
taking the position, as you seem to

1938
00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:18.109
taking the position, as you seem to
have done, of presuming her guilty

1939
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:24.109
have done, of presuming her guilty
before you have seen the facts.

1940
00:59:24.818 --> 00:59:28.943
before you have seen the facts. The
man in the checked shirt there? Do

1941
00:59:28.943 --> 00:59:32.318
man in the checked shirt there? Do
we really need a long, expensive,

1942
00:59:32.318 --> 00:59:32.859
we really need a long, expensive,
drawn—out independent investigation

1943
00:59:32.859 --> 00:59:33.484
drawn-out independent investigation
for

1944
00:59:33.484 --> 00:59:34.484
drawn—out independent investigation
for claims that she allegedly may

1945
00:59:34.484 --> 00:59:34.609
for claims that she allagedly may
have

1946
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:35.776
for claims that she allegedly may
have shouted at someone three or

1947
00:59:35.776 --> 00:59:39.318
have shouted at someone three or
four years ago? Because you think it

1948
00:59:39.318 --> 00:59:40.234
four years ago? Because you think it
doesn’t matter because you have

1949
00:59:40.234 --> 00:59:43.359
doesn’t matter because you have
already made your mind up? Not that

1950
00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:45.359
already made your mind up? Not that
it doesn’t matter, but there are

1951
00:59:45.359 --> 00:59:46.484
it doesn’t matter, but there are
more important issues we could be

1952
00:59:46.484 --> 00:59:48.109
more important issues we could be
looking at as opposed to someone

1953
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.401
looking at as opposed to someone
alloyedly

1954
00:59:48.401 --> 00:59:49.859
looking at as opposed to someone
allegedly shouting at someone. There

1955
00:59:49.859 --> 00:59:52.359
allegedly shouting at someone. There
are a lot of anti—Semitism claims in

1956
00:59:52.359 --> 00:59:53.193
are a lot of anti-Semitism claims in
the labour Party.

1957
00:59:53.193 --> 00:59:53.776
are a lot of anti—Semitism claims in
the Labour Party. That deserves an

1958
00:59:53.776 --> 00:59:53.984
the labour Party. That deserves an
independent

1959
00:59:53.984 --> 00:59:55.693
the Labour Party. That deserves an
independent investigation. It is

1960
00:59:55.693 --> 00:59:59.318
independent investigation. It is
being investigated by the Equality

1961
00:59:59.318 --> 01:00:00.401
being investigated by the Equality
and Human Rights Commission. Is that

1962
01:00:00.401 --> 01:00:02.276
and Human Rights Commission. Is that
the same as shouting at someone a

1963
01:00:02.276 --> 01:00:04.734
the same as shouting at someone a
few years ago? I am not sure it is.

1964
01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:08.734
few years ago? I am not sure it is.
The man in the glasses. What would

1965
01:00:08.734 --> 01:00:09.068
The man in the glasses. what would
the

1966
01:00:09.068 --> 01:00:10.318
The man in the glasses. What would
the consequences be if she were

1967
01:00:10.318 --> 01:00:12.651
the consequences be if she were
found guilty of the allegations?

1968
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.026
found guilty of the allegations?
Would she be expected to resign or

1969
01:00:14.026 --> 01:00:16.484
Would she be expected to resign or
would she retain her position? That

1970
01:00:16.484 --> 01:00:17.734
would she retain her position? That
is a matter for the

1971
01:00:17.734 --> 01:00:18.068
would she retain her position? That
is a matterfor the prime minister.

1972
01:00:18.068 --> 01:00:18.526
is a matter for the prime minister.
But we

1973
01:00:18.526 --> 01:00:20.234
is a matterfor the prime minister.
But we haven’t reached that because

1974
01:00:20.234 --> 01:00:22.484
But we haven’t reached that because
we want to get to the bottom of

1975
01:00:22.484 --> 01:00:24.526
we want to get to the bottom of
allegations. It is reasonable to

1976
01:00:24.526 --> 01:00:24.818
allagations. It is reasonabla to
investigate

1977
01:00:24.818 --> 01:00:26.026
allegations. It is reasonable to
investigate allegations. What is

1978
01:00:26.026 --> 01:00:27.026
investigate allegations. What is
unreasonable is people who disagree

1979
01:00:27.026 --> 01:00:30.026
unreasonable is people who disagree
with her policies saying she should

1980
01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.318
with her policies saying she should
be got rid of before that has even

1981
01:00:32.318 --> 01:00:34.484
be got rid of before that has even
happened. It is ironic that the Home

1982
01:00:34.484 --> 01:00:35.484
happened. It is ironic that the Home
Secretary is not getting due

1983
01:00:35.484 --> 01:00:37.693
Secretary is not getting due
justice. That doesn’t seem quite

1984
01:00:37.693 --> 01:00:42.609
justice. That doesn’t seem quite
fair.

1985
01:00:45.484 --> 01:00:49.359
fair. There is a presumption of
guilt in this conversation. I didn’t

1986
01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.859
guilt in this conversation. I didn’t
say that an Layla didn’t say that

1987
01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:51.234
say that an layla didn’t say that
either. I

1988
01:00:51.234 --> 01:00:51.401
say that an Layla didn’t say that
either. I said

1989
01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:51.651
say that an Layla didn’t say that
either. Isaid I

1990
01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:52.484
say that an Layla didn’t say that
either. I said I don’t know what is

1991
01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:56.109
either. I said I don’t know what is
happening in the Foreign Office ——

1992
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.276
happening in the Foreign Office --
Home

1993
01:00:56.276 --> 01:00:57.318
happening in the Foreign Office ——
Home Office, but it’s important to

1994
01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:58.318
Home Office, but it’s important to
investigate and it’s important that

1995
01:00:58.318 --> 01:01:00.484
investigate and it’s important that
we do not create a culture of

1996
01:01:00.484 --> 01:01:01.526
we do not create a culture of
bullying against Priti Patel, no

1997
01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:04.359
bullying against Priti Patel, no
matter what we think of some of her

1998
01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:05.526
matter what we think of some of her
odious policies. I was very clear

1999
01:01:05.526 --> 01:01:11.234
odious policies. I was very clear
about that. Let me hear more from

2000
01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:14.693
about that. Let me hear more from
the audience. Given the number of

2001
01:01:14.693 --> 01:01:15.651
the audience. Given the number of
senior ministers who have already

2002
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:20.026
senior ministers who have already
shown their support for Priti Patel,

2003
01:01:20.026 --> 01:01:21.109
shown their support for Priti Patel,
is a ministerial investigation then

2004
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.276
is a ministerial investigation then
tmly

2005
01:01:21.276 --> 01:01:26.693
is a ministerial investigation then
truly independent? It isn’t a

2006
01:01:26.693 --> 01:01:27.818
truly independent? It isn’t a
ministerial investigation, it’s an

2007
01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.234
ministerial investigation, it’s an
investigation by the Cabinet Office

2008
01:01:29.234 --> 01:01:32.443
investigation by the Cabinet Office
with the independent adviser to the

2009
01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:35.984
with the independent adviser to the
Cabinet Office, so Alex Allan. And

2010
01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.359
Cabinet Office, so Alex Allan. And
let that investigation go ahead.

2011
01:01:38.359 --> 01:01:39.401
let that investigation go ahead.
Imagine an alternative scenario,

2012
01:01:39.401 --> 01:01:41.026
Imagine an alternative scenario,
which is simply the allegations are

2013
01:01:41.026 --> 01:01:42.109
which is simply the allegations are
made and the prime minister

2014
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:44.109
made and the prime minister
immediately dropped her. That would

2015
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:45.359
immediately dropped her. That would
set a dreadful president at the

2016
01:01:45.359 --> 01:01:46.818
set a dreadful president at the
beginning of this government. The

2017
01:01:46.818 --> 01:01:48.443
beginning of this government. The
message it would send to the civil

2018
01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:51.318
message it would send to the civil
service is, if you don’t like

2019
01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:52.359
service is, if you don’t like
policies of your senior minister,

2020
01:01:52.359 --> 01:01:54.359
policies of your senior minister,
make a complaint and get rid of

2021
01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:55.943
make a complaint and get rid of
them. Hold on, you are saying that

2022
01:01:55.943 --> 01:01:57.109
them. Hold on, you are saying that
these civil servants don’t like the

2023
01:01:57.109 --> 01:02:00.109
these civil servants don’t like the
policies. How do you know that? You

2024
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:03.276
policies. How do you know that? You
can’t know that. This is why an

2025
01:02:03.276 --> 01:02:04.318
can’t know that. This is why an
investigation is so important. The

2026
01:02:04.318 --> 01:02:07.318
investigation is so important. The
question I was asking is, why is

2027
01:02:07.318 --> 01:02:07.609
question I was asking is, why is
Boris

2028
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:08.693
question I was asking is, why is
BorisJohnson and you so comfortable

2029
01:02:08.693 --> 01:02:09.276
Boris johnson and you so comfortable
backing her to

2030
01:02:09.276 --> 01:02:10.318
BorisJohnson and you so comfortable
backing her to the hilt in the way

2031
01:02:10.318 --> 01:02:13.026
hacking her to the hilt in the way
that you are?

2032
01:02:13.026 --> 01:02:14.109
backing her to the hilt in the way
that you are? Let’s put it to an

2033
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:18.151
that you are? Let’s put it to an
investigation. Why go and say she is

2034
01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:18.318
investigation. why go and say she is
wonderful,

2035
01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:22.068
investigation. Why go and say she is
wonderful, she has always been

2036
01:02:22.068 --> 01:02:23.734
wonderful, she has always been
lovely to me? So she supposed to go

2037
01:02:23.734 --> 01:02:25.359
lovely to me? So she supposed to go
into purdah for the next six months

2038
01:02:25.359 --> 01:02:27.901
into purdah for the next six months
and hide from the public during the

2039
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.484
and hide from the public during the
investigation? She has to her

2040
01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:30.859
and hide from the public during the
investigation? She has to herjob.

2041
01:02:30.859 --> 01:02:31.401
investigation? She has to her job.
But ran

2042
01:02:31.401 --> 01:02:32.193
investigation? She has to herjob.
But can we stop suggesting that

2043
01:02:32.193 --> 01:02:34.359
But ran we stop suggesting that
civil

2044
01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:35.901
But can we stop suggesting that
civil servants are somehow

2045
01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:36.734
civil servants are somehow
constructing some kind of

2046
01:02:36.734 --> 01:02:38.109
constructing some kind of
conspiracy? We have spent the first

2047
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:40.526
conspiracy? We have spent the first
part of this programme talking about

2048
01:02:40.526 --> 01:02:42.068
part of this programme talking about
how we need to treat each other with

2049
01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:44.734
how we need to treat each other with
respect and listen to experts. There

2050
01:02:44.734 --> 01:02:46.693
respect and listen to experts. There
are many expert people in the civil

2051
01:02:46.693 --> 01:02:49.359
are many expert people in the civil
service who are well worth listening

2052
01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:53.943
service who are well worth listening
to and deserve our respect. We are

2053
01:02:53.943 --> 01:02:58.693
to and deserve our respect. We are
almost out of time. It is vital in

2054
01:02:58.693 --> 01:02:59.984
almost out of time. It is vital in
this country that people are

2055
01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:03.484
this country that people are
innocent and not resumed guilty

2056
01:03:03.484 --> 01:03:05.776
innocent and not resumed guilty
until the facts are established. But

2057
01:03:05.776 --> 01:03:10.776
until the facts are established. But
the final thing that is so critical

2058
01:03:10.776 --> 01:03:12.693
the final thing that is so critical
is that civil servants, medics, the

2059
01:03:12.693 --> 01:03:13.109
is that civil servants, media, the
NHS and

2060
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:16.068
is that civil servants, medics, the
NHS and ministers work together

2061
01:03:16.068 --> 01:03:18.026
NHS and ministers work together
closely on this great crisis of

2062
01:03:18.026 --> 01:03:19.526
closely on this great crisis of
coronavirus that we were talking

2063
01:03:19.526 --> 01:03:24.484
coronavirus that we were talking
about for most of the programme. It

2064
01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:26.443
about for most of the programme. It
shows that this is a completely

2065
01:03:26.443 --> 01:03:28.109
shows that this is a completely
separate question. The way that

2066
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:29.401
separate question. The way that
ministers and civil servants can and

2067
01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:29.734
ministers and civil servants ran and
do work

2068
01:03:29.734 --> 01:03:32.359
ministers and civil servants can and
do work together across government

2069
01:03:32.359 --> 01:03:34.276
do work together across government
has just been shown in exemplary

2070
01:03:34.276 --> 01:03:38.401
has just been shown in exemplary
fashion on the coronavirus issue and

2071
01:03:38.401 --> 01:03:38.568
fashion on the coronavirus issue and
is

2072
01:03:38.568 --> 01:03:39.484
fashion on the coronavims issue and
is continuing

2073
01:03:39.484 --> 01:03:40.276
fashion on the coronavirus issue and
is continuing 24/7 to keep people

2074
01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:40.609

safe. I’m

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:43.484

safe. I’m afraid our time is up. The

2076
01:03:43.484 --> 01:03:45.151

agreement lasted quite a lot of the

2077
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:45.693
agreement lasted quite a lot of the
programme and then

2078
01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:45.859
agreement lasted quite a lot of the
programme and thenjust

2079
01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:46.026
agreement lasted quite a lot of the
programme and then just vanished,

2080
01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:48.401
programme and then just vanished,

It’s a lot of new faces
that need bedding in.

2102
01:04:49.776 --> 01:04:51.651
THEY SHOUT
It was your fault!

2103
01:04:51.651 --> 01:04:53.026
They’re targeting the hospital.

2104
01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:54.901
They think it was the local warlord.

2105
01:04:56.068 --> 01:04:58.568
My fiance was killed
on a mission to get Omar.

2106
01:04:58.568 --> 01:05:02.401
The same warlord who killed
your husband is now targeting you.

2107
01:05:02.401 --> 01:05:05.401
# Oh, I let my lover go

2108

# Didn’t wanna be a liar

# Now I’m running toward the fire

2111
01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:16.734
# Runnin’ toward,
runnin’ toward the fire... #

2112

Just keep being reminded of Elvis.
