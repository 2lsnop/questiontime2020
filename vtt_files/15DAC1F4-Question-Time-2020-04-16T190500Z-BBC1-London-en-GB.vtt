Good evening. My question is this.

63
00:02:52.314 --> 00:02:57.356
Good evening. My question is this.
The mark of a civilised society is

64
00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:59.856
The mark of a civilised society is
how it provides for its most

65
00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:01.022
how it provides for its most
vulnerable members. How many marks

66
00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:07.772
vulnerable members. How many marks
out of ten with the panel give to

67
00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:09.606
out of ten with the panel give to
this country for its record on

68
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.856
this country for its record on
social care. 50 how many marks out

69
00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:13.439
social rare. So how many marks out
of ten? Rachel,

70
00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.272
social care. 50 how many marks out
of ten? Rachel, since this is your

71
00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:19.189
of ten? Rachel, since this is your
area? Absolutely. In answer to this

72
00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.272
area? Absolutely. In answer to this
question I ran

73
00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:23.314
area? Absolutely. In answer to this
question I can say that I am seeing

74
00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:25.231
question I ran say that I am seeing
right now,

75
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:26.022
question I can say that I am seeing
right now, precisely on the front

76
00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:27.814
right now, precisely on the front
line, exactly the esteem in which we

77
00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:30.314
line, exactly the esteem in which we
hold our most vulnerable members of

78
00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:32.439
hold our most vulnerable members of
society. Of course, people in care

79
00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.564
society. Of course, peopla in rare
homes are

80
00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:38.606
homes are predominantly elderly

81
00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:38.772
homes are predominantly elderty
citizens,

82
00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:40.397
homes are predominantly elderly
citizens, sometimes young citizens

83
00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:44.439
citizens, sometimes young citizens
who are disabled as well. We know

84
00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.397
who are disabled as well. We know
these individuals, historically, not

85
00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:48.522
these individuals, historically, not
just for the last ten years, but for

86
00:03:48.522 --> 00:03:50.647
just for the last ten years, but for
the last couple of decades across

87
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.064
the last couple of decades across
both political parties have been

88
00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:56.897
both political parties have been
some of the most marginalised,

89
00:03:56.897 --> 00:03:58.397
some of the most marginalised,
neglacted,

90
00:03:58.397 --> 00:04:00.397
some of the most marginalised,
neglected, abandoned and diminished

91
00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:03.189
neglected, abandoned and diminished
members of our society. Successive

92
00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:04.439
members of our society. Successive
governments, both Labour and

93
00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.897
governments, both Labour and
Conservative I have to say, although

94
00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:09.356
Conservative I have to say, although
in the last ten years under the

95
00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:13.147
in the last ten years under the
guise of austerity, these have been

96
00:04:13.147 --> 00:04:13.647
guise of austerity, these have been
Conservative governments, have

97
00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:17.606
Conservative governments, have
prevaricated, talked the talk about

98
00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:17.814
prevarirated, talked the talk about
addressing

99
00:04:17.814 --> 00:04:18.231
prevaricated, talked the talk about
addressing the grotesque

100
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:19.606
addressing the grotesque
underfunding of our social care

101
00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:19.897
underfunding of our social rare
sector

102
00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:23.689
underfunding of our social care
sector while failing to deliver.

103
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.814
sector while failing to deliver.
There have been 17 White papers,

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:27.356
There have been 17 white papers,
green papers

105
00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:28.189
There have been 17 White papers,
green papers and national state

106
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.814
green papers and national state
reviews into the funding of our

107
00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:33.189
reviews into the funding of our
social care sector in the last 20

108
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.814
social rare sector in the last 20
years and

109
00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:35.939
social care sector in the last 20
years and precisely no action. 50

110
00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:36.356
years and precisely no action. So
now, we

111
00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:37.814
years and precisely no action. 50
now, we have a sector we

112
00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:38.356
years and precisely no action. So
now, we have a sector we know is

113
00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:39.981
now, we have a sector we know is
raring for

114
00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:41.397
now, we have a sector we know is
caring for society’s most vulnerable

115
00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.147
caring for society’s most vulnerable
members and yet it has been run down

116
00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:44.772
members and yet it has been mn down
and under

117
00:04:44.772 --> 00:04:45.814
members and yet it has been run down
and underfunded into an

118
00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:46.272
members and yet it has been run down
and under funded into an absolute

119
00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:49.981
and under funded into an absolute
travesty of what it should be. You

120
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:52.022
travesty of what it should be. You
have that as the background into

121
00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:55.314
have that as the background into
which inserts itself a virus that we

122
00:04:55.314 --> 00:04:57.772
which inserts itself a virus that we
know from China and Italy

123
00:04:57.772 --> 00:04:58.606
know from China and Italy
particularly, affects these

124
00:04:58.606 --> 00:04:59.897
particularly, affects these
vulnerable, elderly members of

125
00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:00.689
vulnerable, elderty members of
society more

126
00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.397
vulnerable, elderly members of
society more than anyone else. The

127
00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:04.356
society more than anyone else. The
death rate soars once you get into

128
00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:07.356
death rate soars once you get into
people in the 705 and 805. How do

129
00:05:07.356 --> 00:05:08.231
peopla in the 705 and 805. How do
you think the

130
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:08.606
people in the 705 and 805. How do
you think the government has

131
00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.856
you think the government has
responded to that when it comes to

132
00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:12.064
responded to that when it comes to
rare

133
00:05:12.064 --> 00:05:16.814
responded to that when it comes to
care homes? Absolutely inadequate

134
00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:17.606
rare homes? Absolutely inadequate
woefully, I

135
00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:20.356
care homes? Absolutely inadequate
woefully, I am afraid. They need to

136
00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:25.564
woefully, I am afraid. They need to
change the

137
00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:28.814
change the testing policy when only
people in hospital were being tested

138
00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:31.647
people in hospital were being tested
was the point at which people in

139
00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:31.814
was the point at which peopla in
rare

140
00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:32.939
was the point at which people in
care homes and people receiving care

141
00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:33.439
rare homes and people receiving rare
in their

142
00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.189
care homes and people receiving care
in their own homes were thrown under

143
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.564
in their own homes were thrown under
a bus, they were abandoned. And so

144
00:05:37.564 --> 00:05:38.856
a bus, they were abandoned. And so
were the absolutely extraordinary

145
00:05:38.856 --> 00:05:41.689
were the absolutely extraordinary
men and women who are carers

146
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.064
men and women who are carers
themselves. We are meant to have

147
00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.772
themselves. We are meant to have
parity in this country, we are meant

148
00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:48.231
parity in this country, we are meant
to have a department that is the

149
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:49.606
to have a department that is the
Department of Health and social

150
00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:50.439
Department of Health and social
rare, yet the

151
00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.897
Department of Health and social
care, yet the social side of that

152
00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:54.439
rare, yet the social side of that
department

153
00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.022
care, yet the social side of that
department is the Cinderella

154
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:58.314
department is the Cinderella
service. We have 122,000 vacancies

155
00:05:58.314 --> 00:05:59.647
service. We have 122,000 vacancies
in the rare

156
00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:00.939
service. We have 122,000 vacancies
in the care sector. Many carers are

157
00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:01.397
in the rare sector. Many carers are
paid the

158
00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:03.856
in the care sector. Many carers are
paid the minimum wage, they are

159
00:06:03.856 --> 00:06:06.939
paid the minimum wage, they are
treated without respect. Yesterday

160

treated without respect. Yesterday

161
00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:11.022
the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock,
tried to address that by offering

162
00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:13.231
tried to address that by offering
them a badge. We have had are

163
00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:15.439
them a badge. We have had are
commenting about the badge. Let me

164
00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.814
commenting about the badge. Let me
just find it. Please explain why a

165
00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:20.814
just find it. Please explain why a
badge is supposed to make a real

166
00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.897
badge is supposed to make a real
difference to me and my colleagues

167
00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:25.064
difference to me and my colleagues
in the fight against Covid—19 when

168
00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:25.897
in the fight against Covid-19 when
we

169
00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:29.106
in the fight against Covid—19 when
we need PPE and testing. Robert, you

170
00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:32.856
we need PPE and testing. Robert, you
have heard the directors saying it

171
00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:34.189
have heard the directors saying it
is shambolic, haphazard and paltry.

172
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:35.606
is shambolic, haphazard and paltry.
There has been a huge amount of

173
00:06:35.606 --> 00:06:37.397
There has been a huge amount of
criticism in the way the government

174
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.522
criticism in the way the government
has handled the social sector when

175
00:06:39.522 --> 00:06:42.564
has handled the social sector when
it comes to coronavirus, what Marx

176
00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:43.606
it comes to coronavims, what Marx
would you give

177
00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:44.272
it comes to coronavirus, what Marx
would you give the government on

178
00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:46.606
would you give the government on
that? Marks out of ten are difficult

179
00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.606
that? Marks out of ten are difficult
to assess at the moment. I am not

180
00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:51.731
to assess at the moment. I am not
going to pretend everything in the

181
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:54.022
going to pretend everything in the
garden is lovely because a lot of us

182
00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.272
garden is lovely because a lot of us
have relatives and friends we know

183
00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:56.356
have relatives and friends we know
in rare

184
00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:58.064
have relatives and friends we know
in care homes who are getting

185
00:06:58.064 --> 00:06:58.314
in rare homes who are getting
outstanding

186
00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:00.522
in care homes who are getting
outstanding treatment from carers

187
00:07:00.522 --> 00:07:02.022
outstanding treatment from carers
who work so hard and incredibly

188
00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:03.897
who work so hard and incredibly
hard. I think the badge is

189
00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:04.814
who work so hard and incredibly
hard. I think the badge isjust part

190
00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:05.147
hard. I think the badge is just part
of a

191
00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:06.731
hard. I think the badge isjust part
of a sincere and genuine move, not

192
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:10.231
of a sincere and genuine move, not
just by the government but by the

193
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:10.814
just by the government but by the
rare system

194
00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:12.189
just by the government but by the
care system itself to seek and

195
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:13.731
rare system itself to seek and
improve the

196
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:14.356
care system itself to seek and
improve the recognition for care

197
00:07:14.356 --> 00:07:14.606
improve the recognition for rare
workers.

198
00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.439
improve the recognition for care
workers. But if you don’t want to

199
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.564
workers. But if you don’t want to
give an answer with marks out of

200
00:07:21.564 --> 00:07:24.814
give an answer with marks out of
ten, how would you rate, categorise,

201
00:07:24.814 --> 00:07:26.356
ten, how would you rate, categorise,
describe the government’s

202
00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:27.522
describe the government’s
performance in the coronavirus

203
00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:29.814
performance in the coronavirus
crisis when it comes to social care

204
00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:32.397
crisis when it comes to social care
so far? I would say a lot more to

205
00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:32.772
so far? I would say a lot more to
do. which

206
00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:32.981
so far? I would say a lot more to
do. Which is

207
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:33.189
so far? I would say a lot more to
do. which is why

208
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:36.606
so far? I would say a lot more to
do. Which is why this announcement

209
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:37.897
do. which is why this announcement
by Matt

210
00:07:37.897 --> 00:07:38.439
do. Which is why this announcement
by Matt Hancock yesterday was

211
00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.189
by Matt Hancock yesterday was
welcome. The testing that is

212
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:43.439
welcome. The testing that is
required, the treatment we are

213
00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:45.481
required, the treatment we are
embarking on for extra care workers

214
00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:46.022
embarking on for extra rare workers
and the genuine

215
00:07:46.022 --> 00:07:47.064
embarking on for extra care workers
and the genuine push by government

216
00:07:47.064 --> 00:07:49.731
and the genuine push by government
to deal with, what is a very

217
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:52.689
to deal with, what is a very
vulnerable sector. I think it is

218
00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:54.522
vulnerable sector. I think it is
right to talk about the particular

219
00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:54.856
right to talk about the particular
challanges

220
00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:57.772
right to talk about the particular
challenges in care homes. We want to

221
00:07:57.772 --> 00:07:58.272
challanges in rare homes. We want to
see that

222
00:07:58.272 --> 00:07:59.647
challenges in care homes. We want to
see that infection rate reduced

223
00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:02.397
see that infection rate reduced
within our care homes. Because if we

224
00:08:02.397 --> 00:08:02.564
within our rare homes. Because if we
don’t

225
00:08:02.564 --> 00:08:04.522
within our care homes. Because if we
don’t reduce it there, indeed of the

226
00:08:04.522 --> 00:08:05.772
don’t reduce it there, indeed of the
vulnerable part of our society, we

227
00:08:05.772 --> 00:08:07.564
vulnerable part of our society, we
are not going to get the overall

228
00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:10.189
are not going to get the overall
rate down. That is so important in

229
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.272
rate down. That is so important in
dealing with this crisis. Lisa, the

230
00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:13.772
dealing with this crisis. Lisa, the
question is how many marks out of

231
00:08:13.772 --> 00:08:16.689
question is how many marks out of
ten should the government receive

232
00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:19.022
ten should the government receive
for its treatment of social care in

233
00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:19.314
for its treatment of social rare in
this

234
00:08:19.314 --> 00:08:21.147
for its treatment of social care in
this current crisis? I don’t want to

235
00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:23.981
this current crisis? I don’t want to
get into scoring the government out

236
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:25.772
get into scoring the government out
of ten. In the Labour leadership

237
00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:25.856
of ten. In the labour leadership
contest

238
00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:27.939
of ten. In the Labour leadership
contest we were all asked to score

239
00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:29.939
contest we were all asked to score
each other out of ten and it doesn’t

240
00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:31.606
each other out of ten and it doesn’t
get as anywhere as a country. The

241
00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:34.564
get as anywhere as a country. The
thing I want to see the government

242
00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:36.356
thing I want to see the government
do now is recognise, as I think Matt

243
00:08:36.356 --> 00:08:38.689
do now is recognise, as I think Matt
Hancock has, they have been too slow

244
00:08:38.689 --> 00:08:40.564
Hancock has, they have been too slow
to understand the crisis in emerging

245
00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:41.772
to understand the crisis in emerging
in our rare

246
00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:42.606
to understand the crisis in emerging
in our care homes and just take

247
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:42.981
in our rare homes and just take
action to

248
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.856
in our care homes and just take
action to deal with it. There was a

249
00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:46.606
action to deal with it. There was a
commitment early on the NHS would

250
00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:47.106
commitment earty on the NHS would
get all the

251
00:08:47.106 --> 00:08:48.314
commitment early on the NHS would
get all the resources it needs to

252
00:08:48.314 --> 00:08:50.564
get all the resources it needs to
deal with this crisis. The same

253
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:53.314
deal with this crisis. The same
commitment should surely be made to

254
00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:54.064
commitment should surely be made to
social rare

255
00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:56.231
commitment should surely be made to
social care as well. It is important

256
00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:56.439
social rare as well. It is important
the

257
00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:57.522
social care as well. It is important
the government starts producing

258
00:08:57.522 --> 00:08:59.231
the government starts producing
daily statistics about deaths in

259
00:08:59.231 --> 00:08:59.439
daily statistis about deaths in
rare

260
00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:01.189
daily statistics about deaths in
care homes, because we need to track

261
00:09:01.189 --> 00:09:01.481
rare homes, because we need to track
this,

262
00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:02.606
care homes, because we need to track
this, understand where the problem

263
00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:06.689
this, understand where the problem
is and what more we need to be doing

264
00:09:06.689 --> 00:09:09.064
is and what more we need to be doing
to tackle it. We need to roll out

265
00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:11.772
to tackle it. We need to roll out
testing to the social care sector. I

266
00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:13.106
testing to the social care sector. I
welcome the fact the government has

267
00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:15.147
welcome the fact the government has
said they will now do this and has

268
00:09:15.147 --> 00:09:17.522
said they will now do this and has
started to do this but we have 1.2

269
00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:18.314
started to do this but we have 1.2
million peopla

270
00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:19.564
started to do this but we have 1.2
million people who work in our

271
00:09:19.564 --> 00:09:19.731
million peopla who work in our
social

272
00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:21.606
million people who work in our
social care sector and as of

273
00:09:21.606 --> 00:09:21.856
social rare sector and as of
yesterday,

274
00:09:21.856 --> 00:09:23.397
social care sector and as of
yesterday, only around 500 tests had

275
00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:27.356
yesterday, only around 500 tests had
been carried out. The biggest issue

276
00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:30.356
been carried out. The biggest issue
I get from home carers, care home

277
00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:30.856
I get from home carers, rare home
workers

278
00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:33.814
I get from home carers, care home
workers here in Wigan is still this

279
00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:34.939

00:09:34.939 --> 00:09:35.814
workers here in Wigan is still this
question about PPE, personal

281
00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:37.397
question about PPE, personal
protective equipment. Last night,

282
00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:38.939
protective equipment. Last night,
one of those care home workers

283
00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:39.856
one of those rare home workers
messaged me

284
00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:41.814
one of those care home workers
messaged me to say she had been on

285
00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.522
messaged me to say she had been on
Amazon buying protective gear,

286
00:09:43.522 --> 00:09:45.897
Amazon buying protective gear,
because although they finally got

287
00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:47.814
because although they finally got
sent some masks, they are already

288
00:09:47.814 --> 00:09:49.397
sent some masks, they are already
mnning out. She

289
00:09:49.397 --> 00:09:50.356
sent some masks, they are already
running out. She said it is really,

290
00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.314
mnning out. She said it is really,
really hard to

291
00:09:51.314 --> 00:09:52.439
running out. She said it is really,
really hard to overstate how scared

292
00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:52.772
really hard to overstate how stared
people are.

293
00:09:52.772 --> 00:09:53.814
really hard to overstate how scared
people are. We are trying our best

294
00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:54.147
peopla are. We are trying our best
not to

295
00:09:54.147 --> 00:09:55.772
people are. We are trying our best
not to get this virus but we know it

296
00:09:55.772 --> 00:09:59.606
not to get this virus but we know it
is a question of when, not if. They

297
00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:01.439
is a question of when, not if. They
are working in small rooms where

298
00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:03.647
are working in small rooms where
they cannot socially distance and it

299
00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:05.856
they cannot socially distance and it
takes two people to move a person so

300
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.939
takes two people to move a person so
they cannot keep away from each

301
00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.689
they cannot keep away from each
other. I have one constituent who

302
00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:12.314
other. I have one constituent who
has a wife and young baby at home.

303
00:10:12.314 --> 00:10:13.397
has a wife and young baby at home.
He is not just

304
00:10:13.397 --> 00:10:14.022
has a wife and young baby at home.
He is notjust terrified about

305
00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:14.314
He is not just terrified about
getting it

306
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.897
He is notjust terrified about
getting it himself giving it to the

307
00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:17.606
getting it himself giving it to the
vulnerable people he is looking

308
00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:19.106
vulnerable people he is looking
after, he is terrified about what is

309
00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:21.481
after, he is terrified about what is
going to happen to his family as

310
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:23.314
going to happen to his family as
well. The worst thing about the

311
00:10:23.314 --> 00:10:25.356
well. The worst thing about the
message I got last night was a

312
00:10:25.356 --> 00:10:27.439
message I got last night was a
common theme, she said to me don’t

313
00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:31.231
common theme, she said to me don’t
reveal who I am because I would lose

314
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.689
reveal who I am because I would lose
my job. We have

315
00:10:34.689 --> 00:10:34.939
reveal who I am because I would lose
myjob. We have shamefully

316
00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:35.147
my job. We have shamefully

underpaid, undertreated, undervalue

318
00:10:35.606 --> 00:10:36.772
underpaid, undertreated, undervalue
people who work in this vital

00:10:36.772 --> 00:10:38.564
peopla who work in this vital
sector.

320
00:10:38.564 --> 00:10:40.522
people who work in this vital
sector. We have done this for a very

321
00:10:40.522 --> 00:10:43.272
sector. We have done this for a very
long time and we need the get them

322
00:10:43.272 --> 00:10:45.939
long time and we need the get them
the support they need to do their

importantjob safely. when this is
over we

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.564
importantjob safely. When this is
over we need a proper reckoning as a

329
00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:50.981
over we need a proper reckoning as a
country about how we came to get

330
00:10:50.981 --> 00:10:57.356
country about how we came to get
this so badly wrong. Karen? We are

331
00:10:57.356 --> 00:11:01.689
this so badly wrong. Karen? We are
in awe of the NHS and what they have

332
00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:03.647
in awe of the NHS and what they have
done. But who has mentioned the care

333
00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:04.106
done. But who has mentioned the rare
sector in

334
00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:04.939
done. But who has mentioned the care
sector in the last month and

335
00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:09.147
sector in the last month and
suddenly it has come to light? 1.5

336
00:11:09.147 --> 00:11:12.564
suddenly it has come to light? 1.5
million people work in the sector,

337
00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:12.897
million peopla work in the sector,
doing an

338
00:11:12.897 --> 00:11:14.481
million people work in the sector,
doing an amazing job in difficult

339
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:16.356
doing an amazing job in difficult
circumstances and getting paid very

340
00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:17.856
circumstances and getting paid very
little and looking after a million

341
00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:18.106
little and looking after a million
peoplo.

342
00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:19.856
little and looking after a million
people. Half of them are in care

343
00:11:19.856 --> 00:11:20.064
peopla. Half of them are in rare
homes

344
00:11:20.064 --> 00:11:21.981
people. Half of them are in care
homes and the other half are at

345
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.856
homes and the other half are at
home. This is extraordinary work and

346
00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:25.189
home. This is extraordinary work and
what I find difficult to understand

347
00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:28.397
what I find difficult to understand
is we have been measuring the sad

348
00:11:28.397 --> 00:11:29.939
is we have been measuring the sad
deaths and every death is awful

349
00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.147
deaths and every death is awful
under my thoughts go out to all of

350
00:11:32.147 --> 00:11:34.231
under my thoughts go out to all of
the families and loved ones. We have

351
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:36.814
the families and loved ones. We have
not been counting the care homes. I

352
00:11:36.814 --> 00:11:37.022
not been counting the rare homes. I
don’t

353
00:11:37.022 --> 00:11:41.314
not been counting the care homes. I
don’t understand. We know from other

354
00:11:41.314 --> 00:11:42.939
don’t understand. We know from other
countries, 50% of the deaths often

355
00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:43.481
countries, 5096 of the deaths often
take place in

356
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:44.856
countries, 50% of the deaths often
take place in care homes and we have

357
00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:45.897
take place in rare homes and we have
not been testing

358
00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:47.439
take place in care homes and we have
not been testing the staff, not been

359
00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:49.147
not been testing the staff, not been
testing the patience. They have been

360
00:11:49.147 --> 00:11:51.522
testing the patience. They have been
going to hospital, and I am hearing

361
00:11:51.522 --> 00:11:53.939
going to hospital, and I am hearing
stories of them going to hospital,

362
00:11:53.939 --> 00:11:55.772
stories of them going to hospital,
not being tested and then going back

363
00:11:55.772 --> 00:11:57.772
not being tested and then going back
to the care homes. 50 at long last

364
00:11:57.772 --> 00:11:58.731
to the rare homes. So at long last
it is getting the

365
00:11:58.731 --> 00:12:00.147
to the care homes. 50 at long last
it is getting the attention and the

366
00:12:00.147 --> 00:12:01.731
it is getting the attention and the
focus it deserves. We will be

367
00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:03.147
focus it deserves. We will be
learning lots of lessons about this

368
00:12:03.147 --> 00:12:03.606
learning lots of lassons about this
and will

369
00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:05.189
learning lots of lessons about this
and will be better as a country

370
00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:07.314
and will be better as a country
looking forward and I think the care

371
00:12:07.314 --> 00:12:08.314
looking forward and I think the rare
sector

372
00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:09.814
looking forward and I think the care
sector will be more highlighted,

373
00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:11.856
sector will be more highlighted,
appreciated, funded and resorts.

374
00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.606
appreciated, funded and resorts.
Gareth Thomas says, to isolate and

375
00:12:13.606 --> 00:12:16.189
Gareth Thomas says, to isolate and
catch the spread of the virus you

376
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:18.939
catch the spread of the virus you
should test everyone in care homes,

377
00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:19.564
should test everyone in rare homes,
when you note

378
00:12:19.564 --> 00:12:20.189
should test everyone in care homes,
when you note the residents that

379
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:22.439
when you note the residents that
have it versus those that don’t,

380
00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:24.106
have it versus those that don’t,
same for the carers. Only then can

381
00:12:24.106 --> 00:12:24.856
same for the carers. Only then ran
you isolate and

382
00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:25.731
same for the carers. Only then can
you isolate and deal with the

383
00:12:25.731 --> 00:12:28.106
you isolate and deal with the
coronavirus. If we knew from the

384
00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:30.731
coronavirus. If we knew from the
start, says Rona, this will kill

385
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:31.981
start, says Rona, this will kill
older and vulnerable people more,

386
00:12:31.981 --> 00:12:32.689
older and vulnerable peopla more,
why weren’t

387
00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:34.064
older and vulnerable people more,
why weren’t nursing in care homes

388
00:12:34.064 --> 00:12:34.481
why weren’t nursing in rare homes
the priority?

389
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:36.314
why weren’t nursing in care homes
the priority? What else can we

390
00:12:36.314 --> 00:12:38.189
the priority? What else can we
conclude except they didn’t care. It

391
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.772
conclude except they didn’t rare. It
does

392
00:12:38.772 --> 00:12:41.189
conclude except they didn’t care. It
does seem odd, Robert, the advice

393
00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:42.397
does seem odd, Robert, the advice
given by Public Health England in

394
00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:42.772
given by Public Health England in
Febmary at

395
00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:45.481
given by Public Health England in
February at the start of all this,

396
00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:50.606
February at the start of all this,
whilst it

397
00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:53.356
whilst it remains unlikely that
peopla

398
00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.397
whilst it remains unlikely that
people receiving care in a care home

399
00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:55.647
people receiving rare in a rare home
would

400
00:12:55.647 --> 00:12:56.897
people receiving care in a care home
would become infected. There was no

401
00:12:56.897 --> 00:12:58.939
would become infected. There was no
PPE and they were told not to wear

402
00:12:58.939 --> 00:13:02.106
PPE and they were told not to wear
masks because they serve no purpose.

403
00:13:02.106 --> 00:13:03.189
masks because they serve no purpose.
Looking back with hindsight, that

404
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:06.772
Looking back with hindsight, that
seems extraordinary? It was advice

405
00:13:06.772 --> 00:13:08.564
seems extraordinary? It was advice
that was tendered, listen to and the

406
00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:10.481
that was tendered, listen to and the
priority was given to the front line

407
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:12.689
priority was given to the front line
in the NHS. Do you think it was the

408
00:13:12.689 --> 00:13:16.147
in the NHS. Do you think it was the
right advice? Care homes are complex

409
00:13:16.147 --> 00:13:16.939
right advice? (“are homes are complex
places. If they

410
00:13:16.939 --> 00:13:18.356
right advice? Care homes are complex
places. If they can be managed in a

411
00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:19.647
places. If they ran be managed in a
way, if there is a

412
00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:19.856
places. If they can be managed in a
way, if there is a particular

413
00:13:19.856 --> 00:13:21.439
way, if there is a particular
problem on a particular wing and

414
00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:21.772
problem on a particular wing and
they ran

415
00:13:21.772 --> 00:13:23.606
problem on a particular wing and
they can isolate that group of

416
00:13:23.606 --> 00:13:24.147
they ran isolate that group of
peopla

417
00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:25.606
they can isolate that group of
people carefully, it can be managed

418
00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:25.939
peopla carefully, it ran be managed
in a

419
00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:27.897
people carefully, it can be managed
in a sensible way. But there is no

420
00:13:27.897 --> 00:13:30.314
in a sensible way. But there is no
doubt, because of the age and the

421
00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:34.356
doubt, because of the age and the
vulnerability, the fact elderly

422
00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:34.522
vulnerability, the fact elderty
peopla

423
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:35.897
vulnerability, the fact elderly
people are suffering with complex

424
00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:38.314
people are suffering with complex
conditions. That was not my point.

425
00:13:38.314 --> 00:13:39.314
conditions. That was not my point.
when you have

426
00:13:39.314 --> 00:13:40.731
conditions. That was not my point.
When you have a lot of people with

427
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:41.106
when you have a lot of peopla with
undertying

428
00:13:41.106 --> 00:13:41.689
When you have a lot of people with
underlying conditions and are

429
00:13:41.689 --> 00:13:41.897
undertying conditions and are
elderty

430
00:13:41.897 --> 00:13:42.939
underlying conditions and are
elderly they will be vulnerable to

431
00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:43.022
elderty they will be vulnerable to
this

432
00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:47.439
elderly they will be vulnerable to
this disease. Robert, I think that

433
00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:49.314
this disease. Robert, I think that
is slightly disingenuous. We had a

434
00:13:49.314 --> 00:13:50.439
is slightly disingenuous. We had a
lot of information from other

435
00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:51.814
lot of information from other
countries who were ahead of us in

436
00:13:51.814 --> 00:13:55.314
countries who were ahead of us in
terms of the impact on people in

437
00:13:55.314 --> 00:13:55.772
terms of the impact on peopla in
rare

438
00:13:55.772 --> 00:13:57.106
terms of the impact on people in
care homes from this virus. 50 we

439
00:13:57.106 --> 00:13:57.439
rare homes from this vims. So we
knew exactly

440
00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:59.731
care homes from this virus. 50 we
knew exactly what we were going to

441
00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:01.772
knew exactly what we were going to
be up against. For example, in Italy

442
00:14:01.772 --> 00:14:04.772
be up against. For example, in Italy
and Spain ahead of us on the curve,

443
00:14:04.772 --> 00:14:07.356
and Spain ahead of us on the curve,
we had the most appalling reports of

444
00:14:07.356 --> 00:14:09.314
we had the most appalling reports of
paramedics going into resident’s

445
00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:09.522
paramedic going into resident’s
homes

446
00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:10.564
paramedics going into resident’s
homes and care homes and finding

447
00:14:10.564 --> 00:14:11.564
homes and rare homes and finding
those elderty

448
00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:12.106
homes and care homes and finding
those elderly men and women

449
00:14:12.106 --> 00:14:14.814
those elderly men and women
literally lying dead in their beds.

450
00:14:14.814 --> 00:14:16.772
literally lying dead in their beds.
They had just died of coronavirus

451
00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:19.731
They had just died of coronavirus
with nobody there, they had died

452
00:14:19.731 --> 00:14:21.147
with nobody there, they had died
alone, the worst possible kind of

453
00:14:21.147 --> 00:14:23.064
alone, the worst possible kind of
death. We knew that weeks and weeks

454
00:14:23.064 --> 00:14:25.772
death. We knew that weeks and weeks
ago. The other thing that is

455
00:14:25.772 --> 00:14:28.022
ago. The other thing that is
important to stress is, what we are

456
00:14:28.022 --> 00:14:29.856
important to stress is, what we are
hearing about PPE, it is easy to

457
00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:32.856
hearing about PPE, it is easy to
talk about that in abstract terms,

458
00:14:32.856 --> 00:14:35.814
talk about that in abstract terms,
but for the people who are actually

459
00:14:35.814 --> 00:14:36.981
but for the peopla who are actually
raring for

460
00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.314
but for the people who are actually
caring for these patients, whether

461
00:14:38.314 --> 00:14:40.106
raring for these patients, whether
they are NHS

462
00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:42.897
caring for these patients, whether
they are NHS or social carers, it is

463
00:14:42.897 --> 00:14:44.356
they are NHS or social carers, it is
really hard to overemphasise how

464
00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:49.022
really hard to overemphasise how
frightening it is to go to work, put

465
00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:51.689
frightening it is to go to work, put
on PPE, that you know in many cases

466
00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:54.147
on PPE, that you know in many cases
is lower in standards than the WHO

467
00:14:54.147 --> 00:14:56.564
is lower in standards than the WHO
standards. You do the best you can,

468
00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:57.231
standards. You do the best you ran,
you rannot do

469
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:58.522
standards. You do the best you can,
you cannot do anything but help your

470
00:14:58.522 --> 00:15:00.147
you cannot do anything but help your
vulnerable patients or people you

471
00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:00.814
vulnerable patients or people you
are raring for,

472
00:15:00.814 --> 00:15:02.856
vulnerable patients or people you
are caring for, but you know it is

473
00:15:02.856 --> 00:15:04.022
are raring for, but you know it is
inadequate.

474
00:15:04.022 --> 00:15:05.064
are caring for, but you know it is
inadequate. That is even in hospital

475
00:15:05.064 --> 00:15:06.897
inadequate. That is even in hospital
sometimes where we are getting the

476
00:15:06.897 --> 00:15:09.439
sometimes where we are getting the
best supply of PPE. In care homes, I

477
00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:09.647
best supply of PPE. In rare homes, I
know

478
00:15:09.647 --> 00:15:11.606
best supply of PPE. In care homes, I
know because people are telling me,

479
00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:12.106
know because peopla are telling me,
I work

480
00:15:12.106 --> 00:15:13.772
know because people are telling me,
I work with carers, they having to

481
00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:15.772
I work with carers, they having to
do things like literally where a

482
00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:17.856
do things like literally where a
sanitary towel over their face

483
00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:19.522
sanitary towel over their face
because that is the best they can

484
00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:20.522
because that is the best they ran
come up with

485
00:15:20.522 --> 00:15:22.064
because that is the best they can
come up with to protect themselves

486
00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:23.897
come up with to protect themselves
from infection. They are not getting

487
00:15:23.897 --> 00:15:26.272
from infection. They are not getting
the masks, they are having to reuse

488
00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:27.939
the masks, they are having to reuse
the masks, they are not getting the

489
00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:29.356
the masks, they are not getting the
gowns and they are not getting

490
00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:30.939
gowns and they are not getting
everything they need. They should

491
00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:32.064
everything they need. They should
have protection on their eyes and

492
00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:33.856
have protection on their eyes and
they are not getting it. They still

493
00:15:33.856 --> 00:15:35.314
they are not getting it. They still
help these vulnerable patients and

494
00:15:35.314 --> 00:15:36.939
help these vulnerable patients and
they do that putting their own lives

495
00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:39.897
they do that putting their own lives
at risk and the lives of their

496
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:40.731
at risk and the lives of their
children, their

is just not

00:15:42.772 --> 00:15:44.106
children, theirfamilies at risk. It
isjust not acceptable

502
00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:44.856
children, theirfamilies at risk. It
is just not acceptable to say, we

503
00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:47.356
is just not acceptable to say, we
are doing more, we are going to fix

within the remit of this country and

509
00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:00.189
within the remit of this country and
this government to produce

sufficient paper masks and plastic
gowns to protect carers and if not,

why not?

lives on the line every day. They
have been ignored by successive

00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:20.939
have been ignored by successive
governments. We can’t even order PPE

521
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:24.856
governments. We can’t even order PPE
for their safety. Despite that, they

remain diligent and professional.

nightmare

possible crisis. It is a living
nightmare for the business sector.

557
00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:19.397
nightmare for the business sector.
Not just in the

558
00:17:19.397 --> 00:17:20.314
nightmare for the business sector.
Notjust in the UK, but around the

559
00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:21.939
Not just in the UK, but around the
world. It is

560
00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:23.897
Notjust in the UK, but around the
world. It is a demand shock, supply

561
00:17:23.897 --> 00:17:26.064
world. It is a demand shock, supply
shocks, domino effect, everybody in

562
00:17:26.064 --> 00:17:28.897
shocks, domino effect, everybody in
the supply chain. In our case, we

563
00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:29.356
the supply chain. In our use, we
sunplv

564
00:17:29.356 --> 00:17:30.647
the supply chain. In our case, we
supply thousands of restaurants.

565
00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:31.897
supply thousands of restaurants.
Basically, they are all shocked.

566
00:17:31.897 --> 00:17:33.772
Basically, they are all shocked.
They are not allowed to operate.

567
00:17:33.772 --> 00:17:35.731
They are not allowed to operate.
Some do take away, but that’s only a

568
00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:38.314
Some do take away, but that’s only a
small amount. They have no revenue.

569
00:17:38.314 --> 00:17:40.272
small amount. They have no revenue.
It directly affects us and the vast

570
00:17:40.272 --> 00:17:42.439
It directly affects us and the vast
majority of our sales are in the

571
00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:44.022
majority of our sales are in the
foundation of restaurants. We can

572
00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:44.481
foundation of restaurants. We ran
sunplv

573
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:45.522
foundation of restaurants. We can
supply supermarkets, but with the

574
00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:46.814
supply supermarkets, but with the
production, we can’t produce because

575
00:17:46.814 --> 00:17:50.147
production, we can’t produce because
a lot of staff are not, for safety

576
00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:52.606
a lot of staff are not, for safety
reasons, working. 50 the production

577
00:17:52.606 --> 00:17:52.897
reasons, working. So the production
is

578
00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:53.606
reasons, working. 50 the production
is reduced. Even supermarket sales

579
00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:55.856
is reduced. Even supermarket sales
are not as high as they could be. We

580
00:17:55.856 --> 00:18:00.439
are not as high as they could be. We
are affected very badly. We hold

581
00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:01.856
are affected very badly. We hold
webinars with the restaurants every

582
00:18:01.856 --> 00:18:05.272
webinars with the restaurants every
week and they are crying. They have

583
00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:06.147
week and they are crying. They have

00:18:06.147 --> 00:18:07.481

run out of cash already. The loans,

a huge amount of

586
00:18:08.231 --> 00:18:09.272
run out of cash already. The loans,
a huge amount of money has been

587
00:18:09.272 --> 00:18:11.522
a huge amount of money has been
provided by the government, is that

600
00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:31.856

not having landlords able to throw

601
00:18:31.856 --> 00:18:33.772
not having landlords able to throw
you out for three months. That has

602
00:18:33.772 --> 00:18:35.689
you out for three months. That has
been fantastic. Grants as well. At

603
00:18:35.689 --> 00:18:40.481
been fantastic. Grants as well. At
the one help that businesses need is

the one help that businesses need is

the one help that businesses need is
Cash now, and that is the business

particularly the one for under £145

00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:53.189
million turnover company is. It’s
not working as well as it should.

612
00:18:53.189 --> 00:18:55.772
not working as well as it should.
300,000 businesses applied for

613
00:18:55.772 --> 00:18:57.772
300,000 businesses applied for
these. At the moment, the Government

614
00:18:57.772 --> 00:18:58.481
these. At the moment, the Government
guarantees 8096

615
00:18:58.481 --> 00:19:00.356
these. At the moment, the Government
guarantees 80% of the loans. Out of

guarantees 8096 of the loans. Out of
the

the 300,000, just 6000 have been
given the loans, three and a half

given the loans, three and a half
weeks later. Only £1 billion out of

620
00:19:06.522 --> 00:19:09.731
weeks later. Only £1 billion out of
this. I think the main reason, and I

621
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.397
this. I think the main reason, and I
were saying this from the beginning,

622
00:19:11.397 --> 00:19:13.356
were saying this from the beginning,
we’ve got to be like Germany is

623
00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:15.397
we’ve got to be like Germany is
doing, like Switzerland is doing,

624
00:19:15.397 --> 00:19:16.064
doing, like Switzeriand is doing,
where

625
00:19:16.064 --> 00:19:16.856
doing, like Switzerland is doing,
where the government guarantees 100%

626
00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:19.064
where the government guarantees 10096
of the

where the government guarantees 100%
of the loans

628
00:19:19.314 --> 00:19:19.606
where the government guarantees 10096
of the loans up

629
00:19:19.606 --> 00:19:20.189
where the government guarantees 100%
of the loans up to £500,000. In

630
00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:21.481
of the loans up to £500,000. In
Switzerland, they guarantee to give

631
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:22.814
Switzertand, they guarantee to give
you that

632
00:19:22.814 --> 00:19:24.314
Switzerland, they guarantee to give
you that money and 48 hours. I know

633
00:19:24.314 --> 00:19:26.106
you that money and 48 hours. I know
businesses that have got the loan,

634
00:19:26.106 --> 00:19:26.314
businesses that have got the loan,
appﬁed

635
00:19:26.314 --> 00:19:28.106
businesses that have got the loan,
applied for it and got it within 12

636
00:19:28.106 --> 00:19:31.897
applied for it and got it within 12
hours. We need to apply, within a

637
00:19:31.897 --> 00:19:32.939
hours. We need to apply, within a
limit, £500,000, because it is

638
00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:36.189
limit, £500,000, because it is
mainly the SMEs that need that help.

639
00:19:36.189 --> 00:19:37.647
mainly the SMB that need that help.
If they get

640
00:19:37.647 --> 00:19:38.272
mainly the SMEs that need that help.
If they get that 100% guarantee,

641
00:19:38.272 --> 00:19:38.439
If they get that 10096 guarantee,
then

642
00:19:38.439 --> 00:19:40.189
If they get that 100% guarantee,
then the banks will be able to lend

643
00:19:40.189 --> 00:19:40.439
then the banks will be able to land
that

644
00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.314
then the banks will be able to lend
that money. Because they won’t be

645
00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:45.481
that money. Because they won’t be
worrying about being liable for the

646
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:47.897
worrying about being liable for the
20%? The Government is going the

647
00:19:47.897 --> 00:19:48.022
2096? The Government is going the
extra

648
00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:49.981
20%? The Government is going the
extra mile. Interest rates are 0.1%,

649
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.981
extra mile. Interest rates are 0.196,
the lowest

650
00:19:51.981 --> 00:19:53.897
extra mile. Interest rates are 0.1%,
the lowest since when the Bank of

651
00:19:53.897 --> 00:19:55.106
the lowest since when the Bank of
England was founded. You have to

652
00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:56.981
England was founded. You have to
give credit to what the Government

653
00:19:56.981 --> 00:19:58.647
give credit to what the Government
is doing. Do this extra bit and the

654
00:19:58.647 --> 00:20:00.022
is doing. Do this extra bit and the
money will flow through and then the

655
00:20:00.022 --> 00:20:01.189
money will flow through and then the
businesses will get the cash they

656
00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:01.439
businesses will get the rash they
need

657
00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:03.106
businesses will get the cash they
need now. And they need the cash.

658
00:20:03.106 --> 00:20:03.314
need now. And they need the rash.
What

659
00:20:03.314 --> 00:20:03.522
need now. And they need the rash.
what is

660
00:20:03.522 --> 00:20:05.272
need now. And they need the cash.
What is the point of these other

661
00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:07.439
What is the point of these other
measures? The employee support

662
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.564
measures? The employee support
scheme is fantastic, £250,000 a

663
00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:11.397
scheme is fantastic, £250,000 a
month,

664
00:20:11.397 --> 00:20:11.897
scheme is fantastic, £250,000 3
month, 80% of

665
00:20:11.897 --> 00:20:12.606
scheme is fantastic, £250,000 a
month, 80% of salaries, it’s great.

666
00:20:12.606 --> 00:20:13.314
month, 8096 of salaries, it’s great.
If the company

667
00:20:13.314 --> 00:20:13.814
month, 80% of salaries, it’s great.
If the company isn’t surviving when

668
00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:15.481
If the company isn’t surviving when
we come out of the lockdown, they

669
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.856
we come out of the lockdown, they
need this cash to survive. I think

670
00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:21.356
need this rash to survive. I think
the 1001:

671
00:20:21.356 --> 00:20:22.814
need this cash to survive. I think
the 100% will do it. Lisa? I think

672
00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:22.981
the 10096 will do it. Lisa? I think
the

673
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.397
the 100% will do it. Lisa? I think
the Government was right to extend

674
00:20:26.397 --> 00:20:28.356
the Government was right to extend
the lockdown today. I think we have

675
00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:30.189
the lockdown today. I think we have
to be guided by the evidence about

676
00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:33.564
to be guided by the evidence about
infection rates and whether this is

677
00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:35.272
infection rates and whether this is
under control, and the criteria they

678
00:20:35.272 --> 00:20:36.689
under control, and the criteria they
set out around making sure the NHS

679
00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:40.231
set out around making sure the NHS
could cope, in particular, that is

680
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:41.689
could cope, in particular, that is
very, very important. There are

681
00:20:41.689 --> 00:20:42.981
very, very important. There are
definitely things that could be done

682
00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:45.689
definitely things that could be done
now to help deal with the economic

683
00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:48.856
now to help deal with the economic
fallout from all of this. I very,

684
00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:52.272
fallout from all of this. I very,
very much agree that the loan scheme

685
00:20:52.272 --> 00:20:55.772
very much agree that the loan scheme
to small businesses needs to be

686
00:20:55.772 --> 00:21:00.731
to small businesses needs to be
reformed.

687
00:21:01.897 --> 00:21:06.981
reformed. The number that have been
able to access this is a vanishingly

688
00:21:06.981 --> 00:21:08.939
able to access this is a vanishingly
small. And that’s because the banks

689
00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:09.731
small. And that’s because the banks
are reluctant to lend

690
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:10.189
small. And that’s because the banks
are reluctant to [end because the

691
00:21:10.189 --> 00:21:10.397
are reluctant to lend because the
government

692
00:21:10.397 --> 00:21:13.231
are reluctant to [end because the
government tracker hasn’t

693
00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:14.897
government tracker hasn’t
underwritten 100% of those loans, as

694
00:21:14.897 --> 00:21:15.314
underwritben10096 of those loans, as
you rightly

695
00:21:15.314 --> 00:21:17.272
underwritten 100% of those loans, as
you rightly heard has been done in

696
00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:18.356
you rightly heard has been done in
Germany and Switzerland. That means

697
00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:18.481
Germany and Switzertand. That means
that

698
00:21:18.481 --> 00:21:20.064
Germany and Switzerland. That means
that businesses are not getting the

699
00:21:20.064 --> 00:21:21.981
that businesses are not getting the
help they need. I have businesses in

700
00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:24.314
help they need. I have businesses in
wigan that are

701
00:21:24.314 --> 00:21:24.814
help they need. I have businesses in
Wigan that are perfectly profitable,

702
00:21:24.814 --> 00:21:24.981
wigan that are perfectly profitabla,
healthy,

703
00:21:24.981 --> 00:21:26.231
Wigan that are perfectly profitable,
healthy, viable businesses, but they

704
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:29.689
healthy, viable businesses, but they
are taking a short—term hit now

705
00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:30.939
are taking a short-term hit now
because they

706
00:21:30.939 --> 00:21:32.439
are taking a short—term hit now
because they are say a travel

707
00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:33.231
because they are say a travel
business, where people clearly

708
00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:33.439
business, where peopla dearty
aren’t

709
00:21:33.439 --> 00:21:34.772
business, where people clearly
aren’t booking holidays at the

710
00:21:34.772 --> 00:21:36.439
aren’t booking holidays at the
moment. But once this is over, they

711
00:21:36.439 --> 00:21:38.439
moment. But once this is over, they
will start to see recovery. They

712
00:21:38.439 --> 00:21:40.814
will start to see recovery. They
need the cash now, and they simply

713
00:21:40.814 --> 00:21:42.231
need the rash now, and they simply
can’t get it. But I

714
00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:42.981
need the cash now, and they simply
can’t get it. But I think alongside

715
00:21:42.981 --> 00:21:45.772
can’t get it. But I think alongside
that as well, we need to think about

716
00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:47.897
that as well, we need to think about
what is our exit strategy for

717
00:21:47.897 --> 00:21:49.689
what is our exit strategy for
lockdown, and started to set out

718
00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:51.356
lockdown, and started to set out
some clarity from the government

719
00:21:51.356 --> 00:21:52.939
some clarity from the government
about how they anticipate is

720
00:21:52.939 --> 00:21:55.356
about how they anticipate is
looking. Because many of these small

721
00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:56.606
looking. Because many of these small
businesses are having to make

722
00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:58.689
businesses are having to make
decisions about how long they can

723
00:21:58.689 --> 00:21:59.981
decisions about how long they ran
remain

724
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:00.814
decisions about how long they can
remain viable in this situation.

725
00:22:00.814 --> 00:22:01.231
remain viabla in this situation.
They may

726
00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:02.606
remain viable in this situation.
They may need additional support, if

727
00:22:02.606 --> 00:22:04.772
They may need additional support, if
this is going to go on for a long

728
00:22:04.772 --> 00:22:06.772
this is going to go on for a long
time. In other countries, the

729
00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:08.439
time. In other countries, the
lifting of restrictions has happened

730
00:22:08.439 --> 00:22:11.356
lifting of restrictions has happened
in very, very different ways. In

731
00:22:11.356 --> 00:22:12.439
in very, very different ways. In
some countries, small businesses

732
00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:14.606
some countries, small businesses
have been allowed to reopen, small

733
00:22:14.606 --> 00:22:17.064
have been allowed to reopen, small
shops have been allowed to reopen. I

734
00:22:17.064 --> 00:22:18.231
shops have been allowed to reopen. I
was speaking to the Prime Minister

735
00:22:18.231 --> 00:22:23.856
was speaking to the Prime Minister
in Sweden today, who... They have

736
00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:25.231
in Sweden today, who... They have
pursued a strategy of keeping some

737
00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:28.397
pursued a strategy of keeping some
businesses open and still running.

738
00:22:28.397 --> 00:22:28.814
businesses open and still mnning.
If

739
00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.606
businesses open and still running.
If businesses knew what the

740
00:22:30.606 --> 00:22:32.064
If businesses knew what the
Government was intending, they would

741
00:22:32.064 --> 00:22:33.856
Government was intending, they would
be able to start planning for this

742
00:22:33.856 --> 00:22:35.439
be able to start planning for this
now. At the moment, they

743
00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:35.731
be able to start planning for this
now. At the moment, theyjust don’t

744
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:36.731
now. At the moment, they just don’t
have the clarity

745
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:37.772
now. At the moment, theyjust don’t
have the clarity that they need

746
00:22:37.772 --> 00:22:39.147
have the clarity that they need
about what the Government is

747
00:22:39.147 --> 00:22:41.647
about what the Government is
proposing. And that means when we do

748
00:22:41.647 --> 00:22:43.606
proposing. And that means when we do
come out of this immediate public

749
00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:46.772
come out of this immediate public
health crisis, we may find that a

750
00:22:46.772 --> 00:22:47.397
health crisis, we may find that a
lot of peopla

751
00:22:47.397 --> 00:22:48.397
health crisis, we may find that a
lot of people don’t have those jobs

752
00:22:48.397 --> 00:22:50.897
lot of peopla don’t have those jobs
to go back to.

753
00:22:50.897 --> 00:22:51.647
lot of people don’t have those jobs
to go back to. Two things there,

754
00:22:51.647 --> 00:22:53.064
to go back to. Two things there,
Robert. Duncan asked how we can get

755
00:22:53.064 --> 00:22:53.689
Robert. Duncan asked how we ran get
out of the

756
00:22:53.689 --> 00:22:58.606
Robert. Duncan asked how we can get
out of the lockdown. Karan

757
00:22:58.606 --> 00:22:59.147
Robert. Duncan asked how we can get
out of the lockdown. Karen and Lisa

758
00:22:59.147 --> 00:22:59.731
out of the lockdown. Karan and Lisa
were talking

759
00:22:59.731 --> 00:23:00.981
out of the lockdown. Karen and Lisa
were talking about the business

760
00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:03.397
were talking about the business
interruption loans, going to 100%

761
00:23:03.397 --> 00:23:05.939
interruption loans, going to 100%
instead of 80%. But also giving

762
00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:07.647
instead of 80%. But also giving
business uncertainty, where you can,

763
00:23:07.647 --> 00:23:07.772
business uncertainty, where you ran,
about

764
00:23:07.772 --> 00:23:09.939
business uncertainty, where you can,
about when they might start to begin

765
00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:11.314
about when they might start to begin
to think about... Because they need

766
00:23:11.314 --> 00:23:14.397
to think about... Because they need
to plan, for when they might be

767
00:23:14.397 --> 00:23:16.522
to plan, for when they might be
coming out of it? We can’t get away

768
00:23:16.522 --> 00:23:19.564
coming out of it? We can’t get away
from the inherent uncertainty that

769
00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:22.314
from the inherent uncertainty that
we face. First of all, Karan’s point

770
00:23:22.314 --> 00:23:24.106
we face. First of all, Karen’s point
about the banks and their role in

771
00:23:24.106 --> 00:23:24.189
about the banks and their rola in
this,

772
00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:27.814
about the banks and their role in
this, we have already taken action

773
00:23:27.814 --> 00:23:28.981
this, we have already taken action
to de-dog the

774
00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:30.231
this, we have already taken action
to de—clog the process, to make it

775
00:23:30.231 --> 00:23:30.564
to de-dog the process, to make it
easier for

776
00:23:30.564 --> 00:23:31.564
to de—clog the process, to make it
easierfor the money

777
00:23:31.564 --> 00:23:31.731
to de—clog the process, to make it
easier for the money to

778
00:23:31.731 --> 00:23:31.856
to de—clog the process, to make it
easierfor the money to reach

779
00:23:31.856 --> 00:23:32.106
to de—clog the process, to make it
easier for the money to reach the

780
00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:34.189
easier for the money to reach the
firms and people it is intended to

781
00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:34.356
firms and peopla it is intended to
reach.

782
00:23:34.356 --> 00:23:35.606
firms and people it is intended to
reach. The Treasury is constantly

783
00:23:35.606 --> 00:23:37.356
reach. The Treasury is constantly
looking at the scheme and its

784
00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:39.397
looking at the scheme and its
operation to see how better... What

785
00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:39.481
operation to see how better... what
about

786
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:45.356
operation to see how better... What
about businesses increasing the loan

787
00:23:45.356 --> 00:23:47.689
about businesses increasing the loan
coverage to 100%? Is a fair point. I

788
00:23:47.689 --> 00:23:48.689
coverage to10096? Is a fair point. I
know the

789
00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:49.856
coverage to 100%? Is a fair point. I
know the Treasury is considering the

790
00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:51.606
know the Treasury is considering the
operation of the scheme daily. They

791
00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:53.856
operation of the scheme daily. They
set it up at breakneck speed. I

792
00:23:53.856 --> 00:23:55.522
set it up at breakneck speed. I
think tribute is being paid to the

793
00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:56.606
think tribute is being paid to the
fact that the Government really

794
00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:58.147
fact that the Government really
stood up to the challenge and got on

795
00:23:58.147 --> 00:23:58.814
stood up to the challenge and got on
with it. I

796
00:23:58.814 --> 00:23:58.981
stood up to the challenge and got on
with it. Ithink

797
00:23:58.981 --> 00:23:59.981
stood up to the challenge and got on
with it. I think the answer is that

798
00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:01.606
with it. I think the answer is that
we are looking daily at the

799
00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.189
we are looking daily at the
operation of this, because our

800
00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:04.689
operation of this, because our
intention is, as the Chancellor

801
00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:06.272
intention is, as the Chancellor
said, that we will do what it takes.

802
00:24:06.272 --> 00:24:09.231
said, that we will do what it takes.
And we mean what we say buy that.

803
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:09.981
And we mean what we say buy that.
when we get

804
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:12.606
And we mean what we say buy that.
When we get comments in, for

805
00:24:12.606 --> 00:24:13.772
when we get comments in, for
example, I mn

806
00:24:13.772 --> 00:24:14.397
When we get comments in, for
example, I run a business employing

807
00:24:14.397 --> 00:24:15.147
example, I nm a business employing
17 people and I

808
00:24:15.147 --> 00:24:16.022
example, I run a business employing
17 people and I haven’t had a penny.

809
00:24:16.022 --> 00:24:16.939
17 peopla and I haven’t had a penny.
I haven’t

810
00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:17.231
17 people and I haven’t had a penny.
I haven’t had

811
00:24:17.231 --> 00:24:17.397
17 peopla and I haven’t had a penny.
I haven’t had any

812
00:24:17.397 --> 00:24:18.606
17 people and I haven’t had a penny.
I haven’t had any grants, loans, I

813
00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:20.439
I haven’t had any grants, loans, I
can’t get furlough money for myself.

814
00:24:20.439 --> 00:24:22.522
can’t get furlough money for myself.
I’m taking no salary. If I am still

815
00:24:22.522 --> 00:24:24.939
I’m taking no salary. If I am still
in business in two weeks, it will be

816
00:24:24.939 --> 00:24:26.939
in business in two weeks, it will be
a miracle. Another, and the

817
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:28.814
a miracle. Another, and the
government back do more to ensure

818
00:24:28.814 --> 00:24:30.064
government back do more to ensure
that small businesses can get access

819
00:24:30.064 --> 00:24:31.189
that small businesses ran get access
to the support

820
00:24:31.189 --> 00:24:32.022
that small businesses can get access
to the support they have announced?

821
00:24:32.022 --> 00:24:33.231
to the support they have announced?
Banks are taking too long and

822
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:36.189
Banks are taking too long and
declining application for

823
00:24:36.189 --> 00:24:36.689
declining application for
coronavirus business interruption

824
00:24:36.689 --> 00:24:38.564

825
00:24:38.564 --> 00:24:40.439
coronavirus business interruption
loans, despite having a viable

826
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:41.939
loans, despite having a viable
business. We help the bank with

827
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.064
business. We help the bank with
billions, they must do more. You

828
00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:45.606
billions, they must do more. You
must have heard this time and time

829
00:24:45.606 --> 00:24:47.564
must have heard this time and time
again? what ran

830
00:24:47.564 --> 00:24:48.606
must have heard this time and time
again? What can you practically do?

831
00:24:48.606 --> 00:24:49.022
again? what ran you practically do?
That’s right,

832
00:24:49.022 --> 00:24:50.897
again? What can you practically do?
That’s right, the banks have to help

833
00:24:50.897 --> 00:24:52.314
That’s right, the banks have to help
us help everybody else. They have to

834
00:24:52.314 --> 00:24:55.814
us help everybody else. They have to
step up to the mark. This is a very

835
00:24:55.814 --> 00:24:56.814
step up to the mark. This is a very
uncertain and risk—based time. We

836
00:24:56.814 --> 00:24:56.897
uncertain and risk-based time. We
expect

837
00:24:56.897 --> 00:24:59.272
uncertain and risk—based time. We
expect everybody to take their share

838
00:24:59.272 --> 00:25:00.897
expect everybody to take their share
of risk. The Government is laying

839
00:25:00.897 --> 00:25:04.272
of risk. The Government is laying
billions of pounds on the line here

840
00:25:04.272 --> 00:25:05.522
billions of pounds on the line here
to save many, many businesses that

841
00:25:05.522 --> 00:25:08.356
to save many, many businesses that
we think are worth saving, because

842
00:25:08.356 --> 00:25:12.397
we think are worth saving, because
they do have a future. This is why

843
00:25:12.397 --> 00:25:14.647
they do have a future. This is why
the Treasury is looking everyday at

844
00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:16.189
the Treasury is looking everyday at
how to improve and refine the system

845
00:25:16.189 --> 00:25:18.856
how to improve and refine the system
to make sure it the people that need

846
00:25:18.856 --> 00:25:23.022
to make sure it the people that need
that money. To the government’s

847
00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:24.022
that money. To the government’s
credit, you listened, right from

848
00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:27.397
credit, you listened, right from
when Rishi announced these are the

849
00:25:27.397 --> 00:25:29.814
when Rishi announced these are the
measures, we said, you left out the

850
00:25:29.814 --> 00:25:30.356
measures, we said, you left out the
self-employed.

851
00:25:30.356 --> 00:25:32.189
measures, we said, you left out the
self—employed. You listened, and the

852
00:25:32.189 --> 00:25:32.314
self-employed. You listened, and the
same

853
00:25:32.314 --> 00:25:32.939
self—employed. You listened, and the
same employee support equivalent

854
00:25:32.939 --> 00:25:34.564
same employee support equivalent
goes to the self—employed. Then we

855
00:25:34.564 --> 00:25:35.772
goes to the self-employed. Then we
said, you left

856
00:25:35.772 --> 00:25:36.356
goes to the self—employed. Then we
said, you left out the charities.

857
00:25:36.356 --> 00:25:38.397
said, you left out the charities.
There is now support for charities.

858
00:25:38.397 --> 00:25:40.272
There is now support for charities.
Maybe not as much as required, but

859
00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:43.897
Maybe not as much as required, but
approaching just under £1 billion.

860
00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:44.022
approaching just under £1 billion.
Similarty,

861
00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:45.897
approaching just under £1 billion.
Similarly, the start—ups, the small

Similarty, the start-ups, the small
businesses,

863
00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:46.606
Similarly, the start—ups, the small
businesses, the entrepreneurship,

864
00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:48.606
businesses, the entrepreneurship,
there is no support for them, but

865
00:25:48.606 --> 00:25:50.606
there is no support for them, but
there is talk of a fund with private

866
00:25:50.606 --> 00:25:53.772
there is talk of a fund with private
and government supported... But that

867
00:25:53.772 --> 00:25:55.814
and government supported... But that
needs to be set up quickly. The

868
00:25:55.814 --> 00:25:59.314
needs to be set up quickly. The
squeezed middle were left out. You

869
00:25:59.314 --> 00:26:00.106
squeezed middle were left out. You
increased the coronavirus business

870
00:26:00.106 --> 00:26:02.731
increased the coronavims business
interruption

871
00:26:02.731 --> 00:26:03.397
increased the coronavirus business
interruption scheme, and hopefully

872
00:26:03.397 --> 00:26:05.606
interruption scheme, and hopefully
will do that more. If you do this

873
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:07.731
will do that more. If you do this
one thing, client ensure you,

874
00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:11.064
one thing, client ensure you,
increase to 100%, it be worth it and

875
00:26:11.064 --> 00:26:11.814
increase to 10096, it be worth it and
the money will

876
00:26:11.814 --> 00:26:12.897
increase to 100%, it be worth it and
the money will flow through. Is

877
00:26:12.897 --> 00:26:13.606
the money will ﬂow through. Is
important to

878
00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:16.231
the money will flow through. Is
important to come back to the

879
00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:16.814
important to come back to the
original question, distress,

880
00:26:16.814 --> 00:26:17.022
original question, distress,
unfortunately,

881
00:26:17.022 --> 00:26:17.314
original question, distress,
u nfortu nately, however

882
00:26:17.314 --> 00:26:17.981
original question, distress,
unfortunately, however much we are

883
00:26:17.981 --> 00:26:20.272
unfortunately, however much we are
all desperate for an exit strategy,

884
00:26:20.272 --> 00:26:21.981
all desperate for an exit strategy,
we need to hear it spells out now.

885
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:22.147
we need to hear it spells out now.
of

886
00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.356
we need to hear it spells out now.
Of course, that’s not really the

887
00:26:23.356 --> 00:26:26.272
Of course, that’s not really the
right way to think about this. There

888
00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:28.272
right way to think about this. There
isn’t an exit strategy. It might be

889
00:26:28.272 --> 00:26:30.981
isn’t an exit strategy. It might be
better to think about a management

890
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:32.147
better to think about a management
strategy for coronavirus. It isn’t

891
00:26:32.147 --> 00:26:34.647
strategy for coronavirus. It isn’t
going to be quick. There is no quick

892
00:26:34.647 --> 00:26:36.689
going to be quick. There is no quick
fix for this. We are not going to

893
00:26:36.689 --> 00:26:39.022
fix for this. We are not going to
suddenly a period where we say we

894
00:26:39.022 --> 00:26:40.856
suddenly a period where we say we
are relaxing the measures and go

895
00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:42.606
are relaxing the measures and go
back to life as normal, however much

896
00:26:42.606 --> 00:26:45.147
back to life as normal, however much
we want to. This is going to be a

897
00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:46.189
we want to. This is going to be a
period of extended social distancing

898
00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:49.772
period of extended social distancing
and restrictions. Until a vaccine is

899
00:26:49.772 --> 00:26:51.106
and restrictions. Until a vaccine is
in place, and that is probably

900
00:26:51.106 --> 00:26:54.522
in place, and that is probably
sometime next year. The important

901
00:26:54.522 --> 00:26:56.772
sometime next year. The important
thing to think about here is what

902
00:26:56.772 --> 00:26:58.689
thing to think about here is what
are the measures we can take to

903
00:26:58.689 --> 00:26:58.939
are the measures we ran take to
reduce

904
00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:00.397
are the measures we can take to
reduce the overall length of time

905
00:27:00.397 --> 00:27:03.606
reduce the overall length of time
that we are restricted, with all of

906
00:27:03.606 --> 00:27:06.022
that we are restricted, with all of
the economic fallout that entails?

907
00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:07.231
the economic fallout that entails?
And, crucially, that comes back to

908
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:11.189
And, crucially, that comes back to
what we started with testing. We

909
00:27:11.189 --> 00:27:13.147
what we started with testing. We
have to test, we have to contact

910
00:27:13.147 --> 00:27:16.022
have to test, we have to contact
trace. If we are relaxing

911
00:27:16.022 --> 00:27:17.647
trace. If we are relaxing
restrictions socially, we have to

912
00:27:17.647 --> 00:27:20.147
restrictions socially, we have to
find another way of containing the

913
00:27:20.147 --> 00:27:20.606
find another way of containing the
vims, reducing

914
00:27:20.606 --> 00:27:23.397
find another way of containing the
virus, reducing transmission. As

915
00:27:23.397 --> 00:27:24.897
virus, reducing transmission. As

only this morning, testing is the

921
00:27:33.814 --> 00:27:35.231
only this morning, testing is the
way to restrict transmission, so you

922
00:27:35.231 --> 00:27:37.314
way to restrict transmission, so you
relax everything in the way that we

923
00:27:37.314 --> 00:27:39.439
relax everything in the way that we
are desperate to, but you have to

are desperate to, but you have to
test as well, you have to ramp it

test as well, you have to ramp it
up. Lisa, you wanted to come back

926
00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:45.731
up. Lisa, you wanted to come back
in? I

up. Lisa, you wanted to come back

00:27:45.939 --> 00:27:47.397
up. Lisa, you wanted to come back
in? I agree with Rachel, but I think

929
00:27:47.397 --> 00:27:47.856
in? Iagree with Rachel, but I think
she has given

930
00:27:47.856 --> 00:27:49.022
in? I agree with Rachel, but I think
she has given more clarity about an

931
00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:52.356
she has given more clarity about an
exit strategy than we have had from

932
00:27:52.356 --> 00:27:53.939
exit strategy than we have had from
the Government. Yesterday, we had a

933
00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.231
the Government. Yesterday, we had a

health minister on social media
saying that there would not be a

00:27:56.856 --> 00:27:58.439
saying that there would not be a
lifting or an easing of these

936
00:27:58.439 --> 00:28:00.606
lifting or an easing of these
restrictions until a vaccine was in

937
00:28:00.606 --> 00:28:02.397
restrictions until a vaccine was in
place. Effectively suggesting on

938
00:28:02.397 --> 00:28:05.397
place. Effectively suggesting on
Twitter that this is going to be

939
00:28:05.397 --> 00:28:08.064
Twitter that this is going to be
here for 18 months. You’re talking

940
00:28:08.064 --> 00:28:10.147
here for 18 months. You’re talking
about Nadine Dorries? If this is the

941
00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:10.272
about Nadine Dorries? If this is the
use,

942
00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:14.856
about Nadine Dorries? If this is the
case, businesses and people need a

943
00:28:14.856 --> 00:28:15.147
rase, businesses and people need a
level of

944
00:28:15.147 --> 00:28:15.981
case, businesses and people need a
level of understanding about that,

945
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:17.731
level of understanding about that,
they need the confidence in what the

946
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:19.272
they need the confidence in what the
Government is doing and why they are

947
00:28:19.272 --> 00:28:19.897
Government is doing and why they are
doing it. I

948
00:28:19.897 --> 00:28:20.147
Government is doing and why they are
doing it. Ithink

949
00:28:20.147 --> 00:28:20.856
Government is doing and why they are
doing it. I think most people want

950
00:28:20.856 --> 00:28:22.022
doing it. I think most peopla want
to do the right

951
00:28:22.022 --> 00:28:23.064
doing it. I think most people want
to do the right thing, but this is

952
00:28:23.064 --> 00:28:24.356
to do the right thing, but this is
really hard for a lot

953
00:28:24.356 --> 00:28:24.564
to do the right thing, but this is
really ha rd for a lot of

954
00:28:24.564 --> 00:28:24.981
to do the right thing, but this is
really hard for a lot of people. For

955
00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:25.564
really hard for a lot of peopla. For
me, who lives

956
00:28:25.564 --> 00:28:27.814
really hard for a lot of people. For
me, who lives with my family, who

957
00:28:27.814 --> 00:28:29.481
me, who lives with my family, who
has an outside space, we’ve got a

958
00:28:29.481 --> 00:28:31.856
has an outside space, we’ve got a
garden, this is a very different

959
00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:33.314
garden, this is a very different
prospect from somebody who is

960
00:28:33.314 --> 00:28:34.522
prospect from somebody who is
really, really worried they are

961
00:28:34.522 --> 00:28:35.731
really, really worried they are
going to lose their

962
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:36.314
really, really worried they are
going to lose theirjob, who lives

963
00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:40.772
going to lose theirjob, who lives
in an overcrowded ﬂat with no

964
00:28:40.772 --> 00:28:42.689
in an overcrowded ﬂat with no
outside space, who has caring

965
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:43.772
outside space, who has caring
responsibilities or lives alone. So

966
00:28:43.772 --> 00:28:45.147
responsibilities or lives alone. So
the Government needs to set up more

967
00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:47.606
the Government needs to set up more
clarity about how they see this

968
00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:48.814
clarity about how they see this
developing. I appreciate they don’t

969
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:50.772
developing. I appreciate they don’t
want to go out mixed messages, but

970
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:52.272
want to go out mixed messages, but
at the moment, that is what is

971
00:28:52.272 --> 00:28:54.522
at the moment, that is what is
happening. In a public health

972
00:28:54.522 --> 00:28:55.772
happening. In a public health
crisis, the public need confidence

973
00:28:55.772 --> 00:28:57.689
crisis, the public need confidence
that the measures that are being put

974
00:28:57.689 --> 00:28:59.397
that the measures that are being put
in place will work, they need to

975
00:28:59.397 --> 00:29:01.356
in place will work, they need to
understand them and then they will

976
00:29:01.356 --> 00:29:05.314
understand them and then they will
follow them. Do you want to come in,

977
00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:05.647
follow them. Do you want to come in,
brieﬂy? I

978
00:29:05.647 --> 00:29:05.856
follow them. Do you want to come in,
brieﬂy? Itake

979
00:29:05.856 --> 00:29:10.814
follow them. Do you want to come in,
briefly? I take response ——

980
00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:11.231
brieﬂy? I take response --
respectful

981
00:29:11.231 --> 00:29:12.856
briefly? I take response ——
respectful issue with the mixed

982
00:29:12.856 --> 00:29:14.314
respectful issue with the mixed
messages. We don’t want to create

983
00:29:14.314 --> 00:29:17.147
messages. We don’t want to create
mixed messages, and we are not. The

984
00:29:17.147 --> 00:29:18.731
mixed messages, and we are not. The
five tests that were set out today,

985
00:29:18.731 --> 00:29:21.106
five tests that were set out today,
and I think Rachel is right to talk

986
00:29:21.106 --> 00:29:22.356
and I think Rachel is right to talk
about testing, it actually gives a

987
00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:22.731
about testing, it actually gives a
very dear

988
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:25.231
about testing, it actually gives a
very clear map as to how we work our

989
00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:25.397
very dear map as to how we work our
“Y

990
00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:25.939
very dear map as to how we work our
way out of this.

991
00:29:25.939 --> 00:29:26.856
very clear map as to how we work our
way out of this. The advice that is

992
00:29:26.856 --> 00:29:30.481
way out of this. The advice that is
going to be given by the

993
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:32.647
going to be given by the
strategic... The Sage Group, the

994
00:29:32.647 --> 00:29:34.564
strategic... The Sage Group, the
strategic advisory group on... The

995
00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:36.106
strategic advisory group on... The
EWUP

996
00:29:36.106 --> 00:29:38.356
strategic advisory group on... The
group that meets to deal with

997
00:29:38.356 --> 00:29:39.772
group that meets to deal with
emergencies, they will guide the

998
00:29:39.772 --> 00:29:41.314
emergencies, they will guide the
government. We will be looking at

999
00:29:41.314 --> 00:29:42.897
government. We will be looking at
that advice as it develops over the

1000
00:29:42.897 --> 00:29:44.856
that advice as it develops over the
next few weeks. And that is the

1001
00:29:44.856 --> 00:29:46.647
next few weeks. And that is the
approach the public would expect us

1002
00:29:46.647 --> 00:29:48.814
approach the public would expect us
to take, listening to the expert

1003
00:29:48.814 --> 00:29:50.356
to take, listening to the expert
advice, and then having a programme

1004
00:29:50.356 --> 00:29:54.564
advice, and then having a programme
of planned return to normality over

1005
00:29:54.564 --> 00:29:56.064
of planned return to normality over
a period. That’s clear. That is

1006
00:29:56.064 --> 00:29:56.814
a period. That’s dear. That is
something I

1007
00:29:56.814 --> 00:29:58.522
a period. That’s clear. That is
something I think the public

1008
00:29:58.522 --> 00:29:59.647
something I think the public
respect, and they understand. And

1009
00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:01.064
respect, and they understand. And
there is a simplicity and that which

1010
00:30:01.064 --> 00:30:03.272
there is a simplicity and that which
has cut through to millions of

1011
00:30:03.272 --> 00:30:05.106
has cut through to millions of
peopla. You

1012
00:30:05.106 --> 00:30:09.397
has cut through to millions of
people. You mentioned testing, new

1013
00:30:09.397 --> 00:30:12.272
people. You mentioned testing, new
__ you

00:30:12.272 --> 00:30:13.522
people. You mentioned testing, new

Government failed to act for two

1016
00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:16.564
Government failed to act for two
months because they knew we could

1017
00:30:16.564 --> 00:30:18.481
months because they knew we could
not respond in the same way as

1018
00:30:18.481 --> 00:30:21.689
not respond in the same way as
Germany? They managed to test,

1019
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:24.356
Germany? They managed to test,
monitor and hospitalise sooner and

1020
00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:24.814
monitor and hospitalise sooner and
more efficiently, therefore

1021
00:30:24.814 --> 00:30:29.856
more efficiently, therefore
maintaining a much lower death rate.

1022
00:30:29.856 --> 00:30:32.356
maintaining a much lower death rate.
Karan, you have an interesting story

1023
00:30:32.356 --> 00:30:33.606
Karan, you have an interesting story
about testing. You have had

1024
00:30:33.606 --> 00:30:37.272
about testing. You have had
coronavirus, thankfully, it wasn’t a

1025
00:30:37.272 --> 00:30:37.897
coronavims, thankfully, it wasn’t a
pleasant

1026
00:30:37.897 --> 00:30:40.022
coronavirus, thankfully, it wasn’t a
pleasant experience, but you came

1027
00:30:40.022 --> 00:30:41.939
pleasant experience, but you came
out the other side. Now, the

1028
00:30:41.939 --> 00:30:43.064
out the other side. Now, the
Government has talked about trying

1029
00:30:43.064 --> 00:30:45.439
Government has talked about trying
to get the Holy Grail of an antibody

1030
00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:45.897
to get the Holy Grail of an antibody
test. So,

1031
00:30:45.897 --> 00:30:47.147
to get the Holy Grail of an antibody
test. 50, test will tell you if

1032
00:30:47.147 --> 00:30:47.314
to get the Holy Grail of an antibody
test. So, test will tell you if you

1033
00:30:47.314 --> 00:30:48.189
test. So, test will tell you if you
have had it,

1034
00:30:48.189 --> 00:30:48.606
test. 50, test will tell you if you
have had it, and therefore

1035
00:30:48.606 --> 00:30:49.147
test. So, test will tell you if you
have had it, and therefore you may

1036
00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.856
have had it, and therefore you may
have some degree of immunity. So

1037
00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:53.022
have some degree of immunity. So
far, they have not been able to get

1038
00:30:53.022 --> 00:30:54.606
far, they have not been able to get
one that works. But you have managed

1039
00:30:54.606 --> 00:31:00.397
one that works. But you have managed
to get that works?

1040
00:31:00.397 --> 00:31:00.522
ﬂ

1041
00:31:00.522 --> 00:31:00.939
Imaintain

1042
00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:04.897
I maintain personally one of the key
solutions to getting out of this

1043
00:31:04.897 --> 00:31:08.064
solutions to getting out of this
crisis overall is testing. It is the

1044
00:31:08.064 --> 00:31:09.272
crisis overall is testing. It is the
World Health Organization, the head

1045
00:31:09.272 --> 00:31:12.897
World Health Organization, the head
of it lead over a month ago to the

1046
00:31:12.897 --> 00:31:14.356
of it lead over a month ago to the
hold world, test, test, test.

1047
00:31:14.356 --> 00:31:17.356
hold world, test, test, test.
Germany is testing half a million a

1048
00:31:17.356 --> 00:31:19.772
Germany is testing half a million a
week. They were testing over 100,000

1049
00:31:19.772 --> 00:31:21.981
week. They were testing over 100,000
a day and I am glad the government

1050
00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:26.606
a day and I am glad the government
has a target to get to 100,002

1051
00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:30.481
has a target to get to 100,002
weeks, and I hope they do. What

1052
00:31:30.481 --> 00:31:31.439
weeks, and I hope they do. what
works is

1053
00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:33.606
weeks, and I hope they do. What
works is when the government, the

1054
00:31:33.606 --> 00:31:38.856
works is when the government, the
private sector, NHS, Armed Forces,

1055
00:31:38.856 --> 00:31:41.231
private sector, NHS, Armed Forces,
they put up the Nightingale Hospital

1056
00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:43.981
they put up the Nightingale Hospital
in nine days. How did you get hold

1057
00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:46.689
in nine days. How did you get hold
of your antibody test? I will get to

1058
00:31:46.689 --> 00:31:48.606
of your antibody test? I will get to
that, but what works is a

1059
00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:51.689
that, but what works is a
collaboration of universities,

1060
00:31:51.689 --> 00:31:53.356
collaboration of universities,
government, I get the impression it

1061
00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:55.939
government, I get the impression it
has not happened but now I

1062
00:31:55.939 --> 00:31:59.231
has not happened but now I
understand it is. We have the

1063
00:31:59.231 --> 00:31:59.897
understand it is. We have the
pharmaceutical companies, the

1064
00:31:59.897 --> 00:32:02.814
pharmaceutical companies, the
laboratories and the NHS and the

1065
00:32:02.814 --> 00:32:04.772
laboratories and the NHS and the
government working together. In my

1066
00:32:04.772 --> 00:32:05.314
government working together. In my
rase,

1067
00:32:05.314 --> 00:32:05.897
government working together. In my
use, when I

1068
00:32:05.897 --> 00:32:06.856
government working together. In my
case, when I had the disease, the

1069
00:32:06.856 --> 00:32:07.939
rase, when I had the disease, the
infection, I

1070
00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:09.439
case, when I had the disease, the
infection, I could not get tested.

1071
00:32:09.439 --> 00:32:11.314
infection, I could not get tested.
It was only allowed in hospitals and

1072
00:32:11.314 --> 00:32:14.356
It was only allowed in hospitals and
at that time, not even the NHS staff

1073
00:32:14.356 --> 00:32:16.397
at that time, not even the NHS staff
were allowed to get tested. I could

1074
00:32:16.397 --> 00:32:18.356
were allowed to get tested. I could
not get tested and my doctor said

1075
00:32:18.356 --> 00:32:19.939
not get tested and my doctor said
the only way, if you want to find

1076
00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:21.397
the only way, if you want to find
out, I ran

1077
00:32:21.397 --> 00:32:22.856
the only way, if you want to find
out, I can send it to a laboratory

1078
00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:23.856
out, I ran send it to a laboratory
in journey,

1079
00:32:23.856 --> 00:32:24.106
out, I ran send it to a laboratory
injourney, I

1080
00:32:24.106 --> 00:32:24.356
out, I ran send it to a laboratory
injourney, Igot

1081
00:32:24.356 --> 00:32:24.647
out, I can send it to a laboratory
injourney, I got an intravenous

1082
00:32:24.647 --> 00:32:26.606
injourney, I got an intravenous
blood test and then you will get to

1083
00:32:26.606 --> 00:32:28.606
blood test and then you will get to
know for sure. I got the result and

1084
00:32:28.606 --> 00:32:32.856
know for sure. I got the result and
it shows I have the antibodies. Just

1085
00:32:32.856 --> 00:32:33.606
it shows I have the antibodies. just
to be clear,

1086
00:32:33.606 --> 00:32:35.356
it shows I have the antibodies. Just
to be clear, that was a test to show

1087
00:32:35.356 --> 00:32:38.606
to be clear, that was a test to show
you had had it? It was an antibody

1088
00:32:38.606 --> 00:32:40.147
you had had it? It was an antibody
test. The government has the right

1089
00:32:40.147 --> 00:32:43.397
test. The government has the right
approach in wanting to have them

1090
00:32:43.397 --> 00:32:45.606
approach in wanting to have them
widely available and the our home

1091
00:32:45.606 --> 00:32:48.189
widely available and the our home
kits, mass produced in China. There

1092
00:32:48.189 --> 00:32:50.272
kits, mass produced in China. There
is a test to say you have got it at

1093
00:32:50.272 --> 00:32:52.439
is a test to say you have got it at
the moment, but the test you had is

1094
00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:54.689
the moment, but the test you had is
to say you had it. Yes, the antibody

1095
00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:58.231
to say you had it. Yes, the antibody
test. How can Karan get that and no

1096
00:32:58.231 --> 00:32:58.564
test. How ran Karan get that and no
one else

1097
00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:01.522
test. How can Karan get that and no
one else can? The government is

1098
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:02.314
one else ran? The government is
right saying

1099
00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:03.731
one else can? The government is
right saying there’s no point in

1100
00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:04.772
right saying there’s no point in
having antibody tests are widely

1101
00:33:04.772 --> 00:33:05.856
having antibody tests are widely
available if you cannot rely on

1102
00:33:05.856 --> 00:33:09.606
available if you cannot rely on
them. The mass produced ones, take a

1103
00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:12.981
them. The mass produced ones, take a
pinprick and it gives you an instant

1104
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:15.272
pinprick and it gives you an instant
result, but they are giving false

1105
00:33:15.272 --> 00:33:18.481
result, but they are giving false
positives. My mother sent to a

1106
00:33:18.481 --> 00:33:25.564
positives. My mother sent to a
laboratory. In Germany? Why cannot

1107
00:33:25.564 --> 00:33:26.231
laboratory. In Germany? why rannot
they do that

1108
00:33:26.231 --> 00:33:29.856
laboratory. In Germany? Why cannot
they do that here? They clearly

1109
00:33:29.856 --> 00:33:30.564
they do that here? They dearty
exist, they

1110
00:33:30.564 --> 00:33:32.356
they do that here? They clearly
exist, they exist in Germany, why

1111
00:33:32.356 --> 00:33:35.231
exist, they exist in Germany, why
can’t we have them? One of the

1112
00:33:35.231 --> 00:33:37.231
can’t we have them? One of the
issues we found, as Karan said, we

1113
00:33:37.231 --> 00:33:38.814
issues we found, as Karan said, we
have looked to some of these tests

1114
00:33:38.814 --> 00:33:39.939
have looked to some of these tests
that were available, and they did

1115
00:33:39.939 --> 00:33:46.772
that were available, and they did
not pass muster. But this one did?

1116
00:33:46.772 --> 00:33:47.356
not pass muster. But this one did?
Germanrs

1117
00:33:47.356 --> 00:33:47.981
not pass muster. But this one did?
Germany’s diagnostic industry is

1118
00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:48.147
Germanrs diagnostic industry is
much

1119
00:33:48.147 --> 00:33:51.147
Germany’s diagnostic industry is
much bigger than ours. But we don’t

1120
00:33:51.147 --> 00:33:54.147
much bigger than ours. But we don’t
have this test at all? We are

1121
00:33:54.147 --> 00:33:56.064
have this test at all? We are
starting further back in the field

1122
00:33:56.064 --> 00:33:57.772
starting further back in the field
than they are. Their death rate is

1123
00:33:57.772 --> 00:34:00.606
than they are. Their death rate is
lower because their rate of testing

1124
00:34:00.606 --> 00:34:02.439
lower because their rate of testing
has been much higher. If we tested

1125
00:34:02.439 --> 00:34:06.606
has been much higher. If we tested
more, what are death rate to exactly

1126
00:34:06.606 --> 00:34:08.856
more, what are death rate to exactly
the same? If we were testing much

1127
00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:11.606
the same? If we were testing much
more widely we might have a

1128
00:34:11.606 --> 00:34:14.147
more widely we might have a
different set of statistics. What we

1129
00:34:14.147 --> 00:34:15.314
different set of statistic. what we
are doing is

1130
00:34:15.314 --> 00:34:16.606
different set of statistics. What we
are doing is working to ramp it up

1131
00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:19.772
are doing is working to ramp it up
and as Karan said we have the

1132
00:34:19.772 --> 00:34:21.314
and as Karan said we have the
partnership between the public and

1133
00:34:21.314 --> 00:34:23.981
partnership between the public and
private sector now. Just to be

1134
00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:24.147
private sector now. just to be
clear,

1135
00:34:24.147 --> 00:34:25.606
private sector now. Just to be
clear, Robert, sorry. What you seem

1136
00:34:25.606 --> 00:34:26.981
dear, Robert, sorry. what you seem
to be saying is

1137
00:34:26.981 --> 00:34:28.314
clear, Robert, sorry. What you seem
to be saying is therefore if we had

1138
00:34:28.314 --> 00:34:31.064
to be saying is therefore if we had
tested more widely earlier, we would

1139
00:34:31.064 --> 00:34:31.397
tested more widely eartier, we would
have

1140
00:34:31.397 --> 00:34:34.022
tested more widely earlier, we would
have fewer deaths now? I think that

1141
00:34:34.022 --> 00:34:37.772
have fewer deaths now? I think that
is what you are saying? I am

1142
00:34:37.772 --> 00:34:39.147
is what you are saying? I am
explaining why the German death rate

1143
00:34:39.147 --> 00:34:39.731
explaining why the German death rate
is as it

1144
00:34:39.731 --> 00:34:43.147
explaining why the German death rate
knﬂh

1145
00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:44.939
explaining why the German death rate
is as it is. It is very invidious

1146
00:34:44.939 --> 00:34:47.689
is as it is. It is very invidious
task for anybody at the moment to

1147
00:34:47.689 --> 00:34:48.397
task for anybody at the moment to
make direct international

1148
00:34:48.397 --> 00:34:50.481
make direct international
comparisons because we all came out

1149
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:52.397
comparisons because we all came out
this at different times, we have all

1150
00:34:52.397 --> 00:34:54.064
this at different times, we have all
taken slightly different approaches

1151
00:34:54.064 --> 00:34:56.147
taken slightly different approaches
and therefore you are comparing

1152
00:34:56.147 --> 00:34:57.897
and therefore you are comparing
apples with peers. There is no doubt

1153
00:34:57.897 --> 00:34:58.356
apples with pears. There is no doubt
we ran

1154
00:34:58.356 --> 00:35:00.314
apples with peers. There is no doubt
we can learn a lot from other

1155
00:35:00.314 --> 00:35:00.731
we ran learn a lot from other
countries,

1156
00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.939
we can learn a lot from other
countries, we’re watching very

1157
00:35:01.939 --> 00:35:03.606
countries, we’re watching very
carefully what actions and steps are

1158
00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:06.731
carefully what actions and steps are
being taken across Europe, no doubt

1159
00:35:06.731 --> 00:35:08.397
being taken across Europe, no doubt
about that. But the particular

1160
00:35:08.397 --> 00:35:10.189
about that. But the particular
approach will have to be tailored to

1161
00:35:10.189 --> 00:35:12.106
approach will have to be tailored to
domestic need and what we are facing

1162
00:35:12.106 --> 00:35:17.231
domestic need and what we are facing
here in the UK. I actually think the

1163
00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:18.731
here in the UK. I actually think the
opposite in some respects. I think

1164
00:35:18.731 --> 00:35:20.481
opposite in some respects. I think
the international comparison between

1165
00:35:20.481 --> 00:35:22.606
the international comparison between
what has happened here in the UK and

1166
00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:24.481
what has happened here in the UK and
Germany is very revealing indeed. We

1167
00:35:24.481 --> 00:35:27.106
Germany is very revealing indeed. We
know that the first cases appeared

1168
00:35:27.106 --> 00:35:27.897
know that the first rases appeared
in Germany

1169
00:35:27.897 --> 00:35:29.939
know that the first cases appeared
in Germany and the UK at almost

1170
00:35:29.939 --> 00:35:32.397
in Germany and the UK at almost
exactly the same time. However,

1171
00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:34.022
exactly the same time. However,
Germany introduced its most

1172
00:35:34.022 --> 00:35:35.189
Germany introduced its most
stringent lockdown measures a full

1173
00:35:35.189 --> 00:35:36.856
stringent lockdown measures a full
week, just over a week before the

1174
00:35:36.856 --> 00:35:40.731
week, just over a week before the
UK. So

1175
00:35:40.731 --> 00:35:41.772
week, just over a week before the
UK. 50 that we can is absolutely

1176
00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:41.981
UK. So that we ran is absolutely
critical

1177
00:35:41.981 --> 00:35:43.397
UK. 50 that we can is absolutely
critical and it will take a long

1178
00:35:43.397 --> 00:35:45.356
critical and it will take a long
time to find out precisely how

1179
00:35:45.356 --> 00:35:47.106
time to find out precisely how
important that was in overall

1180
00:35:47.106 --> 00:35:48.189
important that was in overall
numbers of deaths and transmission

1181
00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:50.564
numbers of deaths and transmission
that could have been avoided, at a

1182
00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:53.356
that could have been avoided, at a
time when we were still allowing the

1183
00:35:53.356 --> 00:35:54.606
time when we were still allowing the
Cheltenham horse racing festival to

1184
00:35:54.606 --> 00:35:54.897
Cheltenham horse racing festival to
go

1185
00:35:54.897 --> 00:35:56.481
Cheltenham horse racing festivth
go ahead

1186
00:35:56.481 --> 00:35:57.522
Cheltenham horse racing festival to
go ahead where 250,000 people

1187
00:35:57.522 --> 00:36:00.439
go ahead where 250,000 people
crammed themselves into the stands.

1188
00:36:00.439 --> 00:36:01.939
crammed themselves into the stands.
That is one important comparison.

1189
00:36:01.939 --> 00:36:05.147
That is one important comparison.
The other is, yes, Germany has a

1190
00:36:05.147 --> 00:36:06.522
The other is, yes, Germany has a
much better developed pharmaceutical

1191
00:36:06.522 --> 00:36:09.231
much better developed pharmaceutical
industry, everybody agrees on that.

1192
00:36:09.231 --> 00:36:11.647
industry, everybody agrees on that.
But also, the amount of money

1193
00:36:11.647 --> 00:36:14.189
But also, the amount of money
Germany spends per capita on health

1194
00:36:14.189 --> 00:36:14.522
Germany spends per rapita on health
is significantly

1195
00:36:14.522 --> 00:36:15.439
Germany spends per capita on health
is significantly different than the

1196
00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.897
is significantly different than the
UK. So

1197
00:36:16.897 --> 00:36:20.939
is significantly different than the
UK. 50 here in the NHS, we spend

1198
00:36:20.939 --> 00:36:21.481
UK. So here in the NHS, we spend
£3000 per

1199
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:22.856
UK. 50 here in the NHS, we spend
£3000 per capita in the UK on

1200
00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:24.022
£3000 per rapita in the UK on
health.

1201
00:36:24.022 --> 00:36:26.981
£3000 per capita in the UK on
health. In Germany, that figure is

1202
00:36:26.981 --> 00:36:28.356
health. In Germany, that figure is
SO%

1203
00:36:28.356 --> 00:36:29.981
health. In Germany, that figure is
5096 higher, it

1204
00:36:29.981 --> 00:36:31.231
health. In Germany, that figure is
50% higher, it is £4500 per capita.

1205
00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:32.189
5096 higher, it is £4500 per rapita.
So go figure,

1206
00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:33.314
50% higher, it is £4500 per capita.
So go figure, you have a starting

1207
00:36:33.314 --> 00:36:35.481
So go figure, you have a starting
point that is 50% more capacity in

1208
00:36:35.481 --> 00:36:36.439
point that is 5096 more capacity in
how you are

1209
00:36:36.439 --> 00:36:37.606
point that is 50% more capacity in
how you are going to manage this

1210
00:36:37.606 --> 00:36:39.147
how you are going to manage this
crisis. So

1211
00:36:39.147 --> 00:36:40.314
how you are going to manage this
crisis. 50 there is a lesson there

1212
00:36:40.314 --> 00:36:41.439
crisis. So there is a lesson there
in terms of

1213
00:36:41.439 --> 00:36:41.606
crisis. 50 there is a lesson there
in terms of how

1214
00:36:41.606 --> 00:36:41.856
crisis. 50 there is a lesson there
in terms of howl

1215
00:36:41.856 --> 00:36:42.522
crisis. 50 there is a lesson there
in terms of how I would suggest we

1216
00:36:42.522 --> 00:36:44.397
in terms of how I would suggest we
fund our health service, because we

1217
00:36:44.397 --> 00:36:46.106
fund our health service, because we
would be better able to manage the

1218
00:36:46.106 --> 00:36:48.564
would be better able to manage the
pandemic if we had a stronger

1219
00:36:48.564 --> 00:36:50.897
pandemic if we had a stronger
starting point. On the point of

1220
00:36:50.897 --> 00:36:52.772
starting point. On the point of
testing, there is another crucial

1221
00:36:52.772 --> 00:36:54.272
testing, there is another crucial
difference between Germany and the

1222
00:36:54.272 --> 00:36:56.939
difference between Germany and the
UK. That is, to begin with our

1223
00:36:56.939 --> 00:36:59.606
UK. That is, to begin with our
strategy was broadly the same, it

1224
00:36:59.606 --> 00:37:02.106
strategy was broadly the same, it
was to test every case and

1225
00:37:02.106 --> 00:37:02.439
was to test every rase and
rigorously

1226
00:37:02.439 --> 00:37:04.231
was to test every case and
rigorously contact race. 50 the

1227
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:04.397
rigorously contact race. 50 the
moment

1228
00:37:04.397 --> 00:37:05.897
rigorously contact race. So the
moment you identified a case, you

1229
00:37:05.897 --> 00:37:06.147
moment you identified a use, you
trace

1230
00:37:06.147 --> 00:37:07.939
moment you identified a case, you
trace everybody else, you shut them

1231
00:37:07.939 --> 00:37:11.064
trace everybody else, you shut them
down and self isolated them to try

1232
00:37:11.064 --> 00:37:12.314
down and self isolated them to try
and stop transmission. There was a

1233
00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:14.981
and stop transmission. There was a
point of course in the UK, at which

1234
00:37:14.981 --> 00:37:17.606
point of course in the UK, at which
the government changed strategy. On

1235
00:37:17.606 --> 00:37:20.606
the government changed strategy. On
the basis of the advice they were

1236
00:37:20.606 --> 00:37:21.522
the basis of the advice they were
given, to abandon testing and

1237
00:37:21.522 --> 00:37:25.064
given, to abandon testing and
contract testing in the community

1238
00:37:25.064 --> 00:37:28.481
contract testing in the community
with many epidemiologists would

1239
00:37:28.481 --> 00:37:31.147
with many epidemiologists would
argue with pretty catastrophic fall.

00:37:31.147 --> 00:37:31.356
argue with pretty catastrophic fall.

pandemic when testing every rase is
not an

1248
00:37:40.814 --> 00:37:46.064
pandemic when testing every case is
not an intervention. Yes, it was

not an intervention. Yes, it was
Jenny

not an intervention. Yes, it was
Jenny Harris who said that. Was that

1252
00:37:48.689 --> 00:37:51.439
jenny Harris who said that. Was that
right? I

1253
00:37:51.439 --> 00:37:52.397
jenny Harris who said that. Was that
right? Iwould

1254
00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:53.856
Jenny Harris who said that. Was that
right? I would defer to the World

1255
00:37:53.856 --> 00:37:57.439
right? I would defer to the World
Health Organization on this, I am

1256
00:37:57.439 --> 00:37:58.606
Health Organization on this, I am
not an epidemiologist. But the World

1257
00:37:58.606 --> 00:37:59.939
not an epidemiologist. But the World
Health Organization have been clear,

1258
00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:04.606
Health Organization have been clear,
the way you address any infectious

1259
00:38:04.606 --> 00:38:06.772
the way you address any infectious
outbreak is test, test, test. It is

1260
00:38:06.772 --> 00:38:09.189
outbreak is test, test, test. It is
one of the most important measures

1261
00:38:09.189 --> 00:38:09.731
one of the most important measures
you ran take.

1262
00:38:09.731 --> 00:38:13.856
one of the most important measures
you can take. That is what happens

1263
00:38:13.856 --> 00:38:14.564
you ran take. That is what happens
in Ebola, for

1264
00:38:14.564 --> 00:38:16.647
you can take. That is what happens
in Ebola, for instance and in China

1265
00:38:16.647 --> 00:38:19.606
in Ebola, for instance and in China
and many other countries. And I

1266
00:38:19.606 --> 00:38:21.814
and many other countries. And I
would exercise a note of caution, it

1267
00:38:21.814 --> 00:38:25.064
would exercise a note of caution, it
may be your test was a very good

1268
00:38:25.064 --> 00:38:29.064
may be your test was a very good
test, but I think Chris Whitty, the

1269
00:38:29.064 --> 00:38:29.314
test, but I think Chris whitty, the
Chief

1270
00:38:29.314 --> 00:38:31.481
test, but I think Chris Whitty, the
Chief Medical Officer and Patrick

1271
00:38:31.481 --> 00:38:32.481
Chief Medical Officer and Patrick
Vallance, the

1272
00:38:32.481 --> 00:38:33.147
Chief Medical Officer and Patrick
Valiance, the chief scientific

1273
00:38:33.147 --> 00:38:33.314
Vallance, the chief scientific
officer,

1274
00:38:33.314 --> 00:38:35.356
Valiance, the chief scientific
officer, are absolutely right when

1275
00:38:35.356 --> 00:38:37.314
officer, are absolutely right when
they stress caution about diving in

1276
00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:39.439
they stress caution about diving in
and starting to mass produce a test

1277
00:38:39.439 --> 00:38:42.231
and starting to mass produce a test
where we actually have not

1278
00:38:42.231 --> 00:38:43.106
where we actually have not
rigorously, scientifically validated

1279
00:38:43.106 --> 00:38:48.022
rigorously, scientifically validated
it. The one I am talking about, the

1280
00:38:48.022 --> 00:38:51.981
it. The one I am talking about, the
one that is required in large

1281
00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:54.231
one that is required in large
volumes, the want to see if you have

1282
00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.356
volumes, the want to see if you have
got it, one company is ready to

1283
00:38:56.356 --> 00:38:56.564
got it, one company is ready to
sunplv

1284
00:38:56.564 --> 00:38:57.939
got it, one company is ready to
supply1 million a week who have

1285
00:38:57.939 --> 00:38:58.106
supply1 million a week who have
been

1286
00:38:58.106 --> 00:38:59.731
supplyi million a week who have
been accredited around the world.

1287
00:38:59.731 --> 00:38:59.939
been accredited around the world.
Why

1288
00:38:59.939 --> 00:39:00.147
been accredited around the world.
why aren’t

1289
00:39:00.147 --> 00:39:01.481
been accredited around the world.
Why aren’t these tests are being

1290
00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:01.564
why aren’t these tests are being
made

1291
00:39:01.564 --> 00:39:04.106
Why aren’t these tests are being
made available. They can be tested,

1292
00:39:04.106 --> 00:39:05.481
made available. They ran be tested,
if they don’t

1293
00:39:05.481 --> 00:39:06.231
made available. They can be tested,
if they don’t have the virus, they

1294
00:39:06.231 --> 00:39:06.897
if they don’t have the virus, they
ran go into

1295
00:39:06.897 --> 00:39:08.106
if they don’t have the virus, they
can go into work. We should have

1296
00:39:08.106 --> 00:39:09.106
ran go into work. We should have
that testing

1297
00:39:09.106 --> 00:39:12.647
can go into work. We should have
that testing capability. Lisa, you

1298
00:39:12.647 --> 00:39:14.856
that testing capability. Lisa, you
have been listening very patiently,

1299
00:39:14.856 --> 00:39:16.731
have been listening very patiently,
so I find it very extraordinary to

1300
00:39:16.731 --> 00:39:18.439
so I find it very extraordinary to
have somebody in the studio who has

1301
00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:21.147
have somebody in the studio who has
had an antibody test knowing the

1302
00:39:21.147 --> 00:39:22.897
had an antibody test knowing the
Prime Minister has been saying, this

1303
00:39:22.897 --> 00:39:25.314
Prime Minister has been saying, this
is the holy Grail and someone has

1304
00:39:25.314 --> 00:39:27.814
is the holy Grail and someone has
had one from Germany. The question

1305
00:39:27.814 --> 00:39:30.356
had one from Germany. The question
is very specific, did the government

1306
00:39:30.356 --> 00:39:32.647
is very specific, did the government
failed to act for two months because

1307
00:39:32.647 --> 00:39:35.022
failed to act for two months because
we knew we couldn’t respond the same

1308
00:39:35.022 --> 00:39:36.814
we knew we couldn’t respond the same
as Germany, we didn’t have the

1309
00:39:36.814 --> 00:39:38.897
as Germany, we didn’t have the
wherewithal, what is your response?

1310
00:39:38.897 --> 00:39:41.939
wherewithal, what is your response?
The honest answer is, we don’t know.

1311
00:39:41.939 --> 00:39:43.772
The honest answer is, we don’t know.
And while we will have to unpick

1312
00:39:43.772 --> 00:39:43.897
And whila we will have to unpick
what

1313
00:39:43.897 --> 00:39:45.147
And while we will have to unpick
what has happened and what has gone

1314
00:39:45.147 --> 00:39:47.147
what has happened and what has gone
wrong when this is over, we have an

1315
00:39:47.147 --> 00:39:49.606
wrong when this is over, we have an
immediate crisis we are trying to

1316
00:39:49.606 --> 00:39:50.606
immediate crisis we are trying to
deal with.

1317
00:39:50.606 --> 00:39:50.772
immediate crisis we are trying to
dealwith. It

1318
00:39:50.772 --> 00:39:51.647
immediate crisis we are trying to
deal with. It is widely acknowledged

1319
00:39:51.647 --> 00:39:53.814
deal with. It is widely acknowledged
we were too slow to recognise the

1320
00:39:53.814 --> 00:39:54.397
we were too slow to recognise the
stale

1321
00:39:54.397 --> 00:39:56.147
we were too slow to recognise the
scale of the problem and to

1322
00:39:56.147 --> 00:39:58.481
scale of the problem and to
implement lockdown and there was

1323
00:39:58.481 --> 00:39:59.606
implement lockdown and there was
real confusion at the outset, about

1324
00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:01.814
real confusion at the outset, about
what the government’s strategy was.

1325
00:40:01.814 --> 00:40:03.689
what the government’s strategy was.
There were suggestions in the media

1326
00:40:03.689 --> 00:40:05.897
There were suggestions in the media
they were pursuing a strategy of

1327
00:40:05.897 --> 00:40:07.314
they were pursuing a strategy of
herd immunity where people would get

1328
00:40:07.314 --> 00:40:08.439
herd immunity where peopla would get
it and

1329
00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.481
herd immunity where people would get
it and then the population would

1330
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:12.439
it and then the population would
become immune. Labour was very

1331
00:40:12.439 --> 00:40:12.856
become immune. labour was very
supportive of

1332
00:40:12.856 --> 00:40:13.522
become immune. Labour was very
supportive of the strategy,

1333
00:40:13.522 --> 00:40:17.439
supportive of the strategy,
certainly at the very beginning? We

1334
00:40:17.439 --> 00:40:19.647
certainly at the very beginning? We
were pushing quite hard for lockdown

1335
00:40:19.647 --> 00:40:21.939
were pushing quite hard for lockdown
before it happened. I think it was

1336
00:40:21.939 --> 00:40:23.689
before it happened. I think it was
becoming apparent from other

1337
00:40:23.689 --> 00:40:26.564
becoming apparent from other
countries, as well from the UK, that

1338
00:40:26.564 --> 00:40:28.522
countries, as well from the UK, that
was important and people were being

1339
00:40:28.522 --> 00:40:30.439
was important and people were being
put at risk. If you remember, it

1340
00:40:30.439 --> 00:40:30.522
put at risk. If you remember, it
took

1341
00:40:30.522 --> 00:40:30.856
put at risk. If you remember, it
tookjeremy

1342
00:40:30.856 --> 00:40:32.897
put at risk. If you remember, it
tookJeremy Hunt to come out and

1343
00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:33.897
tookjeremy Hunt to come out and
push the

1344
00:40:33.897 --> 00:40:34.814
tookJeremy Hunt to come out and
push the government on contact

1345
00:40:34.814 --> 00:40:36.439
push the government on contact
tracing and testing before we

1346
00:40:36.439 --> 00:40:38.814
tracing and testing before we
started to get some action. The

1347
00:40:38.814 --> 00:40:41.897
started to get some action. The
thing that is important now, broadly

1348
00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:43.647
thing that is important now, broadly
speaking the government has accepted

1349
00:40:43.647 --> 00:40:47.564
speaking the government has accepted
how important this is and is doing,

1350
00:40:47.564 --> 00:40:48.606
how important this is and is doing,
I believe sincerely, everything they

1351
00:40:48.606 --> 00:40:49.939
I believe sincerely, everything they
ran to try to

1352
00:40:49.939 --> 00:40:51.731
I believe sincerely, everything they
can to try to get access to those

1353
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:52.147
ran to try to get access to those
tests.

1354
00:40:52.147 --> 00:40:54.397
can to try to get access to those
tests. Matt Hancock set a target of

1355
00:40:54.397 --> 00:40:55.772
tests. Matt Hancock set a target of
100,000 tests which will have to be

1356
00:40:55.772 --> 00:40:57.397
100,000 tests which will have to be
hit in a couple of weeks and it

1357
00:40:57.397 --> 00:40:58.981
hit in a couple of weeks and it
doesn’t look, from the figures that

1358
00:40:58.981 --> 00:40:59.064
doesn’t look, from the figures that
name

1359
00:40:59.064 --> 00:41:00.897
doesn’t look, from the figures that
came out this week, that we are

1360
00:41:00.897 --> 00:41:02.814
came out this week, that we are
anywhere near of making progress on

1361
00:41:02.814 --> 00:41:05.231
anywhere near of making progress on
those things as we should be. I

1362
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:06.981
those things as we should be. I
think it is really important that we

1363
00:41:06.981 --> 00:41:09.147
think it is really important that we
have a much bigger and renewed focus

1364
00:41:09.147 --> 00:41:13.272
have a much bigger and renewed focus
on that. But I would also just take

1365
00:41:13.272 --> 00:41:16.189
on that. But I would also just take
you back to this point about having

1366
00:41:16.189 --> 00:41:18.897
you back to this point about having
a better understanding and a more

1367
00:41:18.897 --> 00:41:21.147
a better understanding and a more
honest assessment and appraisal from

1368
00:41:21.147 --> 00:41:22.772
honest assessment and appraisal from
government about their strategy to

1369
00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:24.731
government about their strategy to
move the country on from this moment

1370
00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:27.272
move the country on from this moment
when it is safe and appropriate to

1371
00:41:27.272 --> 00:41:29.106
when it is safe and appropriate to
do so. Because there is a concern

1372
00:41:29.106 --> 00:41:33.189
do so. Because there is a concern
about the antibody tests that has

1373
00:41:33.189 --> 00:41:35.606
about the antibody tests that has
been raised by a number of

1374
00:41:35.606 --> 00:41:37.231
been raised by a number of
behavioural scientist, with people

1375
00:41:37.231 --> 00:41:37.481
behavioural scientist, with peopla
under

1376
00:41:37.481 --> 00:41:39.439
behavioural scientist, with people
under financial pressure to return

1377
00:41:39.439 --> 00:41:42.356
under financial pressure to return
to work, you could end up with a

1378
00:41:42.356 --> 00:41:43.522
to work, you could end up with a
situation where people felt pressure

1379
00:41:43.522 --> 00:41:45.689
situation where people felt pressure
to go and get the virus in order

1380
00:41:45.689 --> 00:41:47.856
to go and get the virus in order
they could go and get on with their

1381
00:41:47.856 --> 00:41:49.481
they could go and get on with their
lives. I don’t think most people

1382
00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:49.564
lives. I don’t think most peopla
would

1383
00:41:49.564 --> 00:41:52.064
lives. I don’t think most people
would do that, but I think we have

1384
00:41:52.064 --> 00:41:54.397
would do that, but I think we have
to be really, really careful about

1385
00:41:54.397 --> 00:41:55.772
to be really, really careful about
how we communicate with the public

1386
00:41:55.772 --> 00:41:58.689
how we communicate with the public
about how we are going to get out of

1387
00:41:58.689 --> 00:42:01.272
about how we are going to get out of
this crisis. Otherwise you could

1388
00:42:01.272 --> 00:42:02.231
this crisis. Otherwise you could
have unintended consequences and

1389
00:42:02.231 --> 00:42:04.897
have unintended consequences and
that’s why the government needs to

1390
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:06.939
that’s why the government needs to
be much, much clearer about when

1391
00:42:06.939 --> 00:42:09.897
be much, much clearer about when
they anticipate we are going with

1392
00:42:09.897 --> 00:42:10.897
they anticipate we are going with
this. I

1393
00:42:10.897 --> 00:42:11.106
they anticipate we are going with
this. Iaccept

1394
00:42:11.106 --> 00:42:12.647
they anticipate we are going with
this. I accept this is a moving

1395
00:42:12.647 --> 00:42:14.064
this. I accept this is a moving
thing that moves very fast and we

1396
00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:17.189
thing that moves very fast and we
are going to have to respond to the

1397
00:42:17.189 --> 00:42:18.564
are going to have to respond to the
science and adjust the strategy

1398
00:42:18.564 --> 00:42:19.814
science and adjust the strategy
accordingly, but we have got to be

1399
00:42:19.814 --> 00:42:21.356
accordingly, but we have got to be
more open with the public about what

1400
00:42:21.356 --> 00:42:26.064
more open with the public about what
we are doing and why. Lisa makes a

1401
00:42:26.064 --> 00:42:29.606
we are doing and why. Lisa makes a
point about behaviour. That is what

1402
00:42:29.606 --> 00:42:32.147
point about behaviour. That is what
Sage will be doing, they will be

1403
00:42:32.147 --> 00:42:33.522
Sage will be doing, they will be
understanding that before they

1404
00:42:33.522 --> 00:42:34.856
understanding that before they
advise the government. All the

1405
00:42:34.856 --> 00:42:36.231
advise the government. All the
things being talked about are being

1406
00:42:36.231 --> 00:42:38.064
things being talked about are being
done but we want to make sure we are

1407
00:42:38.064 --> 00:42:40.772
done but we want to make sure we are
in a position to make sure we have a

1408
00:42:40.772 --> 00:42:43.481
in a position to make sure we have a
much more conclusive picture. The

1409
00:42:43.481 --> 00:42:45.439
much more conclusive picture. The
question is about testing, Robert.

1410
00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:47.606
question is about testing, Robert.
The government or Matt Hancock has

1411
00:42:47.606 --> 00:42:50.606
The government or Matt Hancock has
committed to 100,000 tests a day in

1412
00:42:50.606 --> 00:42:54.647
committed to 100,000 tests a day in
a four night. We are currently at

1413
00:42:54.647 --> 00:42:55.689
a four night. We are currently at
35,000 capacity. —— fortnight.

1414
00:42:55.689 --> 00:42:57.397
35,000 capacity. -- fortnight.
Nothing like

1415
00:42:57.397 --> 00:42:58.647
35,000 capacity. —— fortnight.
Nothing like that is being carried

1416
00:42:58.647 --> 00:43:01.856
Nothing like that is being carried
out. Only two weeks to go, are you

1417
00:43:01.856 --> 00:43:04.356
out. Only two weeks to go, are you
going to do it? It is a big

1418
00:43:04.356 --> 00:43:04.481
going to do it? It is a big
challange,

1419
00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:06.939
going to do it? It is a big
challenge, but look at how far we

1420
00:43:06.939 --> 00:43:07.314
challange, but look at how far we
have

1421
00:43:07.314 --> 00:43:08.564
challenge, but look at how far we
have come already. Matt Hancock is

1422
00:43:08.564 --> 00:43:09.939
have come already. Matt Hancock is
confident that with the partnerships

1423
00:43:09.939 --> 00:43:11.856
confident that with the partnerships
we have now set

1424
00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:12.064
confident that with the partnerships
we have now setup,

1425
00:43:12.064 --> 00:43:12.564
confident that with the partnerships
we have now set up, we can

1426
00:43:12.564 --> 00:43:13.147
confident that with the partnerships
we have now setup, we can do that.

1427
00:43:13.147 --> 00:43:13.689
we have now set up, we ran do that.
Look how far

1428
00:43:13.689 --> 00:43:15.064
we have now setup, we can do that.
Look how far we have come in six

1429
00:43:15.064 --> 00:43:18.147
Look how far we have come in six
weeks. We have achieved huge strides

1430
00:43:18.147 --> 00:43:20.189
weeks. We have achieved huge strides
in terms of the way we are tackling

1431
00:43:20.189 --> 00:43:27.272
in terms of the way we are tackling
this. How are you going to get to

1432
00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:29.981
this. How are you going to get to
that target? We have to be ambitious

1433
00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:32.106
that target? We have to be ambitious
and it would be mealy—mouthed of us

1434
00:43:32.106 --> 00:43:33.147
and it would be meaty-mouthed of us
to say it would

1435
00:43:33.147 --> 00:43:35.981
and it would be mealy—mouthed of us
to say it would be easy to hit. Do

1436
00:43:35.981 --> 00:43:37.689
to say it would be easy to hit. Do
you have some expectation of meeting

1437
00:43:37.689 --> 00:43:40.314
you have some expectation of meeting
it? We have to set a target that is

1438
00:43:40.314 --> 00:43:42.106
it? We have to set a target that is
a challenge. It is a huge challenge

1439
00:43:42.106 --> 00:43:43.689
a challenge. It is a huge challenge
and we have set that to the

1440
00:43:43.689 --> 00:43:45.022
and we have set that to the
community who deal with this and we

1441
00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:47.397
community who deal with this and we
are confident we can get there. We

1442
00:43:47.397 --> 00:43:48.106
are confident we ran get there. We
are making very

1443
00:43:48.106 --> 00:43:48.731
are confident we can get there. We
are making very good progress. We

1444
00:43:48.731 --> 00:43:50.856
are making very good progress. We
will be back in two weeks and we

1445
00:43:50.856 --> 00:43:53.689
will be back in two weeks and we
will find out. Let’s take a question

1446
00:43:53.689 --> 00:43:56.897
will find out. Let’s take a question
from Richard Clarke. The UK started

1447
00:43:56.897 --> 00:44:01.147
from Richard Clarke. The UK started
wearing facemasks, in countries like

1448
00:44:01.147 --> 00:44:01.439
wearing facemasks, in countries like
japan,

1449
00:44:01.439 --> 00:44:02.856
wearing facemasks, in countries like
Japan, Singapore and China, the

1450
00:44:02.856 --> 00:44:03.981
japan, Singapore and China, the
death

1451
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:05.064
Japan, Singapore and China, the
death rate from this virus is

1452
00:44:05.064 --> 00:44:08.272
death rate from this virus is
significantly less than it is here.

1453
00:44:08.272 --> 00:44:09.856
significantly less than it is here.
Facemasks have proven to help stop

1454
00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:11.606
Facemasks have proven to help stop
the spread of this virus onto

1455
00:44:11.606 --> 00:44:13.647
the spread of this virus onto
someone else, so why aren’t we using

1456
00:44:13.647 --> 00:44:15.981
someone else, so why aren’t we using
them? It may be awhile before

1457
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:18.856
them? It may be awhile before
restrictions are eased in the UK so

1458
00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:22.522
restrictions are eased in the UK so
would this be a good time to ask a

1459
00:44:22.522 --> 00:44:22.856
would this be a good time to ask a
[oral clothing

1460
00:44:22.856 --> 00:44:24.439
would this be a good time to ask a
local clothing manufacture, a lot of

1461
00:44:24.439 --> 00:44:25.439
[oral clothing manufacture, a lot of
them in

1462
00:44:25.439 --> 00:44:25.814
local clothing manufacture, a lot of
them in Wolverhampton, to

1463
00:44:25.814 --> 00:44:27.939
them in Wolverhampton, to
manufacture as many facemasks as

1464
00:44:27.939 --> 00:44:28.272
manufacture as many facemasks as
possibla and

1465
00:44:28.272 --> 00:44:30.731
manufacture as many facemasks as
possible and post them to households

1466
00:44:30.731 --> 00:44:30.856
possibla and post them to households
in

1467
00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:32.897
possible and post them to households
in the region. It could provide a

1468
00:44:32.897 --> 00:44:34.606
in the region. It could provide a
possible shortage issue further down

1469
00:44:34.606 --> 00:44:37.647
possible shortage issue further down
the line. Should we be wearing

1470
00:44:37.647 --> 00:44:40.564
the line. Should we be wearing
facemasks, Rachel? It is a very

1471
00:44:40.564 --> 00:44:42.689
facemasks, Rachel? It is a very
interesting question. The W still

1472
00:44:42.689 --> 00:44:42.856
interesting question. The w still
5575

1473
00:44:42.856 --> 00:44:43.397
interesting question. The w still
says no, their

1474
00:44:43.397 --> 00:44:45.022
interesting question. The W still
says no, their advice is not to

1475
00:44:45.022 --> 00:44:46.522
says no, their advice is not to
recommend that general members of

1476
00:44:46.522 --> 00:44:48.147
recommend that general members of
the public should wear face masks.

1477
00:44:48.147 --> 00:44:51.147
the public should wear face masks.
They have some very good reasons for

1478
00:44:51.147 --> 00:44:53.064
They have some very good reasons for
concern. If you wear a mask, you are

1479
00:44:53.064 --> 00:44:55.147
concern. If you wear a mask, you are
more likely to touch your face and

1480
00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:57.397
more likely to touch your face and
we know one of the main routes of

1481
00:44:57.397 --> 00:44:58.897
we know one of the main routes of
transmission of this virus of

1482
00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:00.606
transmission of this virus of
infection is, you have picked it up

1483
00:45:00.606 --> 00:45:03.606
infection is, you have picked it up
on your hands and then you touch

1484
00:45:03.606 --> 00:45:05.022
on your hands and then you touch
either your nose, your eyes or your

1485
00:45:05.022 --> 00:45:07.522
either your nose, your eyes or your
mouth. If you have something across

1486
00:45:07.522 --> 00:45:09.856
mouth. If you have something across
your face that invites you to touch

1487
00:45:09.856 --> 00:45:11.064
your face that invites you to touch
your face, it potentially increases

1488
00:45:11.064 --> 00:45:14.189
your face, it potentially increases
the risk of you infecting yourself.

1489
00:45:14.189 --> 00:45:15.439
the risk of you infecting yourself.
There is another behavioural issue

1490
00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:18.189
There is another behavioural issue
here which is the perception, if you

1491
00:45:18.189 --> 00:45:20.147
here which is the perception, if you
are wearing a mask you are somehow

1492
00:45:20.147 --> 00:45:23.939
are wearing a mask you are somehow
more protected so you may be more

1493
00:45:23.939 --> 00:45:24.814
more protected so you may be more
inclined to undertake riskier

1494
00:45:24.814 --> 00:45:26.397
inclined to undertake riskier
behaviours. You may not socially

1495
00:45:26.397 --> 00:45:28.606
behaviours. You may not socially
distance in the same way you would

1496
00:45:28.606 --> 00:45:31.647
distance in the same way you would
otherwise. There are some real

1497
00:45:31.647 --> 00:45:32.689
otherwise. There are some real
concerns around facemasks. The flip

1498
00:45:32.689 --> 00:45:34.939
concerns around facemasks. The ﬂip
side of

1499
00:45:34.939 --> 00:45:38.981
concerns around facemasks. The flip
side of that is, there is no

1500
00:45:38.981 --> 00:45:42.439
side of that is, there is no
randomised control trial evidence

1501
00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:45.231
randomised control trial evidence
for whether or not facemasks are

1502
00:45:45.231 --> 00:45:48.606
for whether or not facemasks are
beneficial or not in the case of

1503
00:45:48.606 --> 00:45:49.647
beneficial or not in the use of
coronavims,

1504
00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:50.647
beneficial or not in the case of
coronavirus, Covid—19 specifically.

1505
00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:51.272
coronavims, Covid-19 specifically.
We do

1506
00:45:51.272 --> 00:45:52.856
coronavirus, Covid—19 specifically.
We do have some evidence for other

1507
00:45:52.856 --> 00:45:56.356
We do have some evidence for other
viruses, but not this virus. Lots of

1508
00:45:56.356 --> 00:45:56.439
viruses, but not this vims. Lots of
countries

1509
00:45:56.439 --> 00:45:57.814
viruses, but not this virus. Lots of
countries are enforcing, Japan,

1510
00:45:57.814 --> 00:45:58.231
countries are enforcing, japan,
South

1511
00:45:58.231 --> 00:46:00.439
countries are enforcing, Japan,
South Korea, Hong Kong and then the

1512
00:46:00.439 --> 00:46:02.314
South Korea, Hong Kong and then the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany,

1513
00:46:02.314 --> 00:46:03.272
(‘zech Republic, Slovakia, Germany,
France, Spain

1514
00:46:03.272 --> 00:46:03.981
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany,
France, Spain they are all either

1515
00:46:03.981 --> 00:46:06.606
France, Spain they are all either
saying people have to wear them or

1516
00:46:06.606 --> 00:46:08.356
saying people have to wear them or
they are encouraging it. This is not

1517
00:46:08.356 --> 00:46:09.397
they are encouraging it. This is not
necessarily what the public assume

1518
00:46:09.397 --> 00:46:11.689
necessarily what the public assume
to be the case. There are two

1519
00:46:11.689 --> 00:46:11.897
to be the rase. There are two
reasons

1520
00:46:11.897 --> 00:46:13.856
to be the case. There are two
reasons for wearing a mask. One is

1521
00:46:13.856 --> 00:46:15.981
reasons for wearing a mask. One is
to decrease your risk of being

1522
00:46:15.981 --> 00:46:17.397
to decrease your risk of being
infected and the other is to

1523
00:46:17.397 --> 00:46:19.856
infected and the other is to
decrease your risk of infecting

1524
00:46:19.856 --> 00:46:23.022
decrease your risk of infecting
other people if you, unbeknownst to

1525
00:46:23.022 --> 00:46:23.647
other peopla if you, unbeknownst to
yourself, have

1526
00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:26.314
other people if you, unbeknownst to
yourself, have the virus. You may be

1527
00:46:26.314 --> 00:46:26.397
yourself, have the vims. You may be
asymptomatic.

1528
00:46:26.397 --> 00:46:27.272
yourself, have the virus. You may be
asymptomatic. You may unknowingly be

1529
00:46:27.272 --> 00:46:33.189
asymptomatic. You may unknowingly be
spreading it to other people.

1530
00:46:33.564 --> 00:46:35.814
A cloth mask is pretty rubbish as a

1531
00:46:35.814 --> 00:46:36.439
A doth mask is pretty rubbish as a
form of

1532
00:46:36.439 --> 00:46:37.272
A cloth mask is pretty rubbish as a
form of protection for you, against

1533
00:46:37.272 --> 00:46:37.689
form of protection for you, against
other peopla

1534
00:46:37.689 --> 00:46:39.689
form of protection for you, against
other people coughing virus

1535
00:46:39.689 --> 00:46:40.189
other peopla coughing virus
partidas

1536
00:46:40.189 --> 00:46:41.606
other people coughing virus
particles over you. It might help a

1537
00:46:41.606 --> 00:46:42.397
partidas over you. It might help a
little bit.

1538
00:46:42.397 --> 00:46:44.897
particles over you. It might help a
little bit. But in terms of use, if

1539
00:46:44.897 --> 00:46:46.481
little bit. But in terms of use, if
you are infected, protecting other

1540
00:46:46.481 --> 00:46:48.439
you are infected, protecting other
people from you transmitting the

1541
00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:48.856
peopla from you transmitting the
virus to

1542
00:46:48.856 --> 00:46:50.606
people from you transmitting the
virus to them, then actually there

1543
00:46:50.606 --> 00:46:53.856
virus to them, then actually there
is evidence that a cloth mask

1544
00:46:53.856 --> 00:46:55.272
is evidence that a cloth mask
reduces the amount of virus

1545
00:46:55.272 --> 00:47:03.272
reduces the amount of virus
particles that you are generating to

1546
00:47:03.272 --> 00:47:03.606
partidas that you are generating to
a 36th

1547
00:47:03.606 --> 00:47:06.606
particles that you are generating to
a 36th of what it would have been. I

1548
00:47:06.606 --> 00:47:08.439
a 36th of what it would have been. I
was listening to Patrick Valiance,

1549
00:47:08.439 --> 00:47:08.606
was listening to Patrick Vallance,
the

1550
00:47:08.606 --> 00:47:12.439
was listening to Patrick Valiance,
the chief scientific adviser on

1551
00:47:12.439 --> 00:47:13.772
the chief scientific adviser on
Monday, he said that masks don’t

1552
00:47:13.772 --> 00:47:15.231
Monday, he said that masks don’t
necessarily protect the general

1553
00:47:15.231 --> 00:47:17.606
necessarily protect the general
public, but they do help in stopping

1554
00:47:17.606 --> 00:47:19.481
public, but they do help in stopping
you transmitting it to others. That

1555
00:47:19.481 --> 00:47:19.939
you transmitting it to others. That
stmck me

1556
00:47:19.939 --> 00:47:22.439
you transmitting it to others. That
struck me come in a pandemic, as a

1557
00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.606
stmck me come in a pandemic, as a
pretty good thing

1558
00:47:23.606 --> 00:47:25.314
struck me come in a pandemic, as a
pretty good thing to aim for. What

1559
00:47:25.314 --> 00:47:25.939
pretty good thing to aim for. what
is the

1560
00:47:25.939 --> 00:47:27.522
pretty good thing to aim for. What
is the Labour view? Does Labour have

1561
00:47:27.522 --> 00:47:29.356
is the labour view? Does labour have
a view on

1562
00:47:29.356 --> 00:47:31.189
is the Labour view? Does Labour have
a view on masks? Well, I’m not a

1563
00:47:31.189 --> 00:47:32.897
a view on masks? Well, I’m not a
scientist. I would definitely be

1564
00:47:32.897 --> 00:47:35.939
scientist. I would definitely be
guided by people who are in terms of

1565
00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:38.397
guided by people who are in terms of
the advice that is given. This week,

1566
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:40.231
the advice that is given. This week,
we had a situation where the of New

1567
00:47:40.231 --> 00:47:41.606
we had a situation where the of New
York governor came out and said that

1568
00:47:41.606 --> 00:47:42.189
York governor came out and said that
peopla will only

1569
00:47:42.189 --> 00:47:44.606
York governor came out and said that
people will only be allowed out in

1570
00:47:44.606 --> 00:47:44.897
peopla will only be allowed out in
pub“:

1571
00:47:44.897 --> 00:47:45.106
peopla will only be allowed out in
public if

1572
00:47:45.106 --> 00:47:47.647
people will only be allowed out in
public if they are wearing face

1573
00:47:47.647 --> 00:47:49.981
public if they are wearing face
masks. That has caused a lot of

1574
00:47:49.981 --> 00:47:52.439
masks. That has caused a lot of
concern for people in this country,

1575
00:47:52.439 --> 00:47:53.064
concern for peoplc in this country,
many of whom

1576
00:47:53.064 --> 00:47:54.356
concern for people in this country,
many of whom are not on lockdown. I

1577
00:47:54.356 --> 00:47:56.397
many of whom are not on lockdown. I
know we keep talking about lockdown,

1578
00:47:56.397 --> 00:47:57.856
know we keep talking about lockdown,
but a lot of my constituents are

1579
00:47:57.856 --> 00:47:59.481
but a lot of my constituents are
still going out to work every day.

1580
00:47:59.481 --> 00:48:01.939
still going out to work every day.
Some of them are transport workers,

1581
00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:03.189
Some of them are transport workers,
they work in food production, as

1582
00:48:03.189 --> 00:48:07.564
they work in food production, as
well as the care sectors. But others

1583
00:48:07.564 --> 00:48:08.022
well as the rare sectors. But others
are simply

1584
00:48:08.022 --> 00:48:10.814
well as the care sectors. But others
are simply going to work in car part

1585
00:48:10.814 --> 00:48:11.231
are simply going to work in far part
companies or

1586
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:11.897
are simply going to work in car part
companies or construction sites.

1587
00:48:11.897 --> 00:48:12.856
companies or constmction sites.
They are

1588
00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:14.022
companies or construction sites.
They are going to work in

1589
00:48:14.022 --> 00:48:15.981
They are going to work in
warehouses, packing boxes for a

1590
00:48:15.981 --> 00:48:17.897
warehouses, packing boxes for a
minimum wage. And the number of

1591
00:48:17.897 --> 00:48:20.814
minimum wage. And the number of
reports I have had from employees in

1592
00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:22.606
reports I have had from employees in
those industries about employers who

1593
00:48:22.606 --> 00:48:23.606
those industries about employers who
are not following the government

1594
00:48:23.606 --> 00:48:25.272
are not following the government
guidance, they are not allowing

1595
00:48:25.272 --> 00:48:27.647
guidance, they are not allowing
their employees to work from home if

1596
00:48:27.647 --> 00:48:28.439
their employees to work from home if
they ran, they

1597
00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:30.814
their employees to work from home if
they can, they are not following and

1598
00:48:30.814 --> 00:48:30.981
they ran, they are not following and
enforcing

1599
00:48:30.981 --> 00:48:31.606
they can, they are not following and
enforcing social distance measures,

1600
00:48:31.606 --> 00:48:33.856
enforcing social distance measures,
and they are not putting in place

1601
00:48:33.856 --> 00:48:35.731
and they are not putting in place
proper hand washing facilities, they

1602
00:48:35.731 --> 00:48:37.106
proper hand washing facilities, they
are really, really worried about

1603
00:48:37.106 --> 00:48:39.106
are really, really worried about
these reports about face masks.

1604
00:48:39.106 --> 00:48:40.522
these reports about face masks.
Because a face masks are needed,

1605
00:48:40.522 --> 00:48:41.981
Because a face masks are needed,
they obviously need them. I think

1606
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:44.189
they obviously need them. I think
there is a couple of things that the

1607
00:48:44.189 --> 00:48:45.397
there is a couple of things that the
Government could do quickly. The

1608
00:48:45.397 --> 00:48:47.522
Government could do quickly. The
first is to provide a level of

1609
00:48:47.522 --> 00:48:49.022
first is to provide a level of
clarity about that, especially for

1610
00:48:49.022 --> 00:48:49.272
clarity about that, especially for
peopla

1611
00:48:49.272 --> 00:48:50.397
clarity about that, especially for
people that are going out and

1612
00:48:50.397 --> 00:48:51.064
peopla that are going out and
working on

1613
00:48:51.064 --> 00:48:51.897
people that are going out and
working on the front line. The

1614
00:48:51.897 --> 00:48:53.356
working on the front line. The
second thing that I think they could

1615
00:48:53.356 --> 00:48:55.606
second thing that I think they could
do as well is to take seriously this

1616
00:48:55.606 --> 00:48:59.481
do as well is to take seriously this
issue that there are many people

1617
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:00.189
issue that there are many people
whose employers are currently

1618
00:49:00.189 --> 00:49:01.606
whose employers are currently
putting them at risk. I think most

1619
00:49:01.606 --> 00:49:02.731
putting them at risk. I think most
businesses are trying to do the

1620
00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:06.564
businesses are trying to do the
right thing. But I have been

1621
00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:08.022
right thing. But I have been
overwhelmed reports from people

1622
00:49:08.022 --> 00:49:08.897
overwhelmed reports from people
across the north—west that are

1623
00:49:08.897 --> 00:49:09.356
across the north-west that are
dealing with

1624
00:49:09.356 --> 00:49:10.356
across the north—west that are
dealing with this, and I know that

1625
00:49:10.356 --> 00:49:12.022
dealing with this, and I know that
many mayors and council leaders have

1626
00:49:12.022 --> 00:49:14.772
many mayors and council leaders have
as well. I would urge the Government

1627
00:49:14.772 --> 00:49:17.439
as well. I would urge the Government
to take action to protect people. I

1628
00:49:17.439 --> 00:49:18.022
to take action to protect peopla. I
think Lisa

1629
00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:19.272
to take action to protect people. I
think Lisa makes a really good point

1630
00:49:19.272 --> 00:49:20.522
think Lisa makes a really good point
about the way that companies are

1631
00:49:20.522 --> 00:49:21.439
about the way that companies are
treating their employees at this

1632
00:49:21.439 --> 00:49:24.439
treating their employees at this
time. The test of leadership is not

1633
00:49:24.439 --> 00:49:26.897
time. The test of leadership is not
in good times, it’s in bad times. If

1634
00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.897
in good times, it’s in bad times. If
a company puts people first, that is

1635
00:49:28.897 --> 00:49:29.231
a company puts peopla first, that is
the most

1636
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:30.356
a company puts people first, that is
the most important thing, the safety

1637
00:49:30.356 --> 00:49:32.814
the most important thing, the safety
and welfare of their people. When it

1638
00:49:32.814 --> 00:49:33.439
and welfare of their people. when it
comes to

1639
00:49:33.439 --> 00:49:34.481
and welfare of their people. When it
comes to masks, I realised when I

1640
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:35.022
comes to masks, I realised when I
went to japan

1641
00:49:35.022 --> 00:49:36.106
comes to masks, I realised when I
went to Japan for the first time,

1642
00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:37.064
went to japan for the first time,
when I

1643
00:49:37.064 --> 00:49:38.189
went to Japan for the first time,
when I saw people wearing masks, I

1644
00:49:38.189 --> 00:49:38.814
when I saw peopla wearing masks, I
was then

1645
00:49:38.814 --> 00:49:39.439
when I saw people wearing masks, I
was then explained that actually,

1646
00:49:39.439 --> 00:49:42.439
was then explained that actually,
they want to stop you getting

1647
00:49:42.439 --> 00:49:45.814
they want to stop you getting
infected. So, that aspect of it...

1648
00:49:45.814 --> 00:49:48.439
infected. So, that aspect of it...
The debate has been about whether it

1649
00:49:48.439 --> 00:49:49.272
The debate has been about whether it
protect yourself, but Patrick

1650
00:49:49.272 --> 00:49:50.772
protect yourself, but Patrick
Vallance said it can stop the

1651
00:49:50.772 --> 00:49:51.522
Vallance said it can stop the
transmission. I thought,

1652
00:49:51.522 --> 00:49:51.689
Vallance said it can stop the
transmission. Ithought, surely,

1653
00:49:51.689 --> 00:49:57.231
transmission. Ithought, surely,
that’s worth having? I respect the

1654
00:49:57.231 --> 00:49:57.397
that’s worth having? I respect the
“Y

1655
00:49:57.397 --> 00:49:58.481
that’s worth having? I respect the
way the Government has been dealing

1656
00:49:58.481 --> 00:50:00.564
way the Government has been dealing
with this, they have been listening

1657
00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:02.231
with this, they have been listening
to the scientists, we have all been

1658
00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:03.814
to the scientists, we have all been
following what scientists advise us.

1659
00:50:03.814 --> 00:50:05.939
following what scientists advise us.
Maybe they will come round to saying

1660
00:50:05.939 --> 00:50:08.147
Maybe they will come round to saying
we need to use masks. It might

1661
00:50:08.147 --> 00:50:10.647
we need to use masks. It might
happen. Derek Hunter says it is so

1662
00:50:10.647 --> 00:50:12.814
happen. Derek Hunter says it is so
difficult to buy any facemasks in

1663
00:50:12.814 --> 00:50:13.856
difficult to buy any facemasks in
order to protect yourself. Many

1664
00:50:13.856 --> 00:50:15.772
order to protect yourself. Many
outlets online are charging over the

1665
00:50:15.772 --> 00:50:16.439
outlats online are charging over the
odds for

1666
00:50:16.439 --> 00:50:17.522
outlets online are charging over the
odds for masks, and that is before

1667
00:50:17.522 --> 00:50:20.606
odds for masks, and that is before
you add in postage and packing. What

1668
00:50:20.606 --> 00:50:21.397
you add in postage and packing. what
is happening

1669
00:50:21.397 --> 00:50:22.314
you add in postage and packing. What
is happening with masks? We know

1670
00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:24.856
is happening with masks? We know
that the Government is reviewing the

1671
00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:28.939
that the Government is reviewing the
guidelines. Is it partly because we

1672
00:50:28.939 --> 00:50:33.231
guidelines. Is it partly because we
haven’t got enough? Or is it that

1673
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:34.939
haven’t got enough? Or is it that
the Government hasn’t decided on

1674
00:50:34.939 --> 00:50:38.147
the Government hasn’t decided on
this? I think the point was put

1675
00:50:38.147 --> 00:50:38.481
this? I think the point was put
dearty

1676
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:39.481
this? I think the point was put
clearly about the evidence on this.

1677
00:50:39.481 --> 00:50:40.439
dearty about the evidence on this.
I think

1678
00:50:40.439 --> 00:50:41.439
clearly about the evidence on this.
I think when you haven’t got clear

1679
00:50:41.439 --> 00:50:42.897
I think when you haven’t got clear
evidence that masks are going to

1680
00:50:42.897 --> 00:50:45.231
evidence that masks are going to
make that key difference, then we

1681
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:46.814
make that key difference, then we
shouldn’t be privatising that. Why

1682
00:50:46.814 --> 00:50:47.231
shouldn’t be privatising that. why
are all

1683
00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:49.189
shouldn’t be privatising that. Why
are all these other countries doing

1684
00:50:49.189 --> 00:50:53.814
are all these other countries doing
it? That seems puzzling to the

1685
00:50:53.814 --> 00:50:53.939
it? That seems puuling to the
people

1686
00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:55.314
it? That seems puzzling to the
people contacting us. The World

1687
00:50:55.314 --> 00:50:55.439
peopla contacting us. The World
Health

1688
00:50:55.439 --> 00:50:57.022
people contacting us. The World
Health Organization advice is

1689
00:50:57.022 --> 00:50:59.106
Health Organization advice is
relevant, advice of medical and

1690
00:50:59.106 --> 00:51:00.356
relevant, advice of medical and
scientific officers is relevant.

1691
00:51:00.356 --> 00:51:04.939
scientific officers is relevant.
There are different types of masks,

1692
00:51:04.939 --> 00:51:06.022
There are different types of masks,
there are plain cloth masks,

1693
00:51:06.022 --> 00:51:06.231
there are plain doth masks,
surgical

1694
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:07.439
there are plain cloth masks,
surgical masks that are going to be

1695
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:08.814
surgical masks that are going to be
of real help to people that are

1696
00:51:08.814 --> 00:51:10.147
of real help to peopla that are
doing dose

1697
00:51:10.147 --> 00:51:11.231
of real help to people that are
doing close work, close contact work

1698
00:51:11.231 --> 00:51:12.064
doing dose work, close contact work
in hospitals or

1699
00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:12.939
doing close work, close contact work
in hospitals or other places. There

1700
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.606
in hospitals or other places. There
is a dear

1701
00:51:14.606 --> 00:51:17.022
in hospitals or other places. There
is a clear case therefore masks. But

1702
00:51:17.022 --> 00:51:17.606
is a dear rase therefore masks. But
for the general

1703
00:51:17.606 --> 00:51:18.314
is a clear case therefore masks. But
for the general public? I have

1704
00:51:18.314 --> 00:51:20.939
for the general public? I have
listened carefully and I take the

1705
00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:22.606
listened carefully and I take the
point that you wear a mask to stop

1706
00:51:22.606 --> 00:51:26.897
point that you wear a mask to stop
you transmitting any particles or

1707
00:51:26.897 --> 00:51:27.106
you transmitting any partidas or
disease

1708
00:51:27.106 --> 00:51:28.314
you transmitting any particles or
disease to other people. I think we

1709
00:51:28.314 --> 00:51:29.522
disease to other people. I think we
are looking very carefully at the

1710
00:51:29.522 --> 00:51:32.939
are looking very carefully at the
evidence on this. And we are

1711
00:51:32.939 --> 00:51:33.397
evidence on this. And we are
constantly asking ourselves

1712
00:51:33.397 --> 00:51:36.272
constantly asking ourselves
questions about the strength or

1713
00:51:36.272 --> 00:51:37.856
questions about the strength or
otherwise of it, and then taking

1714
00:51:37.856 --> 00:51:40.939
otherwise of it, and then taking
action. But at the moment, it’s

1715
00:51:40.939 --> 00:51:42.481
action. But at the moment, it’s
right to prioritise those other

1716
00:51:42.481 --> 00:51:44.439
right to prioritise those other
types of PPE that are clearly needed

1717
00:51:44.439 --> 00:51:45.272
types of PPE that are dearty needed
and are going

1718
00:51:45.272 --> 00:51:46.606
types of PPE that are clearly needed
and are going to make a difference

1719
00:51:46.606 --> 00:51:48.606
and are going to make a difference
in terms of the transmission of this

1720
00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:51.356
in terms of the transmission of this
disease. Coming to the other part of

1721
00:51:51.356 --> 00:51:53.606
disease. Coming to the other part of
the question, it’s fair to say

1722
00:51:53.606 --> 00:51:55.439
the question, it’s fair to say
Government was caught out on a PPE,

1723
00:51:55.439 --> 00:51:58.189
Government was caught out on a PPE,
in terms of not having enough, or as

1724
00:51:58.189 --> 00:51:58.814
in terms of not having enough, or as
much as peopla

1725
00:51:58.814 --> 00:51:59.397
in terms of not having enough, or as
much as people require, Richard is

1726
00:51:59.397 --> 00:51:59.606
much as peopla require, Richard is
saying

1727
00:51:59.606 --> 00:52:00.731
much as people require, Richard is
saying wouldn’t it be good to get

1728
00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:04.439
saying wouldn’t it be good to get
ahead of this on facemasks and start

1729
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:05.439
ahead of this on facemasks and start
asking [oral

1730
00:52:05.439 --> 00:52:05.939
ahead of this on facemasks and start
asking local manufacturers to stop

1731
00:52:05.939 --> 00:52:06.356
asking [oral manufacturers to stop
making them.

1732
00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:07.939
asking local manufacturers to stop
making them. Wouldn’t it be good to

1733
00:52:07.939 --> 00:52:13.022
making them. Wouldn’t it be good to
get in there early? The question of

1734
00:52:13.022 --> 00:52:14.147
get in there earty? The question of
getting in

1735
00:52:14.147 --> 00:52:14.939
get in there early? The question of
getting in there early, we have

1736
00:52:14.939 --> 00:52:15.439
getting in there earty, we have
already

1737
00:52:15.439 --> 00:52:17.731
getting in there early, we have
already ramped up the operation of

1738
00:52:17.731 --> 00:52:20.397
already ramped up the operation of
PPE. Put facemasks in particular? If

1739
00:52:20.397 --> 00:52:21.856
PPE. Put facemasks in particular? If
the evidence changes and we are told

1740
00:52:21.856 --> 00:52:23.856
the evidence changes and we are told
that facemasks are necessary, I’m

1741
00:52:23.856 --> 00:52:25.939
that facemasks are necessary, I’m
confident we can ramp it up. We do

1742
00:52:25.939 --> 00:52:26.939
confident we ran ramp it up. We do
have the ability

1743
00:52:26.939 --> 00:52:27.856
confident we can ramp it up. We do
have the ability to do that. We have

1744
00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:30.147
have the ability to do that. We have
shown in other areas that we can do

1745
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:30.689
shown in other areas that we ran do
that. Let’s

1746
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:32.481
shown in other areas that we can do
that. Let’s follow that evidence and

1747
00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:36.522
that. Let’s follow that evidence and
assess it regularly. There are two

1748
00:52:36.522 --> 00:52:36.981
assess it regularty. There are two
important

1749
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:37.939
assess it regularly. There are two
important points, I would suggest.

1750
00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:39.981
important points, I would suggest.
One is whether or not the general

1751
00:52:39.981 --> 00:52:40.106
One is whether or not the general
pub“:

1752
00:52:40.106 --> 00:52:43.189
One is whether or not the general
public should be wearing simple

1753
00:52:43.189 --> 00:52:45.439
public should be wearing simple
cloth facemasks, in order to reduce

1754
00:52:45.439 --> 00:52:46.564
cloth facemasks, in order to reduce
transmission of this virus to other

1755
00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:50.356
transmission of this virus to other
peopla. The

1756
00:52:50.356 --> 00:52:50.481
transmission of this virus to other
people. Thejury

1757
00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:51.564
transmission of this virus to other
people. The jury is out there, the

1758
00:52:51.564 --> 00:52:53.814
people. The jury is out there, the
WHO is still not advising that. At

1759
00:52:53.814 --> 00:52:55.397
WHO is still not advising that. At
many national countries and New

1760
00:52:55.397 --> 00:52:57.022
many national countries and New
York, as you said, most definitely

1761
00:52:57.022 --> 00:52:59.897
York, as you said, most definitely
are. It would be helpful to know

1762
00:52:59.897 --> 00:53:01.606
are. It would be helpful to know
when the Government is going to give

1763
00:53:01.606 --> 00:53:03.356
when the Government is going to give
the public a definitive answer on

1764
00:53:03.356 --> 00:53:05.106
the public a definitive answer on
that. I don’t think the evidence is

1765
00:53:05.106 --> 00:53:06.522
that. I don’t think the evidence is
going to change quickly. It would be

1766
00:53:06.522 --> 00:53:08.647
going to change quickly. It would be
helpful to know that sooner rather

1767
00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:10.397
helpful to know that sooner rather
than later. The second point is

1768
00:53:10.397 --> 00:53:11.897
than later. The second point is
about the PPE that we most

1769
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:14.272
about the PPE that we most
definitely know it is needed, and is

1770
00:53:14.272 --> 00:53:16.189
definitely know it is needed, and is
needed desperately on the front

1771
00:53:16.189 --> 00:53:18.772
needed desperately on the front
line. That is the PPE that is

1772
00:53:18.772 --> 00:53:21.606
line. That is the PPE that is
protecting front line staff, whether

1773
00:53:21.606 --> 00:53:22.856
protecting front line staff, whether
NHS or carers, from infection. And

1774
00:53:22.856 --> 00:53:25.772
NHS or carers, from infection. And
we know that there are huge problems

1775
00:53:25.772 --> 00:53:27.356
we know that there are huge problems
with capacity there. They are not

1776
00:53:27.356 --> 00:53:29.064
with capacity there. They are not
unique to the UK, there are problems

1777
00:53:29.064 --> 00:53:30.981
unique to the UK, there are problems
all over the world. But we also have

1778
00:53:30.981 --> 00:53:33.439
all over the world. But we also have
a country in lockdown right now. So

1779
00:53:33.439 --> 00:53:36.606
a country in lockdown right now. So
we have all of these SMEs, small and

1780
00:53:36.606 --> 00:53:37.356
we have all of these SMEs, small and
medium—sized businesses, so many

1781
00:53:37.356 --> 00:53:37.981
medium-sized businesses, so many
peopla up and

1782
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:38.856
medium—sized businesses, so many
people up and down the country that

1783
00:53:38.856 --> 00:53:39.439
peopla up and down the country that
are not working

1784
00:53:39.439 --> 00:53:43.064
people up and down the country that
are not working currently, where is

1785
00:53:43.064 --> 00:53:46.272
are not working currently, where is
the national government led effort

1786
00:53:46.272 --> 00:53:51.481
the national government led effort
to boost production? Rachel, about

1787
00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:52.439
to boost production? Rachel, about
20 seconds left? British businesses

1788
00:53:52.439 --> 00:53:54.939
20 seconds left? British businesses
there to step up to the mark.

1789
00:53:54.939 --> 00:53:56.231
there to step up to the mark.
Burberry is already making them. We

1790
00:53:56.231 --> 00:54:01.522
Burberry is already making them. We
just heard

1791
00:54:04.522 --> 00:54:07.606
just heard Barbour is making masks.
We are out of time, I’m afraid. Just

1792
00:54:07.606 --> 00:54:09.106
We are out of time, I’m afraid. just
in time is off

1793
00:54:09.106 --> 00:54:09.981
We are out of time, I’m afraid. Just
in time is off air next week. We

1794
00:54:09.981 --> 00:54:12.314
in time is off air next week. We
will be back the week after, which

1795
00:54:12.314 --> 00:54:16.189
will be back the week after, which
is, of course, April the 30th.

1796
00:54:16.189 --> 00:54:17.981
is, of course, April the 30th.
Tonight, our recorded questions came

1797
00:54:17.981 --> 00:54:19.231
Tonight, our recorded questions came
from Wolverhampton. In two weeks we

1798
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:20.897
from Wolverhampton. In two weeks we
would like to take questions from

1799
00:54:20.897 --> 00:54:23.897
would like to take questions from
Leeds. You can’t come to the studio,

1800
00:54:23.897 --> 00:54:26.939
Leeds. You can’t come to the studio,
not for some time, I suspect. And we

1801
00:54:26.939 --> 00:54:28.814
not for some time, I suspect. And we
need to hear from you. Question Time

1802
00:54:28.814 --> 00:54:33.481
need to hear from you. Question Time
without an audience, even without an

1803
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:37.647
without an audience, even without an

1804
00:54:37.647 --> 00:54:38.606
without an audience, even without an

thanks forjoining us from Wigan.
Thank you to everybody he recorded a

1823
00:55:07.189 --> 00:55:08.522
Thank you to everybody he recorded a
question or got in touch during the

1824
00:55:08.522 --> 00:55:11.356
question or got in touch during the
programme. From Question Time, for

this week, we will see you in two
weeks. Goodbye.

1827
00:55:54.981 --> 00:55:57.189
This is a message
from the Government.

1828
00:55:57.189 --> 00:55:59.814
Coronavirus is a national emergency,

1829
00:55:59.814 --> 00:56:03.731
life—threatening for people of all
ages, everywhere in the UK.

1830
00:56:03.731 --> 00:56:06.606
To help save lives, stay home.

1831
00:56:06.606 --> 00:56:09.981
Only go outside for food,
health reasons or work,

1832
00:56:09.981 --> 00:56:12.689
but only if you cannot
work from home.

1833
00:56:12.689 --> 00:56:13.897
Stay home.

1834
00:56:13.897 --> 00:56:16.981
Anyone can get it,
and anyone can spread it.

1835
00:56:16.981 --> 00:56:18.606
Stay home.

1836
00:56:18.606 --> 00:56:22.397
Protect the NHS frontline staff
working to save lives.

1837
00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:43.606
It’s finals week on MasterChef...

1838
00:56:45.397 --> 00:56:47.022
Wow, that’s hot.

1839
00:56:47.022 --> 00:56:48.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, no.

1840
00:56:48.814 --> 00:56:52.064
..and the battle for
the title is almost over.

1841
00:56:54.564 --> 00:56:58.397
I never, ever in my wildest dreams
thought I’d get this far.

1842
00:56:58.397 --> 00:57:00.981
I’m trying not to think about
going home at this point.

1843
00:57:00.981 --> 00:57:04.397
It would be absolutely devastating.

1844
00:57:05.814 --> 00:57:08.231
I get excited when I produce
a great plate of food.

1845
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:10.481
It’s like creating
a masterpiece painting.

1846
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:12.814
Itjust means so much to me.

1847
00:57:12.814 --> 00:57:17.147
To win would just be the cherry
on top of the cake.

1848
00:57:17.147 --> 00:57:20.856
You can see that
it’s just in your reach.

1849
00:57:20.856 --> 00:57:25.647
It would be such a huge
acknowledgement of my true passion,

1850
00:57:25.647 --> 00:57:29.231
and Ijust enjoy every
single second of it.

1851
00:57:30.522 --> 00:57:32.147
There’s been times
in this competition

1852
00:57:32.147 --> 00:57:33.856
where I’ve wobbled
with my confidence

1853
00:57:33.856 --> 00:57:35.981
and thinking,
"Should I really be here?"

1854
00:57:37.439 --> 00:57:40.147
So today I want to smash it
and get into that final three.

1855
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:48.314
Tonight, the four finalists
enter the Willy Wonka world

1856
00:57:48.314 --> 00:57:50.981
of the world’s greatest
pastry chef...

1857
00:57:52.397 --> 00:57:53.772
..Albert Adria...

1858
00:57:57.481 --> 00:57:59.147
Stretch their imaginations.

1859
00:58:00.522 --> 00:58:02.897
Let that creativity run wild.

1860
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:07.189
..before cooking off

1861
00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:10.022
to secure a coveted place

1862
00:58:10.022 --> 00:58:14.272
in the MasterChef 2020 final.

1863
00:58:14.272 --> 00:58:17.022
This is about high—end cooking.

1864
00:58:17.022 --> 00:58:19.314
This is about risk.

1865
00:58:19.314 --> 00:58:21.481
It has to be superb.

1866
00:58:32.772 --> 00:58:34.647
Barcelona, Spain.

1867
00:58:36.606 --> 00:58:39.356
Home to the culinary empire of a man

1868
00:58:39.356 --> 00:58:43.397
widely regarded as the world’s
most creative chef...

1869
00:58:44.897 --> 00:58:46.481
..Albert Adria.

1870
00:58:48.731 --> 00:58:51.606
When you talk to chefs
around the world

1871
00:58:51.606 --> 00:58:55.356
and you ask them, "Who is
the best cook on the planet?"

1872
00:58:55.356 --> 00:58:58.106
Technically speaking,
execution—wise,

1873
00:58:58.106 --> 00:59:00.356
most of them are going
to tell you Albert Adria.

1874
00:59:02.481 --> 00:59:05.022
Cos, pound for pound, he really is.
He can do it all.

1875
00:59:07.314 --> 00:59:09.272
35 years ago,

1876
00:59:09.272 --> 00:59:14.397
a teenage Albert went to work
alongside his older brother, Ferran,

1877
00:59:14.397 --> 00:59:16.606
where they led a revolution

1878
00:59:16.606 --> 00:59:20.231
that changed the world
of food forever.

1879
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:23.647
Sauces became foams and airs,

1880
00:59:23.647 --> 00:59:27.314
ingredients and flavours
were turned into spheres,

1881
00:59:27.314 --> 00:59:31.606
and centuries—old cooking
techniques questioned.

1882
00:59:31.606 --> 00:59:35.439
Ferran and Albert sort of blew
the doors off of cuisine.

1883
00:59:37.064 --> 00:59:40.981
As El Bulli’s creative director
and head of pastry,

1884
00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:44.064
Albert took charge of
the restaurant’s desserts

1885
00:59:44.064 --> 00:59:49.106
and soon gained himself a reputation
as the world’s greatest pastry chef.

1886
00:59:50.481 --> 00:59:53.231
IN SPANISH:

1887
00:59:57.231 --> 01:00:00.522
After El Bulli closed in 2011...

1888
01:00:03.606 --> 01:00:07.106
..Albert opened a series of
restaurants in Barcelona...

1889
01:00:10.397 --> 01:00:12.856
..all of which are designed
to take the diner
