Good evening, welcome
to my panel here in the studio,

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.875
welcome toJess and Iona,
who are joining us down the line

20
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.958
and, of course, to our audience,
thank you very much,

21
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.291
our virtual audience,
you are all under 30 this evening.

22
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.375
Lucky you.

23
00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.750
And thank you very much
forjoining us and thank

24
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.000

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.666
If you want to join
the conversation, you can,

26
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.583
in the usual way on social
media, @bbcquestiontime.

27
00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:36.875
So, our first question tonight
is from Suresh Bindra.

28
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.583
I welcome the easing of lockdown,

29
00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:41.791
so people can move
on with their lives.

30
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.083
Life is all about risks and,
having been under the complete

31
00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:48.208
control of the state since March
23rd, is it not time to allow

32
00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.625
people, who are aware of the risks
now, to make decisions about how

33
00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.750
they want to approach this
situation,

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.958
given we live
in a free, liberal society?

35
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:04.416
Theo.

36
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:07.041
Wow, control of the state,
that’s one way of putting it.

37
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.000
I think they were trying
to keep us safe.

38
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.416
I don’t think anyone wants
to be kept locked up,

39
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:15.875
but the reality was,
if we hadn’t had the lockdown,

40
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.958
many of us wouldn’t be here today,
especially oldies like me.

41
00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.791
So I think we’ve had to endure that
and we have to come out of this

42
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:26.291
sooner rather than later,
I totally agree, because otherwise

43
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:30.875
we’re going to have a lot
of unintended consequences,

44
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.000
and that’s things that will be a lot
worse than possibly, you know,

45
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.125
some minor outbreaks
of the actual virus.

46
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.333
So it’s important that we come
out now, it’s important

47
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.208
that we adopt the new normal,
because it is a new normal.

48
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:49.125
We will never be back to normal
until we get one of two things.

49
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:54.333
A vaccine or a successful treatment.

50
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.958
When we’ve got those two things,
we can get back to normal.

51
00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.541
Until then, we will be under
control, one way or another

52
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:02.666
and we’d better stick to it,
otherwise we’ll be

53
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:03.708
on total lockdown.

54
00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:05.083
You say stick to it.

55
00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:08.833
Jess Phillips, the rules are pretty
complex now and, of course,

56
00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.708
they are different in different
parts of the UK and what Suresh

57
00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.041
is saying, is it not time to allow
people to make decisions about how

58
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.458
they want to approach
this situation?

59
00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:20.958
Look, I mean that that’s ultimately
what we want for everybody.

60
00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:26.125
We want everybody to feel free
and be able to go around and do how

61
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.708
they would have done prior
to lockdown, but, I mean,

62
00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.916
where I live, lots and lots
of people have died

63
00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.041
and, all over the country,
that is the case.

64
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:40.250
In areas like the one I represent,
which has large proportions

65
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:45.708
of poorer communities and BAME
communities, we’ve seen terrible

66
00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:49.250
rates of deaths and, so,
as Theo said, these controls

67
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.208
were to try and keep us safe,
but it is very confusing for people,

68
00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:56.166
and so I think that,
fundamentally, now, people

69
00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:01.083
are going to startjust doing
what they think is right,

70
00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:05.083
because it seems there is a changing
landscape with the communication

71
00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:08.583
that we are hearing.

72
00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:11.000
I’ve had people this week,
pregnant women, saying to me,

73
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.375
'I am in my third trimester,
ran I go out?"

74
00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:15.791
Older people who were
shielding saying,

75
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.375
"Well, what are the rules for me?"

76
00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:23.541
And I think it needs much
clearer communication and,

77
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:27.000
also, an understanding that this
isn’t to control.

78
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.083
This wasn’t to try...

79
00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:30.750
The Government, I could criticise
them on a lot of things,

80
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.625
I don’t think they are out
there to try and control our

81
00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:34.666
minds or our liberty.

82
00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:37.791
The reality is that we need to be
able to trust the Government

83
00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:41.000
in what they say and listen
when they speak and believe

84
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.083
that it is based on our welfare and,
at the moment, Ifeel

85
00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:47.291
that the communication
is a bit confusing.

86
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:52.208
Steve, making decisions,
allowing people to make decisions

87
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.333
about how they want to approach
a situation, is that what we’ve seen

88
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.500
in Bournemouth today,
where a major incident was declared

89
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.375
because so many people
descended on to Bournemouth

90
00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:00.625
and onto the beach?

91
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:03.708
Well, obviously, what we’re seeing
in Bournemouth is very

92
00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:05.583
disappointing today but,
as Theo says, the lockdown

93
00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:07.791
only works with the
consent of the people.

94
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:13.000
We have to trust the vast majority
of people complied with the lockdown

95
00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.875
because they saw the advice
from the Chief Medical Officer,

96
00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:17.541
the advice from the Chief
Scientific Officer.

97
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.958
They saw what was happening in other
countries, where health

98
00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.916
systems were overwhelmed,
and recognised we needed to protect

99
00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:26.208
the NHS and take the lockdown,
as Theo says, to save lives.

100
00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:31.375
That is the measures that were taken
but it is a balance,

101
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:37.875
as the questioner says,
as to the concerns over

102
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.333
is the lockdown too much or others,
like jess,

103
00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:45.416
feel was it insufficient?

104
00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:48.041
So there is an argument
here but we have to trust

105
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.166
the common—sense of the British
public, we can’t legislate

106
00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.250
for every single scenario.

107
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.875
And the vast majority, yes,
there’s been an issue in Bournemouth

108
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.083
today but the vast majority...

109
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:58.208
And there was also a rave in Brixton
last night, in south London.

110
00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:01.083
There will always be exceptions
but the vast majority of the British

111
00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:03.750
public have exercised common sense,
have worked to protect the NHS,

112
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.625
have made huge sacrifices
but it is right now that we restart

113
00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:09.000
the economy, because there
is consequences to that as well.

114
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.125
Do you think it was inevitable,
in some way, that we would see

115
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:14.041
a scene like we did
at Bournemouth today?

116
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:17.416
When you have the Prime Minister
just two days ago, when he was asked

117
00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:19.833
by 3 Brighton MP about how seaside
towns should respond

118
00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:22.458
to a potential influx of people,
such as we have seen,

119
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.333
he said, "I’ll be calling on local
representatives to show some guts

120
00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:28.000
"and champion their communities
as venues to return to and support."

121
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.625
Do you think that is helpful,
given what we’ve seen today?

122
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.000
All we said was people need
to exercise common sense,

123
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.125
observe two metres where they can,
but there are circumstances,

124
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:39.000
and I’m sure we will come unto them,
from a business perspective,

125
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.166
where there are pressures
which are impacting people’s lives,

126
00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.875
on theirjobs, people
losing theirjobs,

127
00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:47.875
their livelihoods, that also has
health consequences as well,

128
00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.291
both from a macrolevel in terms
of the ability of the state to pay

129
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.916
for things like our NHS,
but also in terms of pressures

130
00:06:53.916 --> 00:06:54.958
such on mental health.

131
00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.916
So there is a balance to be struck.

132
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.291
I think on the whole,
the British public have responded

133
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:01.416
extremely well in observing
the lockdown, but it’s right

134
00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:02.875
now that we restart the economy.

135
00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:03.916
Kirsty?

136
00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.000
Hi.

137
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So, as someone actually
from the shielding category,

138
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.041
I’ve got kidney failure,
so I’ve been pretty much

139
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:10.500
in isolation for three months.

140
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.000
The idea of releasing,
just completely sort

141
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.625
of releasing lockdown,
just terrifies me, to be honest.

142
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:20.000
In Brighton today, already,
the beaches were incredibly crowded

143
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.083
and Ifeel like if we reduce
lockdown any more, things like that

144
00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.541
are going to happen more.

145
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:28.958
We had tonnes of people coming down
to Brighton and I can’t do anything.

146
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.666
I don’t look ill, so when I am out
and about and I’m just starting

147
00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:34.958
to go out into society,
people don’t know I’m

148
00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.250
ill, and so people...

149
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.083
Yeah, my health is reliant
on other people’s actions

150
00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:43.708
and that’s quite scary,
because I feel very out of control

151
00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:46.541
of my own situation.

152
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:50.250
Kofi, you had your hand up.

153
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.458
Yes, in a similar vein to that,
I also live with a vulnerable person

154
00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:59.541
who happens, like myself,
to be BAME and we’ve seen a lot

155
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:04.708
covered on the news about how
the BAME community and people

156
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.125
of colour are very
vulnerable to the virus.

157
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:11.000
And when we look at the countries
who have lifted the lockdown,

158
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.666
we have seen there have been some
spikes in the virus.

159
00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:16.083
Now, obviously, the Government, they
are dealing with two priorities.

160
00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:19.166
One is to protect lives and
the other is to protect the economy.

161
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:24.375
So I’m just wondering,
if we are doing both,

162
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:28.500
what sort of plan is the Government
going to come up with to make sure

163
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.916
that two and two don’t sort
of come together here?

164
00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:33.541
And that we are also ensuring
that those who are particularly

165
00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:35.916
vulnerable and those in the BAME
community will be protected

166
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:36.958
while lifting these restrictions?

167
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.166
And, Suresh, you asked the question.

168
00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:42.250
Yes, thank you for
letting me respond.

169
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.541
I completely agree
with what Theo said.

170
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:48.416
I do think that the lockdown being
implemented when it was implemented

171
00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:51.791
was the correct time,
but I think now, the indirect

172
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:54.500
effect of the lockdown,
no one can quantify those.

173
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.208
You can’t quantify the massive
impact on children’s mental health.

174
00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:01.916
They’ve been away from
education for six months.

175
00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.791
People are missing
cancer appointments.

176
00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:08.000
Cancer is a potent disease.

177
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.541
So I think the lockdown should be
eased as quickly as possible

178
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:16.000
in a safe way and people
are now aware of the risks,

179
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.875
so they can choose to accept those
and I think the economy

180
00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.083
does need to get moving

181
00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:22.958
as well as other issues too,
so I do welcome the lockdown

182
00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.666
being eased slowly.

183
00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:30.708
50, George, Suresh’s question
was is it time to allow people start

184
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:33.500
50, George, Suresh’s question
was is it time to allow people

185
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.625
to make their own decisions
about how they approach

186
00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:36.666
this pandemic?

187
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:37.916
Thanks for the question, Suresh.

188
00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:39.833
Well, I think people
making their own decisions

189
00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.750
is contingent on them having
reliable information and,

190
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.666
unfortunately, I don’t get that
from this government.

191
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:47.625
I don’t feel like we are having
consistent, clear messaging.

192
00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:52.041
When the lockdown was initially
imposed, it was very unclear,

193
00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:56.333
the details of that lockdown.

194
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:59.666
As these measures have been eased,
we’ve been told to factor

195
00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:04.916
in the R number or the...

196
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:11.583
We make arbitrary decisions
about what is appropriate behaviour,

197
00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:16.000
where most of us can’t really figure
out what even the threshold

198
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.333
for achieving what the Government
was describing as herd immunity

199
00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.958
was once describing as herd immunity

200
00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.000
would be.

201
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.166
So I take Steve’s point
about the British public

202
00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.208
not being stupid, but we really need
clear and consistent messaging.

203
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:31.791
Iona?

204
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:35.875
Well, I think that Suresh has
quite rightly brought up

205
00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:38.541
the concerns about the economy,
but also about people’s

206
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.833
mental and physical health
during this time and,

207
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:45.083
obviously, lockdown across the whole
country is not sustainable

208
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:48.458
and therefore we have to find a way,
as Theo has said, of living

209
00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:53.666
with the virus and having some
distance from the virus and making

210
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.291
sure we can do that safely,
until we find a vaccine

211
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:58.000
or an effective treatment.

212
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.583
And I also completely understand
Kirsty and Kofi’s concerns

213
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:05.500
about coming back into society
if they don’t feel that it is

214
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.125
absolutely 100% safe yet
to be back out there,

215
00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:12.750
and these are the two competing
concerns that we are having

216
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.875
to consider right now,
and there are no easy

217
00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:16.791
choices to make.

218
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:19.166
But when we look at what happened
in Bournemouth today,

219
00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:21.833
I think we need to appeal
to people’s sense of responsibility

220
00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:24.291
and I think most people have
complied remarkably well

221
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.458
with the lockdown,
especially young people.

222
00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:32.125
I think this next generation coming
through have really divide this

223
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.000
through have really defied this

224
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.333
snowflake stereotype that’s been
applied to them too many times

225
00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:40.500
and have actually shown themselves
to be very compassionate,

226
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.125
very responsible and very stoic
and I’m sure we can appeal

227
00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:46.000
to their sense of responsibility
and say, look, try and have some

228
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.208
good judgment of bad situations.

229
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.291
good judgment about situations.

230
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.958
Like going to the beach,
if you think it’s too crowded,

231
00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.333
try and stay away because it
would be so devastating

232
00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:56.958
for us to have to go back
into a second lockdown,

233
00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.416
both financially and for our health.

234
00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:01.250
Lots of you have got your hands up
in our virtual audience.

235
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.291
Hannah.

236
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.333
Thank you.

237
00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:08.000
I think what Suresh said
about people accepting the risk

238
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.458
is not the full story.

239
00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:12.958
You accept the risk for yourself,
by breaking lockdown,

240
00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.833
by wishing lockdown was over sooner,
but you don’t accept the risk

241
00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:18.166
for people like key workers,
who don’t have a choice,

242
00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:19.708
they have to leave the house.

243
00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:23.000
For example, my dad was 55,
he was a key worker and he passed

244
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.333
away from coronavirus.

245
00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.416
Hannah, I’m so sorry to hear that.

246
00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:29.708
Thank you.

247
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.416
When you say people can
make their own choice

248
00:12:32.416 --> 00:12:34.708
and accept the risk,
you also accept the risk

249
00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:37.666
for the people that you will infect.

250
00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:41.416
And of course, that is the different
thing about this pandemic,

251
00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:44.541
is that it is not necessarilyjust
the risk you take on yourself,

252
00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:46.750
it is how you affect
other people as well.

253
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.000
Emma?

254
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.791
Yes, reallyjust to echo
what Hannah just said.

255
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:55.750
My family are all pretty much NHS
workers so although you might be

256
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.833
taking a risk yourself,
if you got ill, you end up

257
00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:02.000
in hospital, it is putting people
like that at risk as well.

258
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.875
George also mentioned about having
clear messaging and people

259
00:13:05.875 --> 00:13:08.333
using that to make decisions.

260
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:11.125
Well, the daily briefings are gone.

261
00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:13.541
I’m in Scotland, we are quite
lucky where we are,

262
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:18.208
we still have some visibility
of what is going on but in England,

263
00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:20.833
as far as I’m aware,
it’s almost like it is back

264
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.416
to business as usual.

265
00:13:23.416 --> 00:13:25.208
Daniel.

266
00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:30.416
Ijust wanted to make
a comment about the lockdown.

267
00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:40.208
So, I live with both my parents,
who are in an at—risk

268
00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.875
vulnerable category,
so I’ve been in lockdown

269
00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:42.958
for overfour months

270
00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.875
now because, instead
of following what the Government

271
00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.250
advice was, I decided
it was probably safer for us

272
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.958
to lockdown earlier,
because if you look

273
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.375
at when we lockdown,
compared with nearly every other

274
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:53.250
country in Europe, including
Germany, we came out later,

275
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.875
so I just want to ask the Government
if they think they advice has either

276
00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:00.166
if they think their advice has

277
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.791
either been clear or sensible?

278
00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:03.000
either been clear or sensible?

279
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.125
Because the number of people I know
that have died from the virus,

280
00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:10.208
it is over ten now, so I don’t feel
like I’ve been able to put my full

281
00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:12.333
faith in the Government
in looking after my parents.

282
00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:13.416
Gosh, ten people, Daniel.

283
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:18.583
You know ten people who have
died from the virus.

284
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.625
I’ve got one friend,
his uncle and his father died

285
00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:23.666
within a one—month period.

286
00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:25.125
I’m so, so sorry to that.

287
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:27.041
I mean, Steve, it is
interesting, isn’t it?

288
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:30.666
We have a panel here of people under
30 and you are not all necessarily

289
00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:32.583
saying the same thing,
but it’s interesting how

290
00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:35.666
many of you are saying, caution,
you know, let’s not rush into this,

291
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.750
people are vulnerable.

292
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.541
You yourselves perhaps
are vulnerable because you have

293
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:43.166
underlying illnesses or you live
with people who have them,

294
00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:45.833
and you had George and a number
of people there talking

295
00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:48.291
about they don’t feel
they are getting clear messaging.

296
00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:51.166
Well, you hearfrom the personal
loss and the tragedy of that why

297
00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:55.000
the lockdown was necessary,
to get the infection down, which it

298
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
has done, to protect the NHS,
to ensure we met the five test

299
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.125
that we set...

300
00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:03.541
But what about what they are saying
about the messaging not being clear?

301
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:05.958
Just to answer George,
his question when he was saying

302
00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.625
the lockdown wasn’t clear
enough, the opposite.

303
00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:09.791
If you look at the stay
at for example.

304
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:12.166
The Sage advice was up to 20%
of children continuing

305
00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:15.000
going to school, it actually dropped
to fewer than 2%, so actually,

306
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.583
the lockdown was highly effective.

307
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:21.208
The question is, how do
you then balance, and again,

308
00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:24.333
one of the comments was we are now
lifting it in its entirety.

309
00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.958
We are not, it is in a staged way,
so there are still many areas,

310
00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.083
like theatres, like gyms,
who may come onto it.

311
00:15:30.083 --> 00:15:33.000
Areas where people say we are not
lifting the lockdown quickly enough

312
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.458
because they want to get to work,
they are worried about their

313
00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:39.041
livelihood, so it’s a balance,
and the messaging was very clear...

314
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:40.791
And do you think it’s clear now?

315
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.125
..that has enabled us to get
the infection rate down

316
00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:44.666
in the way that we have.

317
00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:48.250
So, just on that point, let me just
clarify what I was trying to say.

318
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.000
It is not that the idea
of lockdown wasn’t clear

319
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.166
when it was established,
it is that, first of all,

320
00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.125
the leader of your government missed
five COBRA meetings...

321
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:04.833
That is not how COBRA works.

322
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:07.500
0K, fine, advice from top scientists
was ignored for a while,

323
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.708
as the point was made
from the panel, we were the last

324
00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:15.958
of the rich countries,
definitely, to enact a lockdown

325
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:21.125
in our geographic neighbourhood
and there has been reports from very

326
00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:24.625
credible people in the medical
community that say if action

327
00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:28.000
was taken even two weeks later,
there would be a significant dent

328
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.208
in the number of dead
from Covid—related deaths,

329
00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:38.958
even as late as April,
I think the Government was denying

330
00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.333
that there was a significant risk
to care facilities and,

331
00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:46.708
by mid—May, 40% of Covid—related
deaths had come from care homes.

332
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:51.916
So I think it would go a long way
if your government began to show

333
00:16:53.666 --> 00:16:56.041
a little bit of contrition
and acknowledgement of the mistakes

334
00:16:56.041 --> 00:16:59.416
that have been made in the handling
of this crisis up to this point,

335
00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:02.666
as opposed to the nit picking
at the point arguing

336
00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:04.833
we have seen on Twitter,
very strangely, from this

337
00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:10.041
government in particular.

338
00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:12.541
Jess.

339
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:15.166
I agree with lots of that
and part of the problem

340
00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:17.125
with the communication that
I certainly have found

341
00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:19.500
as a constituency MP,
let alone a citizen with children

342
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.291
out of school, is that
the Government would stand in front

343
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:25.666
of us and say things like,
"We’ve put a protective

344
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:26.833
ring around care homes."

345
00:17:26.833 --> 00:17:29.250
And I felt at times
like I was going mad,

346
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.250
because I was talking to my care
homes and hearing the reality

347
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.916
on the ground and, you know,
I think the idea that we need

348
00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:39.291
complete honesty
and complete trust...

349
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:44.458
And it is hard to trust
politicians at the best

350
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.708
of times, I get that,
but, at the moment, we need real

351
00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:53.916
trust and honesty in our politics,
because that is the only way that

352
00:17:54.416 --> 00:17:57.916
any consent of either
the lifting of lockdown or that

353
00:17:57.916 --> 00:18:02.166
if we have to go back into it,
or as we had seen when we had to go

354
00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:03.875
into it, it is going to work...

355
00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:04.958
So a bit confused.

356
00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.125
It has felt sometimes
like there was one

357
00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:10.208
rule for one and one rule for
another, in that very, very famous

358
00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:11.500
ffH-Ill-YIF

359
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.666
We are just asking for honesty,
I think, as citizens and

360
00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:20.208
certainly as the opposition,.

361
00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:22.625
I want the Government
to do well but I do

362
00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:25.750
have to feel that I can trust
that they are telling the truth.

363
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.916
OK, let’s take another question
now, from Iman Anwar.

364
00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:31.708
Hi.

365
00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:36.916
With youth unemployment on the rise,
and worries over further negative

366
00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:42.333
impacts on our economy and recovery
— and as a recent graduate

367
00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:44.750
as of December 2019 —
what assurances do I have,

368
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.083
as a young person entering
the professional world of work,

369
00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:51.291
that there is enough opportunity
available for me?

370
00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:55.000
And what is your situation, Iman?

371
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.208
Sol had a job offer
in the advertising industry,

372
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:05.291
which is what I graduated in,
but it was revoked

373
00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:07.958
because of lockdown and,
you know, they said that

374
00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:12.541
because of their financials
for the rest of the year

375
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.500
and the worry around coronavirus,
they weren’t really sure if they

376
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.375
could keep my new employment,
so I’m just a little bit concerned

377
00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:24.583
about if there is enough...

378
00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.750
You know, young people already don’t
have enough opportunity

379
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:31.916
as it is in the professional space,
so I’m just worried about what plan

380
00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:37.833
the Government has to sort of bring
that opportunity up for us.

381
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.166
So you had a job,
which has now gone.

382
00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:42.916
Are you working
at all at the moment?

383
00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:45.791
Yes, I am currently working on food
supply, it was my part—time

384
00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:49.000
job at university and,
luckily, I didn’t hand in my notice,

385
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.416
so I can still, luckily,
I can still work there.

386
00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:53.750
So a supermarket, or
something like that?

387
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.041
Yes.

388
00:19:55.041 --> 00:20:00.250
Right, and just out of interest,
hands up in our audience,

389
00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:10.041
how many of you are out of work
or have been furloughed?

390
00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:11.083
Right, 0K.

391
00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:13.250
What is going to happen
to young people, Steve?

392
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.916
Boris Johnson talked
about they should all

393
00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:16.000
have apprenticeships.

394
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.083
A lot of people seem to have been
taken by surprise by that.

395
00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:20.416
Is that going to happen?

396
00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:23.291
Well, the key challenge before us
is jobs and if you look

397
00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:27.666
at what happened going
into the pandemic, we had halved

398
00:20:27.666 --> 00:20:30.291
the rate of unemployment
in the young, but the young tend

399
00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:33.666
to be the first to feel the impacts
of a recession, which is why,

400
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:36.791
if you look at the figures now
for the 18—245, they are 10%

401
00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:42.000
of the working age population
but 18% of welfare claimants,

402
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:46.625
so they tend to feel it
hardest first and are often

403
00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:48.500
in the sectors of hospitality,
tourism, where the

404
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.583
impacts are greater.

405
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:54.208
So the strategy has been, first,
to protect as manyjobs as possible.

406
00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:55.916
That’s why we’ve had
the furlough scheme,

407
00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:58.250
which has protected over 9 million
jobs, at a significant

408
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.458
cost, over £22 billion.

409
00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:03.041
The self—employment scheme,
which has protected, again,

410
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:08.250
around 2.5 million jobs at a cost
of 7.5 billion.

411
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:12.125
We supported 850,000 businesses
through the grant scheme, investing,

412
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:15.375
again, £10 billion into that.

413
00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.833
So there’s been very
significant measures,

414
00:21:16.833 --> 00:21:17.875
alongside all the things

415
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.250
we’ve done on cash flow to support
businesses as well.

416
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.458
And what about these
apprenticeships?

417
00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:24.625
Now, moving forward, you are right,
you then go from that protect phase

418
00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:26.708
onto the next phase,
which is how do we

419
00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:27.791
restart the economy?

420
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:30.916
What are the jobs that we can then
move to from those areas

421
00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:34.583
of the economy where jobs
are being lost?

422
00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:37.208
So greening the economy,
looking at the challenge as a first

423
00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:41.916
major economy to set a test of net
zero by 2050...

424
00:21:41.916 --> 00:21:44.000
But, very specifically, what about,
BorisJohnson has pledged

425
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
apprenticeships for young people.

426
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.083
When might that happen?

427
00:21:46.083 --> 00:21:49.000
We are absolutely committed to that.

428
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.958
So the Chancellor will give
a statement inJuly,

429
00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:56.625
which will be all about the next
phase, talking about how

430
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:59.083
we green the economy,
how we respond with infrastructure

431
00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:01.958
projects, because jobs and jobs
particularly for young people is one

432
00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:04.583
of the key challenges before us
and that is very much

433
00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:06.458
what we are focused
on within the Treasury

434
00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.500
at the moment.

435
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.625
Iona.

436
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:11.958
Well, if I could justjump in here,
because I think Steven is absolutely

437
00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:15.041
correct to say that young people’s
jobs right now need to be right

438
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:18.166
at the top of the priority list,
because we know that young people

439
00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:22.500
are the most likely to have been
furloughed, who have had their wages

440
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.291
and hours cut as a result of this
crisis and to have lost theirjobs

441
00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:32.500
altogether, and they are also
the most likely to be working

442
00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.583
in the industries that
have been hardest hit

443
00:22:35.583 --> 00:22:37.208
by lockdown, like retail,
tourism and hospitality.

444
00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:39.625
And there are predictions
that there could be youth

445
00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:42.250
unemployment rising by 600,000 this
year because people who are leaving

446
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.416
education this year are coming
into a really tough jobs market,

447
00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:52.000
the toughest we have
ever seen and so we need

448
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.083
really specific measures.

449
00:22:53.083 --> 00:22:55.708
And I have to say, listening
to Steven there, I’m surprised

450
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.166
he didn’t mention more
about apprenticeships

451
00:22:57.166 --> 00:23:00.000
and the apprenticeship levy
and the fact that it has not been

452
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
a success since it was
introduced in 2017.

453
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.125
It was meant to get more young
people, particularly

454
00:23:04.125 --> 00:23:06.000
from disadvantaged backgrounds,
into apprenticeships to give them

455
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.291
better life chances.

456
00:23:09.291 --> 00:23:11.916
What we see is participation rates
among those from more disadvantaged

457
00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:17.125
backgrounds has fallen by a third.

458
00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:20.000
The apprenticeships have gone more
to those from privileged backgrounds

459
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.875
and we see within the rules that,
actually, the apprenticeship levy

460
00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:26.250
can be used to send managers
on courses to get MBAs.

461
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.125
I don’t think that is
what the apprenticeship

462
00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:29.250
levy was meant for.

463
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.583
It is meant to help young
people find their feet

464
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:32.875
in the world of work.

465
00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:37.333
So it’s not necessarily
about spending more money,

466
00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.750
although there could be a case
for more targeted funding,

467
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.250
it’s about spending the money well
and making sure it’s actually

468
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.291
going to young people
in the labour market.

469
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:46.000
Katie, you have got your hand up.

470
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.583
Hi, I work in hospitality,
so I’m currently furloughed and have

471
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:54.791
been since the middle of March.

472
00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:05.625
I’m lucky, as in I’m 26,
so I’ve done hospitality for quite

473
00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:07.750
some number of years,
so I’ve already got experience

474
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.375
behind me, so somebody is more
likely to keep me on,

475
00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:13.250
rather than somebody who is 17,
18 and it’s their part—time job

476
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.250
while they are studying.

477
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.333
Ikind of...

478
00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:18.791
I don’t necessarily disagree
with Iman, I can see the point

479
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:21.666
that he’s making but I also think
that, for a while, university

480
00:24:21.666 --> 00:24:24.750
degrees have been advertised
as the way to go and,

481
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.750
like, I studied music at university.

482
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.625
I know people that have studied
maths and things like that.

483
00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:33.791
I think younger people don’t
necessarily have the opportunity

484
00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:38.958
to go into something like a trade,
which is probably more valuable.

485
00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:45.875
I do think there’s a community
of people who want to be influences

486
00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:48.541
and YouTubers and things like that.

487
00:24:48.541 --> 00:24:53.708
I’m not saying that everyone,
obviously everyone is different,

488
00:24:55.833 --> 00:24:58.916
but I do feel like that is where
people would probably find more

489
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:01.500
work, if they were interested
in more like a trade rather

490
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.583
than being an influencer.

491
00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:03.583
Niamh.

492
00:25:03.583 --> 00:25:04.625
Hi, yeah.

493
00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:06.583
Ithink...

494
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:09.000
I dread to think what
it’s going to be like.

495
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.375
I graduated last September and I’ve
been in between waiting

496
00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:14.791
to start my masters and saving money
for that and it was already next

497
00:25:14.791 --> 00:25:17.125
to impossible for me
to find a job this year,

498
00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:19.791
so with the pandemic
and with Brexit, I dread to think

499
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:22.416
what it’s going to be like for those
graduating this year.

500
00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:26.000
For me, thejobs that I did
find were minimum wage,

501
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.333
they didn’t cover your living
expenses, you had to top

502
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.791
that up with benefits.

503
00:25:30.791 --> 00:25:33.541
There are unpaid internships,
completely unpaid, nothing is paid.

504
00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:38.708
They are given disproportionately
to privileged people.

505
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:43.833
I know Steven Barclay reeled off
all of these stats about young

506
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:47.750
people and where they were,
about hospitality, so that really

507
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.625
worries me, you know these things,
but there wasn’t a pandemic before,

508
00:25:51.625 --> 00:25:56.166
so young people were
suddenly on your radar?

509
00:25:56.166 --> 00:25:59.291
Kirsty.

510
00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:02.666
So I wasjust wondering, this
is kind of may be aimed at Steve,

511
00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:04.541
because I feel like,
particularly, it’s been

512
00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:06.250
raised by the pandemic,
there’s more opportunities

513
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.666
for people to work online
and with everything

514
00:26:09.666 --> 00:26:12.041
going on at the moment,
I feel like self—employment should

515
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:14.458
actually be encouraged and I don’t
feel like the Conservative

516
00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:17.416
government are actually
really encouraging people

517
00:26:17.416 --> 00:26:21.500
and particularly younger people,
there are plenty of opportunities.

518
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:26.666
I get off my back and do a lot
of things and I feel like we should

519
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.875
be encouraging self—employment
and small businesses a lot more.

520
00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:33.333
Steve, I’ll come back to you.

521
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:35.500
Theo, if we are going to talk
about self—employment,

522
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.125
obviously you were an entrepreneur
from the get go, but hearing

523
00:26:38.125 --> 00:26:42.208
from Niamh there, there’s a whole
swathe of people who are thinking

524
00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:44.125
what are myjob
prospects going to be?

525
00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:46.291
If we are facing possibly
the worst recession since

526
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:49.916
the Second World War,
if not further back than that,

527
00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:51.000
it looks pretty bleak.

528
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.666
Fiona, I couldn’t put
it better myself.

529
00:26:52.666 --> 00:26:55.416
It’s going to be tough.

530
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.791
Unemployment’s going to rise,
thejob market’s going to be

531
00:26:57.791 --> 00:26:59.625
incredibly difficult.

532
00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:04.833
Youngsters are going to face
a tsunami ofjob losses and this

533
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:08.041
is one of the few times I’m
going to say this, because I’ve

534
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:10.208
always believed in a very free
economy and non—discrimination,

535
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:14.875
but we need to start looking at some
very positive discrimination,

536
00:27:14.875 --> 00:27:20.041
where we can actually address
the issues of people of a certain

537
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.833
age, with support to employers
to make sure we encourage that.

538
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:30.125
I think we really need
to understand that...

539
00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.458
You mean encourage young people
in and older people out?

540
00:27:32.458 --> 00:27:34.875
No, not at all.

541
00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:38.166
That would be bad news.

542
00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:39.833
My firstjob...

543
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:45.000
So I left school at 16,
very little qualifications,

544
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:49.791
dyslexic, sent out 100 applications,
I got 100 rejections.

545
00:27:49.791 --> 00:27:53.541
Mind you, my applications
wouldn’t have been good

546
00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:56.333
reading with my spelling.

547
00:27:56.333 --> 00:27:59.208
But, actually, the only reason
I got a job, my firstjob

548
00:27:59.208 --> 00:28:01.375
was because at that time,
the Government were giving

549
00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:04.458
allowances to businesses,
I think it was about 1,500 quid

550
00:28:04.458 --> 00:28:09.666
a year, it wasn’t a lot of money,
but to take on somebody of a certain

551
00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:13.125
age who hadn’t had a job before.

552
00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:16.500
So they took me on when they were
really not sure that they should

553
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.125
actually be spending £1500
but the fact was it was subsidised,

554
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:21.750
and that gave me my firstjob
in my first opportunity.

555
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.666
And then I could move on from there.

556
00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:28.041
So we need initiatives like that.

557
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:29.708
Because the measures
that the Chancellor has

558
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.083
put in were required,
but it was a blunt instrument,

559
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:35.125
blunderbuss approach that had to be
done very quickly and I’m afraid

560
00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:40.375
some people went through the net.

561
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.375
Now we need to focus a lot more
and deal with category by category,

562
00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:48.000
industry by industry,
age by age, requirement

563
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.083
by requirement.

564
00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:51.000
It’s hard work and you
can’tjust make...

565
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.958
No disrespect to our politicians,
Steven, but the fact is the present

566
00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:57.500
government do like to make big
announcements for PR purposes

567
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.583
and we just need to do the graft
and the work first and actually

568
00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:04.833
accept that, sometimes,
it’s going to be difficult and,

569
00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:07.458
sometimes, you are going to say
things that are not popular

570
00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:11.041
but you just want to be respected,
not liked all the time and we must

571
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:13.208
stop those wanting to he
liked by the public.

572
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:16.083
Let’s get honest with them,
tell them how it’s going to be

573
00:29:16.083 --> 00:29:18.750
and then actually address difficult
issues that are going to be

574
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.291
difficult, but if you sure
you are working at it,

575
00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:23.125
people work with you.

576
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:25.000
George?

577
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.875
I express support for much
of what Theo just said and much

578
00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:34.041
of what the panel has said.

579
00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:38.041
I do think self—employment,
entrepreneurship, is going to be

580
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:41.000
necessary moving forward as so much
of our industry transforms.

581
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.708
We are dealing with a new society.

582
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:44.583
We go through it every time.

583
00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:47.208
We see someone, we think
we are going to shake hands,

584
00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:49.125
embrace, we don’t do these
things any more.

585
00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:51.625
There is so much
we don’t do any more.

586
00:29:51.625 --> 00:29:53.333
Look at the shape of the show.

587
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:56.208
So now is the time for us
to get creative, how we,

588
00:29:56.208 --> 00:29:57.875
as the incoming generation
into the workforce,

589
00:29:57.875 --> 00:30:02.083
are going to reshape the economy.

590
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:04.958
There are lots of hands up,
I’m going to come to some

591
00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:07.750
of you in a moment, butJess...

592
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:12.958
I mean, I agree almost
entirely with what Theo said

593
00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:17.666
in that the Government needs to act
now to stimulate the jobs sphere

594
00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:22.750
and the people going forward.

595
00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:25.666
They are going to be a lost
generation and, let’s face it,

596
00:30:25.666 --> 00:30:28.041
the young people today,
people who are under 30 today,

597
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:30.416
have pretty much lived their entire
economic lives,

598
00:30:30.416 --> 00:30:33.000
since the 2008 downturn,
and they’ve had to tighten

599
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.875
their belts and have lost out
on things that were there certainly

600
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:40.500
when I was younger and the reality

601
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.541
is that the Government needs
to announce, already have announced,

602
00:30:45.625 --> 00:30:48.208
what it is going to do to help
businesses get young

603
00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:50.208
people into training,
into schemes like Theo says,

604
00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:54.458
there can be different sectors,
different standards and it needs

605
00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:57.916
to be responsive, to what is
actually happening out there.

606
00:30:57.916 --> 00:31:00.041
Because, without it,
we’rejust going to end up

607
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:02.958
with a generation lost and,
even in the last week with regard

608
00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:08.083
to the tutoring that
schoolchildren will now get,

609
00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:14.583
very welcome announcement,
but an hour before the announcement

610
00:31:14.583 --> 00:31:19.166
was made, those aged 16—18
were taken out of it.

611
00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:24.375
And these are the people
who we are going to need to help,

612
00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:29.416
they have already lost
all their youth services,

613
00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:31.791
had their schools cut
for the entire time they might

614
00:31:31.791 --> 00:31:32.875
have been there.

615
00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:35.500
Now is the time to step up,
like Germany has already

616
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.250
announced stimulus packages,
and say what are we going to do

617
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.583
to create jobs and training
and to encourage businesses

618
00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:42.791
to take these people on?

619
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.208
Because these are our children.

620
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:48.375
Suresh.

621
00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:49.583
IONA: If I canjust...

622
00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:51.041
Iona, sorry, yes.

623
00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:56.250
I would say thatJess is absolutely
right to say that colleges that help

624
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.916
16 to 19—year—olds should be
included in the Covid catch up

625
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:10.791
fund and that, actually,
spending that little bit more time

626
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:12.458
in education could make
all the difference.

627
00:32:12.458 --> 00:32:15.333
So if we had targeted funding
for booster courses that just allows

628
00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:17.750
young people to build
up their skills before they go

629
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.708
into the labour market,
that could make all the difference

630
00:32:20.708 --> 00:32:22.333
between them being employable
and attractive workers,

631
00:32:22.333 --> 00:32:23.833
and being on the jobs scrapheap.

632
00:32:23.833 --> 00:32:26.708
But I also think that this issue
is too important to descend

633
00:32:26.708 --> 00:32:29.333
into party politics and we’ve been
hearing for a long time

634
00:32:29.333 --> 00:32:31.750
about the need for a commission
on social care because,

635
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.458
understandably, that’s
going to be extremely important

636
00:32:35.458 --> 00:32:38.333
to address after this crisis,
but I wonder whether we also need

637
00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:40.250
a commission on young people’s
opportunities and jobs.

638
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.333
For the parties to work together
and agree that they should be

639
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:47.625
a priority and debate the details
by all means, but try

640
00:32:47.625 --> 00:32:50.333
and transcend that party
politics and come together.

641
00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:52.750
50, Steve, lots of ideas
being thrown in your direction.

642
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.583
Targeted jobs for young people.

643
00:32:55.583 --> 00:32:57.666
Iona is talking about
a commission, more emphasis

644
00:32:57.666 --> 00:33:00.041
on entrepreneurship from Kirsty.

645
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:02.708
Well, on the one hand,
move quick, and on the other,

646
00:33:02.708 --> 00:33:05.958
have a commission to talk
about it more.

647
00:33:05.958 --> 00:33:08.333
I can assure Theo, there
is no shortage of graft

648
00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:11.000
in the Treasury and officials,
if you look at the schemes

649
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.375
they are putting in place
at speed, like the furlough,

650
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:14.833
the self—employment,
the grandson so forth,

651
00:33:14.833 --> 00:33:17.625
the grants amd so forth,

652
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.291
the self—employment,
the grants and so forth,

653
00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:22.416
have covered a lot to protectjobs,
but I absolutely agree that, then,

654
00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:26.000
the next phase to that is how then
for those jobs we are not able

655
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.125
to protect and the Chancellor
has been very candid,

656
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:29.375
we can’t protect everyjob.

657
00:33:29.375 --> 00:33:31.791
There will be changes
and as the questioner picked up,

658
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:33.958
there are changes in the way
people are working.

659
00:33:33.958 --> 00:33:37.541
The use of online, and if you look
at GPs, the percentage of GPs that

660
00:33:37.541 --> 00:33:40.416
are using online GP surgeries before
the pandemic, now it is up

661
00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:43.250
to 99%, pretty much all,
so there are changes to how people

662
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.333
are operating online.

663
00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:47.000
That will change the workplace
and we are in very active

664
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.833
discussions with employers,
particularly small and medium

665
00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:51.958
employers, to see what schemes
we can put in place to support them.

666
00:33:51.958 --> 00:33:54.583
But the first priority was protect
as manyjobs as possible.

667
00:33:54.583 --> 00:33:57.083
Over 9 million have been
through the furlough scheme,

668
00:33:57.083 --> 00:34:00.208
but we then need to look at the next
phase, which is how,

669
00:34:00.208 --> 00:34:01.750
particularly on things
like apprenticeships,

670
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.125
we get the right skills,
working with the National Citizen

671
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:09.375
service as well, to get the right
careers advice, the right skills

672
00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:12.750
and the right
training to get people

673
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:13.791
moving forward.

674
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:15.250
Sorry, can Ijustjump in?

675
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.666
I really want to commend
the Treasury for stepping in

676
00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:22.041
and providing so much support
under the furlough arrangements.

677
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:25.125
You mentioned that idea
of a commission for a young people

678
00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:29.416
being kind of "Talk about it more"
but I think there is something more

679
00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:34.291
to be said about focusing
on the opportunities

680
00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:37.375
and the challenges that will be
faced by this generation and getting

681
00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:38.750
some significant indication
of government commitment

682
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.916
to this issue.

683
00:34:40.916 --> 00:34:45.041
There are a number of issues,
especially when we talk

684
00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:49.041
about housing, it is a common
concern across this generation,

685
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:52.666
in which the Government has made
a lot of the right noises and talked

686
00:34:52.666 --> 00:34:55.541
about commitments
it is going to make.

687
00:34:55.541 --> 00:34:58.250
Not necessarily this government,
but this generation

688
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.083
of Conservative government.

689
00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:05.000
And we retroactively find
out that what has been

690
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.791
happening behind the scenes,
when there are no eyes

691
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:10.875
on the process, is flying
in the face of the sounds

692
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.750
you have been making.

693
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:18.750
Specifically what prompted me to say
that was the recent revelations

694
00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:23.250
about the RobertJenrick situation,
the Housing Minister,

695
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.000
that has come under fire for signing
off on a development,

696
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.666
a £1 billion development that looks
to undermined the provision

697
00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:34.041
to undermine the provision

698
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:36.958
of social housing in the community
that this thing is planned in.

699
00:35:36.958 --> 00:35:41.500
So I guess, as a generation,
we sometimes question the sincerity

700
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.541
with which you engage the challenges
of our age group and

701
00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:51.166
vulnerable communities.

702
00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:54.541
I know you want to come back
on this, we actually have a question

703
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:56.166
that addresses this point
from Luke McRoy—Jones.

704
00:35:56.166 --> 00:35:57.375
Luke.

705
00:35:57.375 --> 00:36:00.000
Hi, there.

706
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.083
Given the Covid—19 pandemic
has disproportionately

707
00:36:02.083 --> 00:36:04.666
affected certain groups,
including the young,

708
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:07.875
how should the Government ensure
there’s more support for social

709
00:36:07.875 --> 00:36:13.000
and affordable housing and possibly
less luxury apartments?

710
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:19.166
And, Luke, I assume you’re referring
to the Housing and Local Communities

711
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.583
Secretary RobertJenrick,
who has obviously been on the front

712
00:36:21.583 --> 00:36:24.458
pages of the papers for a few days
now, but this development

713
00:36:24.458 --> 00:36:27.625
in Tower Hamlets in London
which is now being reviewed,

714
00:36:27.625 --> 00:36:32.583
financed by Richard Desmond
and his company.

715
00:36:32.583 --> 00:36:35.416
The question is about should
the Government be doing more

716
00:36:35.416 --> 00:36:36.833
to support social
and affordable housing.

717
00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:37.875
Jess?

718
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:41.000
Well, yes.

719
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.166
Every government that has
existed since, I would say,

720
00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:48.291
probably the 19705 should have done
more to build social housing

721
00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:51.250
and to ensure that any stock
that was lost through the sale

722
00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:56.458
of social housing was replaced
at at least an equal value.

723
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.000
The Government, only in 2018,
allowed councils to borrow money

724
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.416
to build social housing,
which they had stopped in 2012.

725
00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:08.583
So for that entire period,
they had stopped councils

726
00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:12.250
being able to borrow money in order
to build council housing.

727
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:17.458
It was only lifted a couple of years
ago and I have absolutely no idea,

728
00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:26.500
idea why,

729
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.875
other than what it seems
is that what that does

730
00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:30.083
is give the whip hand

731
00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:32.750
to reach developers to be the only
people in the market

732
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.375
to rich developers to be the only
people in the market

733
00:37:35.375 --> 00:37:38.250
for house—building, and we can see
from the RobertJenrick affair how

734
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.833
powerful they actually are,
sending chummy text messages,

735
00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:44.958
talking about not giving money,
or "doe", is the term that was used,

736
00:37:44.958 --> 00:37:50.083
I believe, to the Marxists
in Tower Hamlets, which means

737
00:37:51.041 --> 00:37:53.666
the children and the adults that
would have used the hospitals

738
00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:55.833
and schools that that money
would have gone to.

739
00:37:55.833 --> 00:37:57.958
So, yes, they absolutely
need to be doing more.

740
00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:00.333
We all need to be doing more.

741
00:38:00.333 --> 00:38:02.958
I’m sure the Minister
on the panel will say,

742
00:38:02.958 --> 00:38:05.333
"We’ve done much more
than the Labour Party ever did,"

743
00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:10.500
it is a stock standard line
and come at you know what,

744
00:38:10.625 --> 00:38:13.958
it is a stock standard line and,
do you know what, the Labour Party

745
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:17.458
should have built more houses.

746
00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:20.041
And so should this government build
considerably more houses that people

747
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:21.500
can actually afford to live in.

748
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.583
Theo.

749
00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:24.791
Again, we are letting something
overshadow what is really

750
00:38:24.791 --> 00:38:28.375
going on out here at the moment
and there is no question in my mind

751
00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:31.708
that, as part of the reinvestment
to get the economy going and get us

752
00:38:31.708 --> 00:38:34.583
out of this mess that we are
undoubtedly going to get into,

753
00:38:34.583 --> 00:38:36.250
is a massive investment
in social housing.

754
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.375
And we must start a massive
programme of building,

755
00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:40.333
and boost the economy, create...

756
00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:42.041
I mean, there is a massive shortage.

757
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:44.833
It is not rocket science.

758
00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:50.000
There is a massive shortage,
we need to get people back at work,

759
00:38:51.833 --> 00:38:54.458
we need to invest where people need
it, so social housing

760
00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:56.583
is the obvious place
for us to go straight

761
00:38:56.583 --> 00:38:57.666
into, like now.

762
00:38:57.666 --> 00:39:00.041
Not requiring any more reports,
just get on with it.

763
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:03.125
Hannah, I can see
you want to come in.

764
00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:07.750
I completely agree that we need
more social housing.

765
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.333
People who live in social housing
in cramped conditions,

766
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:16.500
because there are no social housing
for them, and other underprivileged

767
00:39:18.875 --> 00:39:19.916
people,
die disproportionately

768
00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:21.791
from Covid—19 compared
to their more privileged peers.

769
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:25.791
Holly.

770
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:28.125
This seems like atypical
Conservative, the rich get richer

771
00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:30.166
and the poor get poorer.

772
00:39:30.166 --> 00:39:33.166
This shouldn’t be something
that is a secondary thought

773
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:36.250
about, these are people
that require houses.

774
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:41.375
This is one of the number one
priorities and, unfortunately,

775
00:39:41.833 --> 00:39:47.000
with Covid, it’s just gotten worse,
so stop promising us X, Y and Z

776
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:56.208
and actually go and build it.

777
00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:57.291
Suresh.

778
00:39:57.291 --> 00:39:59.708
I welcomed the demand in terms
of the Government investment

779
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:03.666
in the youth and social housing
and things like that,

780
00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:06.500
but I come to the point I made
at the beginning and

781
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.583
I agree with Theo.

782
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:11.166
To do and to fulfil those demands,
what we need to be doing is make

783
00:40:11.166 --> 00:40:13.041
sure the economy is restarted
in a proportionate

784
00:40:13.041 --> 00:40:14.125
and a sensible way.

785
00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:17.916
I think there’s been a lot of unfair
criticism to the Government by some

786
00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:21.083
of the panellists here and some

787
00:40:21.083 --> 00:40:22.166
of the other viewers.

788
00:40:22.166 --> 00:40:24.291
I think they should be
applauded for the furloughing

789
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:25.333
scheme they have done.

790
00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:26.583
This is an unprecedented situation.

791
00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:29.166
The only way they can
invest more is if they can

792
00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:30.208
get the economy going.

793
00:40:30.208 --> 00:40:35.000
Iona.

794
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.958
Well, the housing crisis in the UK
is extraordinarily complicated.

795
00:40:39.958 --> 00:40:43.833
AsJess said, it is one
that we have had for decades,

796
00:40:43.833 --> 00:40:45.708
that successive governments really
have failed to tackle

797
00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:46.833
comprehensively.

798
00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:50.541
When you look at these specific
case of RobertJenrick,

799
00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:53.166
I don’t want to comment
on the details of the case

800
00:40:53.166 --> 00:40:57.000
but what I do want to say is that,
in this country, the new build

801
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.458
housing industry needs to be held
to account for building homes

802
00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:04.875
that are overpriced,
to shoddy standards.

803
00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:08.583
And, in the last week,
we have seen a young couple

804
00:41:08.583 --> 00:41:11.250
in Leicestershire hanging a banner
from the front of their house

805
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.333
saying, "Buying this new build home
is the worst decision we ever made.

806
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:19.583
"Come and ask us why."

807
00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:24.208
Obviously, the developer wasn’t
happy about that and try to have it

808
00:41:24.208 --> 00:41:26.041
stopped but that was their
experience and, unfortunately,

809
00:41:26.041 --> 00:41:27.291
it is all too common.

810
00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:31.208
What we need is to have
really radical reform.

811
00:41:31.208 --> 00:41:34.541
To be fair, we hear a lot of sense
from the Government about how we are

812
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:38.958
from the Government about how we are
going to kick the planning laws into

813
00:41:38.958 --> 00:41:40.750
going to kick the planning laws into
touch, which is exactly what we

814
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.291
touch, which is exactly what we
need, we need to have reform of land

815
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:43.625
need, we need to have reform of land
value. So

816
00:41:43.625 --> 00:41:45.875
need, we need to have reform of land
value. 50 when developers buy up the

817
00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:46.958
value. So when developers buy up the
land, they get

818
00:41:46.958 --> 00:41:47.791
value. 50 when developers buy up the
land, they get all the benefits from

819
00:41:47.791 --> 00:41:50.541
land, they get all the benefits from
the gain in value of owning that

820
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.541
the gain in value of owning that
land. None of it is shared with the

821
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:55.833
land. None of it is shared with the
community. But what we need is to

822
00:41:55.833 --> 00:41:57.333
community. But what we need is to
share those profits with the

823
00:41:57.333 --> 00:41:59.500
share those profits with the
community so they can be invested

824
00:41:59.500 --> 00:41:59.875
community so they ran be invested
back into

825
00:41:59.875 --> 00:42:01.208
community so they can be invested
back into social and affordable

826
00:42:01.208 --> 00:42:03.458
back into social and affordable
housing and local infrastructure. To

827
00:42:03.458 --> 00:42:04.083
housing and [oral infrastmclure. To
be fair, the

828
00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:04.541
housing and local infrastructure. To
be fair, the community structure

829
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:05.666
be fair, the community stmcture
levy was

830
00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:06.833
be fair, the community structure
levy was supposed to do that.

831
00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:09.250
levy was supposed to do that.
However, all too often, it tends to

832
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.333
However, all too often, it tends to
be negotiated away by powerful

833
00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:12.500
be negotiated away by powerful
developers and councils gave in

834
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.041
developers and councils gave in
because they just want to get

835
00:42:14.041 --> 00:42:14.291
developers and councils gave in
because theyjust want to get more

836
00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:14.541
because they just want to get more
houses

837
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:15.791
because theyjust want to get more
houses built in the local area come

838
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:16.500
houses built in the [oral area come
what may. So

839
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.458
houses built in the local area come
what may. 50 that has not been

840
00:42:17.458 --> 00:42:18.000
what may. So that has not been
working and I

841
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.208
what may. 50 that has not been
working and I think that has been

842
00:42:19.208 --> 00:42:20.666
working and I think that has been
around longer than the current

843
00:42:20.666 --> 00:42:21.333
around longer than the current
Conservative generation of

844
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:25.041
Conservative generation of
politicians. George, obviously you

845
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:26.250
politicians. George, obviously you
have talked about the Robert

846
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.500
politicians. George, obviously you
have talked about the RobertJenrick

847
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:31.500
have talked about the RobertJenrick
situation already, but in terms of

848
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.250
situation already, but in terms of
social housing overall... Yes, for a

849
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.583
social housing overall... Yes, for a
while. As has been alluded to, the

850
00:42:35.583 --> 00:42:37.291
while. As has been alluded to, the
stock of social housing has been

851
00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:40.541
stock of social housing has been
slipping into the private sector. A

852
00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:41.875
slipping into the private sector. A
lot of the times, it is negotiations

853
00:42:41.875 --> 00:42:43.708
lot of the times, it is negotiations
the community have not been privy

854
00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:46.208
the community have not been privy
to. In 2018, the Government did

855
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:48.166
to. In 2018, the Government did
mandate that, for developments above

856
00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:50.375
mandate that, for developments above
a certain number, communities need

857
00:42:50.375 --> 00:42:52.916
a certain number, communities need
to be consulted. That is a welcome

858
00:42:52.916 --> 00:42:54.500
to be consulted. That is a welcome
change but there is something more

859
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.500
change but there is something more
pernicious that has been happening

860
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.625
pernicious that has been happening
in the reduction of the social

861
00:42:57.625 --> 00:43:00.208
in the reduction of the social
housing stock for a while. Quite a

862
00:43:00.208 --> 00:43:02.208
housing stock for a while. Quite a
few of you with hands up. Katie, you

863
00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:07.500
few of you with hands up. Katie, you
were nodding. I happen to live in an

864
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.541
were nodding. I happen to live in an
area of Worcestershire that has

865
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:10.291
area of Worcestershire that has
quite a lot of green belt. Whilst we

866
00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:11.375
quite a lot of green belt. whilst we
do need a

867
00:43:11.375 --> 00:43:11.583
quite a lot of green belt. Whilst we
do need a lot

868
00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:13.333
quite a lot of green belt. Whilst we
do need a lot more houses, we need

869
00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:15.708
do need a lot more houses, we need
to be quite environmental about it.

870
00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:17.666
to be quite environmental about it.
There are a lot of houses that are

871
00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:18.083
There are a lot of houses that are
mn down

872
00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:19.750
There are a lot of houses that are
run down and buildings that we could

873
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.916
mn down and buildings that we could
knock

874
00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:20.958
run down and buildings that we could
knock down and rebuild where they

875
00:43:20.958 --> 00:43:26.000
knock down and rebuild where they
are and make them better than the

876
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.541
are and make them better than the
new build are currently being built.

877
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:31.125
new build are currently being built.
So why on earth are contracts being

878
00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:33.625
So why on earth are contracts being
taken out on green belt, which

879
00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:34.708
taken out on green belt, which
should be protected environmentally,

880
00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:36.458
should be protected environmentally,
when there are brown belt places and

881
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:38.541
when there are brown belt places and
places that should be knocked down

882
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:40.458
places that should be knocked down
and built with better houses? Surely

883
00:43:40.458 --> 00:43:41.000
and built with better houses? Surely
that would make

884
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:41.958
and built with better houses? Surely
that would make better use of the

885
00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:47.208
that would make better use of the
space that is already there. Iman. I

886
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.375
space that is already there. Iman. I
also wanted

887
00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:49.916
space that is already there. Iman. I
also wanted to mention about rent

888
00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:51.208
also wanted to mention about rent
regulations. Especially in London,

889
00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:53.291
regulations. Especially in London,
rent is far too high for what people

890
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:54.166
rent is far too high for what peopla
are earning and

891
00:43:54.166 --> 00:43:54.833
rent is far too high for what people
are earning and I think the

892
00:43:54.833 --> 00:43:58.083
are earning and I think the
Government needs to do more for

893
00:43:58.083 --> 00:44:00.875
Government needs to do more for
people, because, as a young person,

894
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:02.333
people, because, as a young person,
it is almost impossible to save for

895
00:44:02.333 --> 00:44:04.833
it is almost impossible to save for
a deposit when I’m paying the rent

896
00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:06.875
a deposit when I’m paying the rent
in London that is extortion to high

897
00:44:06.875 --> 00:44:08.708
in London that is extortion to high
and trying to save for a deposit, so

898
00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:10.166
and trying to save for a deposit, so
I think rent regulations is another

899
00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:11.375
I think rent regulations is another
point the Government needs to look

900
00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:16.708
point the Government needs to look
into. Luca, you asked the question.

901
00:44:16.708 --> 00:44:16.791
point the Government needs to look
into. Luca, you asked the question.

902
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:18.416
into. Luca, you asked the question.
I think another important

903
00:44:18.416 --> 00:44:21.083
I think another important
consideration here is that the same

904
00:44:21.083 --> 00:44:22.458
consideration here is that the same
city that the £1 billion development

905
00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:24.375
city that the £1 billion development
was improved in was the same city

906
00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:25.958
was improved in was the same city
that three years ago to this month

907
00:44:25.958 --> 00:44:27.250
that three years ago to this month
at the Grenfell Tower tragedy and

908
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.250
at the Grenfell Tower tragedy and
still there are blocks in the UK

909
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.666
still there are blocks in the UK
wood cladding on deemed to be

910
00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:32.541
wood cladding on deemed to be
dangerous, so when is the Government

911
00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:34.416
dangerous, so when is the Government
actually going to act and protect

912
00:44:34.416 --> 00:44:34.875
actually going to act and protect
peopla in

913
00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:38.333
actually going to act and protect
people in this tower block housing?

914
00:44:38.333 --> 00:44:38.708
peopla in this tower block housing?
I don’t

915
00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:42.250
people in this tower block housing?
I don’t know if it has been covered,

916
00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:45.875
I don’t know if it has been covered,
but the CIO that Levy. The community

917
00:44:45.875 --> 00:44:47.750
but the CIO that Levy. The community
struck... Which is paid for by

918
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.916
struck... which is paid for by
developers

919
00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:49.875
struck... Which is paid for by
developers and goes to the council

920
00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:52.416
developers and goes to the council
to use for local service. In this

921
00:44:52.416 --> 00:44:52.708
to use for [oral service. In this
Robert jenrick

922
00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:54.833
to use for local service. In this
RobertJenrick case it is said the

923
00:44:54.833 --> 00:44:55.000
Robert jenrick rase it is said the
decision

924
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.083
RobertJenrick case it is said the
decision to green light that one

925
00:44:57.083 --> 00:44:58.541
decision to green light that one
billion development was fast—tracked

926
00:44:58.541 --> 00:45:00.458
billion development was fast-tracked
so as to help

927
00:45:00.458 --> 00:45:02.166
billion development was fast—tracked
so as to help the developer avoid a

928
00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:02.375
so as to help the developer avoid a
40

929
00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:05.125
so as to help the developer avoid 3
A0 million plus payment, into what

930
00:45:05.125 --> 00:45:05.291
40 million plus payment, into what
the

931
00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:06.750
A0 million plus payment, into what
the community, that levelly would

932
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.625
the community, that levelly would
have mandated. I would like to make

933
00:45:08.625 --> 00:45:09.458
have mandated. I would like to make
a clarify rare, I

934
00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:11.291
have mandated. I would like to make
a clarify care, I don’t think it was

935
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:11.458
a clarify rare, I don’t think it was
the

936
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:14.208
a clarify care, I don’t think it was
the Government that in 2018 decided

937
00:45:14.208 --> 00:45:15.875
the Government that in 2018 decided
communities should be consulted, I

938
00:45:15.875 --> 00:45:20.458
communities should be consulted, I
think it was the mayor. Steve. We

939
00:45:20.458 --> 00:45:23.291
think it was the mayor. Steve. We
need to built, build, build and that

940
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:24.750
need to built, build, build and that
means getting construction sites up

941
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.958
means getting constmction sites up
and mnning

942
00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:30.166
means getting construction sites up
and running we have been supported

943
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:32.125
and mnning we have been supported
them, but

944
00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:33.458
and running we have been supported
them, but planning is an impediment

945
00:45:33.458 --> 00:45:35.416
them, but planning is an impediment
is so we are planning to look at

946
00:45:35.416 --> 00:45:36.791
is so we are planning to look at
that in legislation and see what we

947
00:45:36.791 --> 00:45:37.416
that in lagislation and see what we
ran do to

948
00:45:37.416 --> 00:45:39.750
that in legislation and see what we
can do to speed that up. Katie is

949
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.000
ran do to speed that up. Katie is
worried

950
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.125
can do to speed that up. Katie is
worried about the green belt. We

951
00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:45.625
worried about the green belt. We
made very big investments into that,

952
00:45:45.625 --> 00:45:47.333
made very big investments into that,
in the budget as well. But I think

953
00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:49.458
in the budget as well. But I think
it is also looking about how we

954
00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:52.208
it is also looking about how we
build better, because one of the

955
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:56.000
build better, because one of the
things I am passionate about is

956
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.125
things I am passionate about is
modern methods of construction, how

957
00:45:57.125 --> 00:45:58.500
modern methods of constmction, how
we build quicker

958
00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.916
modern methods of construction, how
we build quicker it is better

959
00:45:59.916 --> 00:46:00.458
modern methods of construction, how
we build quicker it is betterfrom a

960
00:46:00.458 --> 00:46:00.791
we build quicker it is better from a
climate change

961
00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:01.291
we build quicker it is betterfrom a
climate change perspective. Energy

962
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:03.625
climate change perspective. Energy
use is lower so we can build better

963
00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:05.416
use is lower so we ran build better
as well, but

964
00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:06.333
use is lower so we can build better
as well, but the Government is

965
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:07.708
as well, but the Government is
investing, has committed significant

966
00:46:07.708 --> 00:46:09.916
investing, has committed significant
funds to this, in response to

967
00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:13.000
funds to this, in response to
Grenfell in particular, we committed

968
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.166
Grenfell in particular, we committed
at the budget additional funding to

969
00:46:14.166 --> 00:46:15.958
at the budget additional funding to
that, some of the schemes have been

970
00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:17.500
that, some of the schemes have been
slowed down because of Covid and the

971
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.791
slowed down because of Covid and the
difficulty of doing work on that, I

972
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:22.000
difficulty of doing work on that, I
was talking with one of

973
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.166
difficulty of doing work on that, I
was talking with one ofJess’s

974
00:46:22.166 --> 00:46:22.708
was talking with one of jess’s
colleagues

975
00:46:22.708 --> 00:46:23.416
was talking with one ofJess’s
colleagues about that

976
00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:23.750
was talking with one ofJess’s
colleagues about that just

977
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.541
colleagues about that just
yesterday, but we have committed

978
00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:26.916
yesterday, but we have committed
funding to that, we are committed to

979
00:46:26.916 --> 00:46:28.791
funding to that, we are committed to
build and one of the key things we

980
00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:30.291
build and one of the key things we
ran do

981
00:46:30.291 --> 00:46:31.791
build and one of the key things we
can do now is get construction sites

982
00:46:31.791 --> 00:46:32.000
ran do now is get constmction sites
“P

983
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.666
ran do now is get constmction sites
up and mnning

984
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:33.666
can do now is get construction sites
up and running so the industry can

985
00:46:33.666 --> 00:46:33.833
up and mnning so the industry ran
bounce

986
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:36.833
up and running so the industry can
bounce back. You have quite a job on

987
00:46:36.833 --> 00:46:39.250
bounce back. You have quite a job on
your hands, you have over a million

988
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.916
your hands, you have over a million
households on the social housing

989
00:46:40.916 --> 00:46:44.500
households on the social housing
waiting list and in 2018/19 in

990
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.250
waiting list and in 2018/19 in
England, 38,000 new social housing

991
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:49.125
England, 38,000 new social housing
units were built. That is a heck of

992
00:46:49.125 --> 00:46:51.666
units were built. That is a heck of
a discrepancy. That is why we have

993
00:46:51.666 --> 00:46:53.000
a discrepancy. That is why we have
presence thenned the safety net. One

994
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.958
presence thenned the safety net. One
of the measures we took was to

995
00:46:54.958 --> 00:46:57.125
of the measures we took was to
change the, the rent that is covered

996
00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:58.583
change the, the rent that is covered
to 30%, to support people in terms

997
00:46:58.583 --> 00:46:58.958
to 3096, to support peopla in terms
of the

998
00:46:58.958 --> 00:47:01.541
to 30%, to support people in terms
of the cost of rent, we have taken

999
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:02.791
of the cost of rent, we have taken
measures specifically about the

1000
00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:04.708
measures specifically about the
challenges of people paying their

1001
00:47:04.708 --> 00:47:05.000
challanges of peopla paying their
rent by

1002
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.541
challenges of people paying their
rent by providing protection for

1003
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:08.375
rent by providing protection for
five months but ultimately this is

1004
00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:10.000
five months but ultimately this is
the supply and demand issue. The key

1005
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.041
the supply and demand issue. The key
thing we need do is build more

1006
00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:13.708
thing we need do is build more
homes, we are committed to funding

1007
00:47:13.708 --> 00:47:17.000
homes, we are committed to funding
that, but we also need to make the

1008
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.708
that, but we also need to make the
planning system more friendly to

1009
00:47:18.708 --> 00:47:20.166
planning system more friendly to
delivering on that, and we also need

1010
00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:22.041
delivering on that, and we also need
to look a the skills and it comes

1011
00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:24.416
to look a the skills and it comes
back to the earlier point, you know,

1012
00:47:24.416 --> 00:47:25.041
back to the eartier point, you know,
skills for young

1013
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:27.083
back to the earlier point, you know,
skills for young people who we need

1014
00:47:27.083 --> 00:47:28.375
skills for young people who we need
to find employment for, the

1015
00:47:28.375 --> 00:47:29.708
to find employment for, the
construction industry is a key part

1016
00:47:29.708 --> 00:47:30.416
constmction industry is a key part
of that, the

1017
00:47:30.416 --> 00:47:31.208
construction industry is a key part
of that, the infrastructure we are

1018
00:47:31.208 --> 00:47:31.750
of that, the infrastmcture we are
committing,

1019
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.666
of that, the infrastructure we are
committing, and that is how we

1020
00:47:33.666 --> 00:47:35.208
committing, and that is how we
bounce back from the pandemic we

1021
00:47:35.208 --> 00:47:37.125
bounce back from the pandemic we
faced. Let us take another one from

1022
00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:42.083
faced. Let us take another one from
Emma.

1023
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.958
Emma.
The changes

1024
00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:49.750
What changes that we have made
in society in response

1025
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.875
to coronavirus should be kept once
restrictions are lifted?

1026
00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:54.416
Who wants to kick us off. Have you

1027
00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:55.208
who wants to kick us off. Have you
got one in mind

1028
00:47:55.208 --> 00:47:57.375
Who wants to kick us off. Have you
got one in mind Jess? There are some

1029
00:47:57.375 --> 00:47:57.958
got one in mind jess? There are some
things I have

1030
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.333
got one in mind Jess? There are some
things I have enjoyed about it. I

1031
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:01.708
things I have enjoyed about it. I
have enjoyed being home a bit more,

1032
00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:05.333
have enjoyed being home a bit more,
maybe we could move Westminster to

1033
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:06.250
maybe we could move Westminster to
Birmingham, post coronavirus, that

1034
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.125
Birmingham, post coronavims, that
would be good.

1035
00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:08.625
Birmingham, post coronavirus, that
would be good. Good luck with that.

1036
00:48:08.625 --> 00:48:10.833
would be good. Good luck with that.
There has been a couple of things

1037
00:48:10.833 --> 00:48:14.541
There has been a couple of things
actually, that we should keep, and I

1038
00:48:14.541 --> 00:48:16.916
actually, that we should keep, and I
think that, there will be an element

1039
00:48:16.916 --> 00:48:19.791
think that, there will be an element
of creativity that comes out of this

1040
00:48:19.791 --> 00:48:22.750
of creativity that comes out of this
in tech sectors and how we have

1041
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.166
in tech sectors and how we have
ﬂexibility, in

1042
00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.000
in tech sectors and how we have
flexibility, in our lives a bit

1043
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.416
ﬂexibility, in our lives a bit
more.

1044
00:48:25.416 --> 00:48:28.041
flexibility, in our lives a bit
more. Though I have for many years

1045
00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:30.000
more. Though I have for many years
been campaigning for flexibility,

1046
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.208
been campaigning for ﬂexibility,
day one,

1047
00:48:32.208 --> 00:48:33.000
been campaigning for flexibility,
day one, largely for working

1048
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.541
day one, largely for working
mothers, although it would account

1049
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:37.125
mothers, although it would account
for all working parents and you have

1050
00:48:37.125 --> 00:48:40.000
for all working parents and you have
been told no you count work from

1051
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.166
been told no you count work from
home, you wouldn’t be getting enough

1052
00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:42.625
home, you wouldn’t be getting enough
done and we have learned that is

1053
00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:45.125
done and we have learned that is
different now, we have learned we

1054
00:48:45.125 --> 00:48:45.875
different now, we have learned we
ran be as

1055
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:48.208
different now, we have learned we
can be as productive when we are at

1056
00:48:48.208 --> 00:48:49.083
ran be as productive when we are at
home, if not,

1057
00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:50.708
can be as productive when we are at
home, if not, but I also think, from

1058
00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:53.125
home, if not, but I also think, from
the perspective of somebody who

1059
00:48:53.125 --> 00:48:53.291
the perspective of somebody who
fares

1060
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:54.833
the perspective of somebody who
cares deeply about domestic violence

1061
00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:55.666
fares deeply about domestic violence
and

1062
00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:56.916
cares deeply about domestic violence
and vulnerable people in their home,

1063
00:48:56.916 --> 00:48:59.375
and vulnerable people in their home,
that for the first time the public

1064
00:48:59.375 --> 00:49:01.708
that for the first time the public
has sort of woken up to the idea of

1065
00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:03.708
has sort of woken up to the idea of
what it would be like to be

1066
00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:06.583
what it would be like to be
controlled, and to be a prisoner in

1067
00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:09.416
controlled, and to be a prisoner in
your own home, and I have seen a

1068
00:49:09.416 --> 00:49:11.666
your own home, and I have seen a
massive outpouring of support and

1069
00:49:11.666 --> 00:49:12.416
massive outpouring of support and
rare

1070
00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.916
massive outpouring of support and
care about that particular issue, as

1071
00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:15.083
rare about that particular issue, as
well as, a real

1072
00:49:15.083 --> 00:49:16.416
care about that particular issue, as
well as, a real love and support for

1073
00:49:16.416 --> 00:49:18.916
well as, a real love and support for
some of our key worker, people we

1074
00:49:18.916 --> 00:49:20.041
some of our key worker, people we
can’t actually live without, it

1075
00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:22.083
can’t actually live without, it
didn’t turn out to be the people who

1076
00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:22.208
didn’t turn out to be the peopla who
maybe

1077
00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:26.208
didn’t turn out to be the people who
maybe were getting paid the most, it

1078
00:49:26.208 --> 00:49:28.708
maybe were getting paid the most, it
turned out to be low

1079
00:49:28.708 --> 00:49:29.666
maybe were getting paid the most, it
turned out to below paid, key

1080
00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.000
turned out to be low paid, key
worker,

1081
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.041
turned out to below paid, key
worker, often migrant workers, and I

1082
00:49:31.041 --> 00:49:32.875
worker, often migrant workers, and I
think that there is a kindness in a

1083
00:49:32.875 --> 00:49:36.083
think that there is a kindness in a
community that has been born. Look,

1084
00:49:36.083 --> 00:49:43.791
community that has been born. Look,
hands up among the audience, Kofi.

1085

ﬂ

1086
00:49:49.875 --> 00:49:50.250
lam

1087
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.125
I am interested to know the regime
of wearing massings on public

1088
00:49:54.125 --> 00:49:57.458
of wearing massings on public
transport. Going forward in the

1089
00:49:57.458 --> 00:49:57.833
transport. Going forward in the
long-term

1090
00:49:57.833 --> 00:49:59.625
transport. Going forward in the
long—term would that be maintained

1091
00:49:59.625 --> 00:50:01.083
long-term would that be maintained
and will shops

1092
00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:03.250
long—term would that be maintained
and will shops and stalls and public

1093
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.041
and will shops and stalls and public
gather eings adopt a policy where we

1094
00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:08.000
gather eings adopt a policy where we
have to wear a mask if we want to be

1099
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.250
in a shop, and will there always
been a restricted number of people

1100
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:12.541
been a restricted number of people
who ran

1101
00:50:12.541 --> 00:50:15.000
been a restricted number of people
who can enter the gym at a time. Is

1102
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:15.750
who ran enter the gym at a time. Is
that something. . .

1103
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.291
who can enter the gym at a time. Is
that something... Is that something

1104
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:20.250
that something... Is that something
you want to see then, permanent you

1105
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.958
you want to see then, permanent you
know, a perm Nance to face

1106
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:28.166
know, a perm Nance to face
coveringings that sort of thing?

1107
00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:29.500
coveringings that sort of thing?
Yes, in particular, spaces, probably

1108
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.833
Yes, in particular, spaces, probably
like maybe shops and gyms and public

1109
00:50:31.833 --> 00:50:33.166
like maybe shops and gyms and public
transport, because when you are

1110
00:50:33.166 --> 00:50:34.791
transport, because when you are
coming into contact with so many

1111
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:35.375
coming into contact with so many
peopla like

1112
00:50:35.375 --> 00:50:36.958
coming into contact with so many
people like that, then we are still,

1113
00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:37.541
peopla like that, then we are still,
as far as,

1114
00:50:37.541 --> 00:50:38.958
people like that, then we are still,
as far as, there is a lot we don’t

1115
00:50:38.958 --> 00:50:40.916
as far as, there is a lot we don’t
know about it and its rates of

1116
00:50:40.916 --> 00:50:42.083
know about it and its rates of
transmission, it is important that

1117
00:50:42.083 --> 00:50:44.750
transmission, it is important that
we still have that protection and

1118
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.666
we still have that protection and
maintain sort of the policy as you

1119
00:50:46.666 --> 00:50:48.333
maintain sort of the policy as you
said, like this was a new normal.

1120
00:50:48.333 --> 00:50:49.916
said, like this was a new normal.
Ben? I

1121
00:50:49.916 --> 00:50:50.666
said, like this was a new normal.
Ben? Iagree

1122
00:50:50.666 --> 00:50:51.125
said, like this was a new normal.
Ben? I agree with what

1123
00:50:51.125 --> 00:50:51.791
said, like this was a new normal.
Ben? I agree with whatJess was

1124
00:50:51.791 --> 00:50:52.125
Ben? I agree with whatjess was
saying about

1125
00:50:52.125 --> 00:50:52.250
Ben? I agree with whatJess was
saying aboutjob

1126
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:53.541
Ben? I agree with whatJess was
saying about job flexibility.

1127
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:54.000
Ben? I agree with whatJess was
saying aboutjob flexibility. In the

1128
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.125
saying about job ﬂaxibility. In the
future

1129
00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:55.208
saying aboutjob flexibility. In the
future we will see more people

1130
00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:55.666
future we will see more peopla
working from

1131
00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.000
future we will see more people
working from home, certainly more of

1132
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.958
working from home, certainly more of
the time. I mean especially speaking

1133
00:50:58.958 --> 00:51:01.000
the time. I mean especially speaking
personally as a chemist, I work in a

1134
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
personally as a chemist, I work in a
lab every day but my company’s

1135
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.416
lab every day but my company’s
introduced a policy of working in

1136
00:51:05.416 --> 00:51:07.833
introduced a policy of working in
the lab now on alternative weeks and

1137
00:51:07.833 --> 00:51:09.375
the lab now on alternative weeks and
working from home on other weeks and

1138
00:51:09.375 --> 00:51:11.416
working from home on other weeks and
that has been working well, and so I

1139
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:12.875
that has been working well, and so I
definitely think we will be seeing

1140
00:51:12.875 --> 00:51:14.833
definitely think we will be seeing
that going forward. And another

1141
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:16.500
that going forward. And another
thing, hopefully, to see in the

1142
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.583
thing, hopefully, to see in the
future as well, is just better

1143
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:21.000
future as well, is just better
hygiene across the board because I

1144
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.500
hygiene across the board because I
think this pandemic has increased

1145
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.166
think this pandemic has increased
awareness of hygiene and good

1146
00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:26.291
awareness of hygiene and good
hygiene practises so I think that

1147
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:30.125
hygiene practises so I think that
will be a beneficial thing in the

1148
00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:32.583
will be a beneficial thing in the
future with hand San teaser. Will

1149
00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:33.458
future with hand San teaser. will
you be

1150
00:51:33.458 --> 00:51:35.041
future with hand San teaser. Will
you be washing your hands more, and

1151
00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:37.166
you be washing your hands more, and
what changes would you like to see

1152
00:51:37.166 --> 00:51:40.166
what changes would you like to see
made? We will never be the same

1153
00:51:40.166 --> 00:51:42.000
made? We will never be the same
again, technology has been changing

1154
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.083
again, technology has been changing
our lives over years now but over

1155
00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:49.041
our lives over years now but over
the last three months, I think,

1156
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:50.083
the last three months, I think,
technology, has been accelerated by

1157
00:51:50.083 --> 00:51:53.416
technology, has been accelerated by
at least five years in the way we

1158
00:51:53.416 --> 00:51:57.416
at least five years in the way we
adopted it and we are using it, for

1159
00:51:57.416 --> 00:51:59.583
adopted it and we are using it, for
me I can’t see myself having offices

1160
00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.041
me I can’t see myself having offices
with that many people in ever again.

1161
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:01.291
with that many peopla in ever again.
I

1162
00:52:01.291 --> 00:52:03.458
with that many people in ever again.
I mean the first thing we will be

1163
00:52:03.458 --> 00:52:04.833
I mean the first thing we will be
doing, speaking to colleagues, is

1164
00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:06.333
doing, speaking to colleagues, is
cutting down the number of days

1165
00:52:06.333 --> 00:52:06.416
cutting down the number of days
peopla

1166
00:52:06.416 --> 00:52:08.625
cutting down the number of days
people come into the offices which

1167
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.541
people come into the offices which
means we will need less espace,

1168
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:12.750
means we will need less espace,
people will will be able to balance

1169
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.916
peopla will will be able to balance
their

1170
00:52:12.916 --> 00:52:14.458
people will will be able to balance
their lives better and technology

1171
00:52:14.458 --> 00:52:16.000
their lives better and technology
has done that, retail will be

1172
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.791
has done that, retail will be
different as Westminster. People

1173
00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:19.000
different as Westminster. People
have adopted online a lot faster

1174
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
have adopted online a lot faster
than they would have done, so we are

1175
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
than they would have done, so we are
going to see more pressure on our

1176
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.500
going to see more pressure on our
high street stores and that is

1177
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.958
high street stores and that is
again, something the Government have

1178
00:52:25.958 --> 00:52:29.500
again, something the Government have
got to do something about and in the

1179
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.375
got to do something about and in the
rates deferral, holiday was

1180
00:52:31.375 --> 00:52:33.541
rates deferral, holiday was
brilliant, get rid of it. Don’t

1181
00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:35.083
brilliant, get rid of it. Don’t
bring it back, it don’t make sense.

1182
00:52:35.083 --> 00:52:40.500
bring it back, it don’t make sense.
It is a tax from the 15005, life’s

1183
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.500
It is a tax from the 15005, life’s
moved on, the internet did not exist

1184
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.916
moved on, the internet did not exist
in the 15005. 15005. You need to

1185
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:51.916
in the 15005. 15005. You need to
give our services but you have to do

1186
00:52:51.916 --> 00:52:54.000
give our services but you have to do
the work, get rid of it. It is

1187
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.500
the work, get rid of it. It is
destroying the fabric of society. 50

1188
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.625
destroying the fabric of society. So
lots of things will have to change.

1189
00:52:58.625 --> 00:53:03.916
lots of things will have to change.
What would you like to keep Iona? I

1190
00:53:03.916 --> 00:53:05.000
what would you like to keep Iona? I
agree working

1191
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.208
What would you like to keep Iona? I
agree working from home is more

1192
00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:07.791
agree working from home is more
civilised where possible but we

1193
00:53:07.791 --> 00:53:09.958
civilised where possible but we
should bear in mind that actually

1194
00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:13.583
should bear in mind that actually
young people do need hands on

1195
00:53:13.583 --> 00:53:14.583
young peopla do need hands on
training,

1196
00:53:14.583 --> 00:53:15.583
young people do need hands on
training, mentoring, in the

1197
00:53:15.583 --> 00:53:19.166
training, mentoring, in the
workplace, and you can’t bring on

1198
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:22.250
workplace, and you can’t bring on
all your interpersonal skills

1199
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:24.958
all your interpersonal skills
through Zoom. I am mentoring someone

1200
00:53:24.958 --> 00:53:27.000
through Zoom. I am mentoring someone
who is interrow verityed and shy and

1201
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.750
who is interrow verityed and shy and
it is difficult for her to become

1202
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.000
it is difficult for her to become
more confident talking to her

1203
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.375
more confident talking to her
colleagues online. I think that

1204
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.541
colleagues online. I think that
working from home has been a luxury

1205
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:35.000
working from home has been a luxury
that older people have been able to

1206
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.833
that older people have been able to
enjoy because they have had a lot of

1207
00:53:37.833 --> 00:53:40.125
enjoy because they have had a lot of
access to outdoor space perhaps and

1208
00:53:40.125 --> 00:53:41.000
access to outdoor space perhaps and
they have had better

1209
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:41.458
access to outdoor space perhaps and
they have had betterfacilities but

1210
00:53:41.458 --> 00:53:43.041
they have had better facilities but
younger

1211
00:53:43.041 --> 00:53:45.708
they have had betterfacilities but
younger people have been cooped up,

1212
00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:50.458
younger people have been cooped up,
typically... It is a balance. We

1213
00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:51.875
typically... It is a balance. We
maybe have to balance but in the

1214
00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:54.791
maybe have to balance but in the
future, we are going to have to by a

1215
00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:56.541
future, we are going to have to by a
saysed how we spend our money, prior

1216
00:53:56.541 --> 00:53:59.625
saysed how we spend our money, prior
your to this perhaps we had a

1217
00:53:59.625 --> 00:54:00.708
your to this perhaps we had a
buoyant consumer economy and

1218
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:02.375
buoyant consumer economy and
obviously we want, we want that to

1219
00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:04.458
obviously we want, we want that to
come back but at the same time

1220
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:07.375
come back but at the same time
individuals are looking at what they

1221
00:54:07.375 --> 00:54:09.000
individuals are looking at what they
spent their money on and are asking

1222
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.500
spent their money on and are asking
does this align with my value, did I

1223
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.291
does this align with my value, did I
need to boy that many clothes when I

1224
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:15.875
need to boy that many clothes when I
know what damage it does to the

1225
00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:17.166
know what damage it does to the
environment? But there are certain

1226
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:19.000
environment? But there are certain
things I want to come back, because

1227
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.916
things I want to come back, because
I don’t want to keep consuming my

1228
00:54:21.916 --> 00:54:24.333
I don’t want to keep consuming my
arts and culture on YouTube and

1229
00:54:24.333 --> 00:54:29.000
arts and culture on YouTube and
Zoom. We are facing a culture

1230
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.375
Zoom. We are facing a culture
disaster. What would you 0 keep

1231
00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:33.000
disaster. what would you o keep
George?

1232
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.333
disaster. What would you 0 keep
George? What would

1233
00:54:33.333 --> 00:54:36.000
disaster. What would you o keep
George? What would you keep? If you

1234
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.583
George? what would you keep? If you
have to pick

1235
00:54:36.583 --> 00:54:39.791
George? What would you keep? If you
have to pick one thing? I would

1236
00:54:39.791 --> 00:54:40.125
have to pick one thing? I would
keep, I

1237
00:54:40.125 --> 00:54:40.791
have to pick one thing? I would
keep, Iwould

1238
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:42.625
have to pick one thing? I would
keep, I would say, up swing in

1239
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:43.000
keep, I would say, up swing in
general rare,

1240
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.208
keep, I would say, up swing in
general care, and etiquette that we

1241
00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:44.875
general rare, and etiquette that we
have now,

1242
00:54:44.875 --> 00:54:46.666
general care, and etiquette that we
have now, understanding we are in a

1243
00:54:46.666 --> 00:54:48.416
have now, understanding we are in a
pandemic, understanding that people

1244
00:54:48.416 --> 00:54:48.583
pandemic, understanding that peopla
have

1245
00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:51.458
pandemic, understanding that people
have been endangered. I have felt

1246
00:54:51.458 --> 00:54:56.000
have been endangered. I have felt
that person—to—person has been a bit

1247
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.375
that person-to-person has been a bit
more sensitivity,

1248
00:54:56.375 --> 00:54:57.083
that person—to—person has been a bit
more sensitivity, and atentativeness

1249
00:54:57.083 --> 00:54:59.541
more sensitivity, and atentativeness
in how we check on each other and

1250
00:54:59.541 --> 00:55:01.041
in how we check on each other and
protect each other, especially from

1251
00:55:01.041 --> 00:55:03.666
protect each other, especially from
some of the online behaviours that

1252
00:55:03.666 --> 00:55:05.500
some of the online behaviours that
might affect our emotional and

1253
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.458
might affect our emotional and
mental wellbeing. Steve? What would

1254
00:55:08.458 --> 00:55:09.875
mental wellbeing. Steve? what would
you keep? For

1255
00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:10.750
mental wellbeing. Steve? What would
you keep? For me within Government

1256
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.041
you keep? For me within Government
it is the speed at which we act

1257
00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:15.833
it is the speed at which we act
across departments so if I look at

1258
00:55:15.833 --> 00:55:17.625
across departments so if I look at
the programme of getting food

1259
00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:19.375
the programme of getting food
parcels to the most vulnerable as

1260
00:55:19.375 --> 00:55:20.958
parcels to the most vulnerable as
part of the shielding programme, or

1261
00:55:20.958 --> 00:55:23.875
part of the shielding programme, or
the way we have been able to support

1262
00:55:23.875 --> 00:55:25.916
the way we have been able to support
the homeless through this crisis,

1263
00:55:25.916 --> 00:55:27.250
the homelass through this crisis,
get peopla

1264
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.250
the homeless through this crisis,
get people off the streets, we saw

1265
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.833
get people off the streets, we saw
the Government acting in a different

1266
00:55:31.833 --> 00:55:32.125
the Government acting in a different
“Y

1267
00:55:32.125 --> 00:55:33.000
the Government acting in a different
way to perhaps the traditional

1268
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.041
way to perhaps the traditional
model. There is a lot that comes

1269
00:55:35.041 --> 00:55:36.833
model. There is a lot that comes
from a pandemic where people come

1270
00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:39.083
from a pandemic where people come
together, with a common cause, act

1271
00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:41.666
together, with a common cause, act
much more quickly as Theo says in

1272
00:55:41.666 --> 00:55:43.166
much more quickly as Theo says in
being more data driven round where

1273
00:55:43.166 --> 00:55:45.916
being more data driven round where
the technology is being used for the

1274
00:55:45.916 --> 00:55:47.750
the technology is being used for the
benefit of people, there is ways

1275
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.041
benefit of people, there is ways
that Government can operate, coming

1276
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:49.541
that Government ran operate, coming
out of the

1277
00:55:49.541 --> 00:55:50.500
that Government can operate, coming
out of the pandemic, where we can

1278
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.125
out of the pandemic, where we ran
move much

1279
00:55:51.125 --> 00:55:52.250
out of the pandemic, where we can
move much more quickly and be more

1280
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:54.916
move much more quickly and be more
data driven. Taking your Government

1281
00:55:54.916 --> 00:55:57.916
data driven. Taking your Government
hat off, on a personal level, what

1282
00:55:57.916 --> 00:56:01.083
hat off, on a personal level, what
you would you keep? As someone with

1283
00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:03.583
you would you keep? As someone with
two children under ten, seeing more

1284
00:56:03.583 --> 00:56:05.083
two children under ten, seeing more
of the family with that

1285
00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:06.083
of the family with that
home—working, all of us in

00:56:06.083 --> 00:56:08.291
home—working, all of us in
Parliament spend a lot of time away

1287
00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:09.000
Partiament spend a lot of time away
from home,

1288
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.166
Parliament spend a lot of time away
from home, so

1289
00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:09.375
Parliament spend a lot of time away
from home, sol

1290
00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:10.083
Parliament spend a lot of time away
from home, so I think actually

1291
00:56:10.083 --> 00:56:11.833
from home, so I think actually
that’s a expect is something I

1292
00:56:11.833 --> 00:56:14.500
that’s a expect is something I
really enjoyed and many of us, the

1293
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:14.791
really enjoyed and many of us, the
ﬂexibility

1294
00:56:14.791 --> 00:56:15.833
really enjoyed and many of us, the
flexibility round that will be great

1295
00:56:15.833 --> 00:56:17.500
ﬂexibility round that will be great
to keep. On a

1296
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.375
flexibility round that will be great
to keep. On a frivolous note, I have

1297
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:21.250
to keep. On a frivolous note, I have
to say the one thingly look forward

1298
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.208
to say the one thingly look forward
to is not having to queue in the bar

1299
00:56:23.208 --> 00:56:27.208
to is not having to queue in the bar
at the pub. If you can sit at the

1300
00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:27.583

table and

1301
00:56:27.583 --> 00:56:28.625

1302
00:56:28.625 --> 00:56:30.000

00:56:37.708 --> 00:56:40.791

important to keep is Spotlight on
