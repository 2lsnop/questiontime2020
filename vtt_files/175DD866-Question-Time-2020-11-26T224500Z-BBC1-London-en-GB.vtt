1
00:00:02.661 --> 00:00:06.286
and this is where we are more likely
to have the fog, that is where

2
00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.661
we have the yellow fog
warning from the Met Office

3
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:09.702
into the morning.

4
00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:11.869
The fog dense in places,
lifting into low cloud,

5
00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.952
may be thinning in the afternoon
and brightening up, but on the whole

6
00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:16.869
it looks cloudy and dry
during the afternoon.

7
00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.036
To the north of London,
towards the Home Counties,

8
00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:20.702
temperatures may be no
better than 3—4C.

9
00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:22.744
Looking further ahead,
the weekend and beyond,

10
00:00:22.744 --> 00:00:26.577
it will be milder but it looks
like there will be a lot of cloud.

11
00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.327
The national picture is with Ben.

12
00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:37.577
Good evening. It

13
00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:44.452
Good evening. It is getting pretty
murky out there stop we have fog

14
00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:45.911
murky out there stop we have fog
developing at the moment,

15
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.869
developing at the moment,
particularly across parts of England

16
00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:48.077
particularty across parts of England
and

17
00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:49.327
particularly across parts of England
and Wales. This was the scene in

18
00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:49.786
and Wales. This was the scene in
Norfolk a

19
00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:51.369
and Wales. This was the scene in
Norfolk 3 short time ago. We have

20
00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.744
Norfolk a short time ago. We have
two

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:53.202
Norfolk 3 short time ago. We have
two weatherfronts, one

both producing a little bit of
patchy rain, but in between in this

patchy rain, but in between in this
9’P-

30
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:02.286
patchy rain, but in between in this
gap, with very like winds and clear

31
00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:03.786
gap, with very like winds and clear
skies, that’s where the fog is

32
00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:04.702
skies, that’s where the fog is
developing. It’s where we’ve got

33
00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:06.286
developing. It’s where we’ve got
some pretty low temperatures,

34
00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:07.911
some pretty low temperatures,
dropping below freezing and quite a

dropping below freezing and quite a
few places through tonight. The fog

36
00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:11.702
few places through tonight. The fog
most likely across parts of East

most likely across parts of East
Walas,

38
00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:13.827
most likely across parts of East

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:18.786
parts of northern England as well,
and where you have the fog tomorrow

43
00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:21.369
and where you have the fog tomorrow
morning it will take a while to

44
00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:21.494
morning it will take a whila to
clear.

45
00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:23.786
morning it will take a while to
clear. Some spots will stay grey and

46
00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:24.077
dear. Some spots will stay grey and
murky

47
00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:25.202
clear. Some spots will stay grey and
murky all day long. The weather

48
00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:26.577
murky all day long. The weather
fronts I showed you are bringing

49
00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:29.536
fronts I showed you are bringing
some patchy rain across Scotland and

50
00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:30.786
some patchy rain across Scotland and
Northern Ireland and a little bit

51

Northern Ireland and a little bit
pushing into southern counties of

52
00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.327
pushing into southern counties of
England later in the day. If you

53
00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.536
England later in the day. If you
keep fog all day long you might get

54
00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:37.952
keep fog all day long you might get
to three or

55
00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:38.244
keep fog all day long you might get
to three orfour

56
00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:39.369
keep fog all day long you might get
to three or four micro degrees, even

57
00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.036
to three or four micro degrees, even
in brightness 8-9

58
00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.077
to three or four micro degrees, even
in brightness 8—9 is the best we can

59
00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:42.661
in brightness 8-9 is the best we ran
expect. During

60
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:44.119
in brightness 8—9 is the best we can
expect. During Friday night the fog

61
00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.244
expect. During Friday night the fog
will redevelop across parts of

62
00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:46.327
will redevelop across parts of
England and Wales. Some rain across

63
00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:46.619
England and Walas. Some rain across
Scotland

64
00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.244
England and Wales. Some rain across
Scotland but pushing northwards

65
00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:49.202
Scotland but pushing northwards
allows some sunshine to develop on

66
00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:51.202
allows some sunshine to develop on
Saturday. For Northern Ireland for a

67
00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:53.327
Saturday. For Northern Ireland for a
time as well. England and Wales,

68
00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:53.411
time as well. England and Walas,
after

69
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:55.161
time as well. England and Wales,
after what could be a foggy start,

70
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:58.119
after what could be a foggy start,
is likely to stay grey and cloudy, a

71
00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.619
is likely to stay grey and cloudy, a
little bit milder towards the south

72
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.327
little bit milder towards the south
and a similar day

SEDATE ELECTRONIC MUSIC

74
00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:19.411
Lord, may you protect
your servant Leroy.

75
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.911
Please keep him safe
for his police training

76
00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:23.744
and grant us the wisdom

77
00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.452
to accept his decision.

78
00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:29.827
Out there, it is us and them.

79
00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:32.036
That’s how it works.

80
00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:35.661
Sometimes I think
the earth needs to be scorched...

81
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:37.577
..so something good will come of it.

82
00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:14.494

99
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.286
Good evening, welcome to my guests
here in the studio and to Vaughan

100
00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:11.161
and Tanni who arejoining us down
the line and of course

101
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:13.411
to our Virtual audience,
tonight you are from Swansea,

102
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:16.202
thank you very much forjoining us
for the programme this evening

103
00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:18.369
and of course thanks
to you forjoining us

104
00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:20.994
at home and for watching

105
00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.661
in the conversation,
you can do it in the usual way,

106
00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:25.619
@bbcquestiontime, and on social
media and let’s hear

107
00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:26.994
what you have got to say.

108
00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:28.952
Right, we will start
with ourfirst question,

109
00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:30.577
which is from Mikejones.

110
00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:32.286
Thanks, Fiona.

111
00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:36.619
As BorisJohnson has announced
severe tier levels in England,

112
00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.952
should we alljust be as strict
as possible and buckle down to avoid

113
00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:43.536
another spike early in the New Year?

114
00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:45.577
Tanni.

115
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.244
Do you want to start us off?

116
00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:51.286
Yeah, I think this is incredible.

117
00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:54.077
I think the good thing
about Christmas is that everyone

118
00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:57.369
is agreed on what we should be doing
in terms of lockdown.

119
00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:00.952
I think the guidance
is really important,

120
00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:04.119
but the tier system is a reaction
to the R rate going up

121
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:08.744
and I think it is important.

122
00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:11.452
My worry over Christmas
is that it willjust get very

123
00:05:11.452 --> 00:05:13.661
complicated in January,
February, March and there could be

124
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.661
a huge lockdown for everybody
and I think people are tired,

125
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.869
they are exhausted with,
you know working at home,

126
00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.244
we are living at work,
and the mental health pressures

127
00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:25.119
on people are going to be huge.

128
00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:28.869
So, it is incredibly important that
I think people are really

129
00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.494
sensible over Christmas,
you know, they are not going to be

130
00:05:31.494 --> 00:05:34.036
stupid, they have to take some
personal responsibility with this,

131
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:37.661
but we are a long way from getting
a vaccine and being out of this

132
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.452
and on the other side.

133
00:05:40.452 --> 00:05:42.619
I think it is quite hard,
actually, when every

134
00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:45.786
part of the country,
potentially, has different levels,

135
00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:47.911
to actually understand
what you can and cannot do,

136
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.994
because the guidance gets quite
complicated in terms of crossing

137
00:05:50.994 --> 00:05:54.286
borders and regions and areas
and I know where I live we were told

138
00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:57.036
in the previous lockdown
that it was County Durham and then

139
00:05:57.036 --> 00:06:01.661
it turned out it was
the Durham County.

140
00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.744
I think everyone has got to be
really, really clear on what those

141
00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:05.786
levels mean to individuals.

142
00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:10.161
And you are in Tier 3
as of next week, Tanni.

143
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.661
Nadhim, the question is should
we all be as strict as possible,

144
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:17.494
I mean 99% of England is under Tier
2 and Tier 3 now, is this another

145
00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:20.536
lockdown by another name?

146
00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:23.827
Well, if you look at Tier 2 and Tier
3, you are absolutely right,

147
00:06:23.827 --> 00:06:26.786
they have been tightened up,
but retail will reopen.

148
00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:31.411
People can go to the gym,
clearly there are differences

149
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:33.577
and people should obviously look
at gov.uk to see

150
00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:36.827
where their area is.

151
00:06:36.827 --> 00:06:40.161
They are tougher, the R number has
been coming down and it is now

152
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:42.327
between one and 1.1,
it was 1.3 before the

153
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:47.119
national interventions
in England were introduced.

154
00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:49.286
between one and 1.1,
it was 1.3 before the

155
00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:50.702
national interventions
in England were introduced.

156
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.119
That will end on the 2nd
of December and this

157
00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:54.327
new tiering system will apply.

158
00:06:54.327 --> 00:06:56.952
Look, I think the combination
of community testing which we saw

159
00:06:56.952 --> 00:06:59.577
worked really well in Liverpool
and Liverpool is a great example

160
00:06:59.577 --> 00:07:01.577
of the local leadership
working with the government

161
00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:06.577
to get this right.

162
00:07:09.327 --> 00:07:11.577
They are in Tier 2
I think a positive.

163
00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:15.202
In other areas, like my area, sadly,
in the West Midlands, we are in Tier

164
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:20.202
3 and although Stratford—upon—Avon
has a low infection rate

165
00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:23.202
per 100,000, the surrounding area
of Solihull and North Warwickshire

166
00:07:23.202 --> 00:07:26.244
is much higher, so we have
had to go into Tier 3.

167
00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:29.411
And can I ask you about the mass
testing, because the Prime Minister

168
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:32.952
gave a press conference today
at five o’clock and he said,

169
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.619
the previous tier systems slow
down infection rates.

170
00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.702
Mass testing could allow
individuals to be released

171
00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:42.536
from certain restrictions,
even if they are living in Tier 3.

172
00:07:42.536 --> 00:07:44.119
What did he mean by that?

173
00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:48.536
Did he mean...

174
00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:51.161
We are talking about individuals,
everyone in Tier 3 coming out

175
00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:53.327
in a particular region,
but individuals within Tier 3

176
00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:54.994
could get a test and then, what?

177
00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:56.036
Have people round?

178
00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:57.036
What did he mean?

179
00:07:57.036 --> 00:07:59.702
So, the pilot that was run
in Liverpool, which I think

180
00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:02.036
is really important,
is, if you are then tested

181
00:08:02.036 --> 00:08:07.036
every day for five days,
if you were someone who has been

182
00:08:11.744 --> 00:08:14.452
notified through test and trace
of someone who has the infection

183
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.536
that you have been close to,
then you do not have to quarantine.

184
00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:18.744
That is a big change.

185
00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:22.619
So, the people who are in Tier 3
as of next week, let us be clear,

186
00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:25.161
because this was new information
this afternoon, that is 23 million

187
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:28.911
people, if they are in Tier 3 next
week, they have to be,

188
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:32.702
what, tested for five days in a row
and then they are free to do

189
00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:37.452
what they want or what did
he mean exactly?

190
00:08:37.452 --> 00:08:40.327
The pilot that was run
in Liverpool was around,

191
00:08:40.327 --> 00:08:44.994
if you are notified that you have
been in contact with someone who has

192
00:08:44.994 --> 00:08:47.286
tested positive for coronavirus,
at the moment you would

193
00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:50.161
have to quarantine.

194
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:52.744
As the Prime Minister is doing.

195
00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:54.494
If you, as we did in Liverpool...

196
00:08:54.494 --> 00:08:56.952
Isn’t that a different
thing, though?

197
00:08:56.952 --> 00:08:59.994
I just want to be really clear,
because it really struck me,

198
00:08:59.994 --> 00:09:02.661
if the Prime Minister is saying that
mass testing could allow

199
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:04.327
individuals to be released
from certain restrictions,

200
00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:07.411
even when they are in Tier 3,
he is saying that people that

201
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:10.702
have a negative test can live
in a different way to those who have

202
00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:14.494
not had a negative test or haven’t
even been tested at all in Tier 3,

203
00:09:14.494 --> 00:09:17.661
is that what he means?

204
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:20.452
No, I think the restriction
is the quarantine issue.

205
00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:24.452
So, if you are, as we have
just done in Liverpool,

206
00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:26.369
if you get notified,
you have to quarantine,

207
00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:30.869
therefore further restrictions
on your ability to move around.

208
00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:34.536
If you get a test every day
and you test negative,

209
00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:37.369
then you don’t have to quarantine
and that is being delivered through

210
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.577
this pilot community testing.

211
00:09:39.577 --> 00:09:42.619
But that is true everywhere,
notjust here three.

212
00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:44.536
He was just referring to Tier 3.

213
00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:47.661
The reason he was referring to Tier
3 is because we are focusing

214
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:49.536
community testing on Tier 3 areas.

215
00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:51.869
Claire.

216
00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:56.536
Should we all be as strict
as possible and buckle down?

217
00:09:56.536 --> 00:09:59.244
When we were told that we had
to accept the lockdown,

218
00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:02.161
which a lot of people felt very
unhappy about, felt that there

219
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:04.911
was not enough evidence
for national lockdown,

220
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:08.077
it was very much on the assumption
that we would leave the lockdown

221
00:10:08.077 --> 00:10:11.786
and things might have improved.

222
00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:15.411
The reality is that over 23 million
people who had previously been

223
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:18.286
living under Tier1 had gone
into lockdown and have now come

224
00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:21.536
out in higher tiers.

225
00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:24.577
It feels like perpetual
punishment and even the way

226
00:10:24.577 --> 00:10:28.661
we are talking about it,
you know, a kind of release

227
00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.786
from certain restrictions, you know,
whether the Prime Minister

228
00:10:31.786 --> 00:10:34.911
will allow us, if we buckle down,
and then we can have Christmas,

229
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:39.952
then the whole discussion around
Christmas has been very

230
00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:42.744
much, you know, well,
we are going to indulge you people

231
00:10:42.744 --> 00:10:44.869
who want Christmas with their
families for five days,

232
00:10:44.869 --> 00:10:47.119
but you are going to pay for it.

233
00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:51.411
And I am afraid that the problem
for me with this whole discussion

234
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.536
is that we are free,
we are supposed to live in a free

235
00:10:54.536 --> 00:10:57.661
society, a democracy,
but we are behaving as though

236
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:01.369
we are in a pre—democratic time
with some kind of fiefdom announcing

237
00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:05.161
and micromanaging exactly
what we should do.

238
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:08.744
I think it is the opposite
of getting consent,

239
00:11:08.744 --> 00:11:11.202
of bringing about trust,
of encouraging people to take

240
00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:14.411
themselves seriously,
because we are literally having

241
00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:19.411
discussions like this,
technocratic, would it meanness?

242
00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:21.661
Does it mean that?

243
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:23.827
Should I dot the i and cross the t?

244
00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:26.494
Given that we are in a pandemic,
what is the alternative?

245
00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:28.661
Yes, but there are ways
of dealing with pandemics,

246
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:30.369
lots of different possibilities.

247
00:11:30.369 --> 00:11:32.744
Claire, you saw the response
from Liverpool and the community

248
00:11:32.744 --> 00:11:35.161
in Liverpool and people actually
coming out and working together

249
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:38.202
and they have done really well.

250
00:11:38.202 --> 00:11:43.202
Yes, but social solidarity requires
that people do not believe that

251
00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:46.661
arbitrarily their freedoms are taken
away from them and there

252
00:11:46.661 --> 00:11:50.994
is no balance of risks.

253
00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:53.869
The only thing that we face
at the moment is, you know,

254
00:11:53.869 --> 00:11:56.786
you say we are in a pandemic,
we are in a pandemic,

255
00:11:56.786 --> 00:11:59.869
we also undoubtedly will
talk about the economy.

256
00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:03.161
That pandemic is one
of the things facing the society,

257
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:07.286
as are very many others and the way
we have responded to that pandemic

258
00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:12.327
has created a tsunami,
a pandemic, of unemployment,

259
00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.452
of immiseration, of isolation,
of the robbing of autonomy

260
00:12:22.452 --> 00:12:25.786
and of our freedoms and of our civil
liberties and at the very least

261
00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:28.661
I should be able to say that
without the inference being that

262
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:31.077
I have not noticed we are
living in a pandemic.

263
00:12:31.077 --> 00:12:33.952
I think it is important
and I think also, by the way,

264
00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:36.869
many of the local authorities that
are now going to have higher

265
00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:38.577
tiers is actually falling
rates of coronavirus.

266
00:12:38.577 --> 00:12:41.244
Death rates are going down
in relation to what they were.

267
00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:44.661
So, what I am saying is,
we are told if only we accept this

268
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:46.202
particular hard measure,
all will be well.

269
00:12:46.202 --> 00:12:49.577
Well, we have just had a lockdown,
we are not even out of it

270
00:12:49.577 --> 00:12:52.661
and now we are being told,
we are going to have hard tiering

271
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:55.577
and we have got to behave,
otherwise we will not have Christmas

272
00:12:55.577 --> 00:12:58.202
and then at Christmas you have got
to be sensible otherwise

273
00:12:58.202 --> 00:12:59.911
you are going to pay for it.

274
00:12:59.911 --> 00:13:02.577
It is like some sort of religious
cult we have entered

275
00:13:02.577 --> 00:13:05.411
into and the one thing that nobody
discusses is what this does

276
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:08.786
for freedom and democracy in society
and I really think that is a very

277
00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:11.411
serious price to pay and should
at least be debated fully.

278
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:15.869
Well, let us see what our audience
are thinking in Swansea.

279
00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:17.119
Gemma.

280
00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:20.244
Yes, thank you, Ijust wanted to say
I don’t really see how

281
00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:21.452
these tiers work at all.

282
00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:24.619
I think we were in 3 tier system
and that resulted in us

283
00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:26.536
going into another lockdown
and a in Wales.

284
00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:28.869
I think the lockdown in March
was far more effective

285
00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:31.327
because there was one rule
for everybody and we knew

286
00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:34.661
what we had to do, but with all
these different tiers I just think

287
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:37.452
it adds confusion.

288
00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:40.577
I am from a small valley
where there has been a spike

289
00:13:40.577 --> 00:13:43.661
in cases and I think we need
to protect people in areas

290
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:47.286
with the cases are low to make sure
that we do not get any cases

291
00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:48.994
escalating in those areas.

292
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:51.411
Claire.

293
00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:52.744
Thank you, Fiona.

294
00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:55.161
I think it is all very confusing.

295
00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:58.494
I think it is all open
to interpretation and it

296
00:13:58.494 --> 00:14:01.661
all boils down to trust.

297
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:04.911
I think trust is really important.

298
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:09.869
Here in Wales, the firebreak
lockdown clearly worked,

299
00:14:10.244 --> 00:14:15.286
numbers were falling,
ten consecutive days,

300
00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:20.244
numbers were falling and then
recently numbers have started

301
00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:25.952
to increase and that is mainly
in the under 255 group and I think

302
00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:29.536
that the message has to go out loud
and clear that everybody has a part

303
00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:34.536
to play and trust is key,
trust is essential.

304
00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:38.786
So, everybody has to be prepared
to take part and do their bit.

305
00:14:38.786 --> 00:14:41.202
Of course, you are living under
different rules in Wales,

306
00:14:41.202 --> 00:14:43.161
Claire, are you saying
that they are confusing?

307
00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:46.952
I think our rules in Wales are quite
straightforward, actually,

308
00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:50.244
but listening to all the different
tier system is and where you can go

309
00:14:50.244 --> 00:14:53.161
and where you can eat
and where you can go to socialise

310
00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:55.744
and who could socialise,
listening to some of my friends

311
00:14:55.744 --> 00:14:58.661
and colleagues in the different tier
systems in England, it is quite

312
00:14:58.661 --> 00:15:03.661
baffling at times and I think
even they are confused.

313
00:15:06.036 --> 00:15:07.452
So, I think we need clarity.

314
00:15:07.452 --> 00:15:08.536
And Michael.

315
00:15:08.536 --> 00:15:09.577
Michael B.

316
00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:10.577
Hello.

317
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.619
Thank you.

318
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.244
I just wanted to say,
is it really worth the potential

319
00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:16.661
oppression and depression that
spending time at the family over

320
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:18.827
Christmas that we could lead
into a potential third

321
00:15:18.827 --> 00:15:23.786
wave of coronavirus?

322
00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:27.994
Is it really worth
that potential risk?

323
00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:31.161
So, as far as you are concerned,
it would be betterfor us

324
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.327
to stay apart at Christmas?

325
00:15:32.327 --> 00:15:33.369
I think so, yes.

326
00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:36.702
I think we are coming into January,
it is probably one of the most

327
00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:39.119
depressing months in the year
and then we are probably

328
00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:40.161
going into another lockdown.

329
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:45.202
Is that really worth it for spending
a few days with family?

330
00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:47.536
Vaughan?

331
00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:49.244
Vaughan Gething?

332
00:15:49.244 --> 00:15:51.661
Well, these are incredibly difficult
choices for all of us,

333
00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:53.619
whether we are members
of the public, going

334
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.994
about living our lives,
front line health and care staff,

335
00:15:55.994 --> 00:15:58.661
who are looking after us
all and indeed politicians like me,

336
00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:00.869
a Health Minister with some
responsibility for more

337
00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:03.661
than 3 million souls here in Wales.

338
00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:06.036
There is nothing glib,
we are not looking to take

339
00:16:06.036 --> 00:16:10.077
away people’s liberties.

340
00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:12.911
We are looking to do the right
thing, to keep while safe

341
00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:14.827
and to protect as many
lives as possible.

342
00:16:14.827 --> 00:16:16.536
The rules are only part of that.

343
00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:19.661
What we are really trying to do
is to help people to think

344
00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:20.827
about what we should do.

345
00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:22.744
The firebreak did work,
it did significantly reduce

346
00:16:22.744 --> 00:16:24.786
the numbers of infections.

347
00:16:24.786 --> 00:16:27.619
It saw a flat line,
but they are starting to rise again

348
00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:30.327
and as we see that extra mix
in those extra cases,

349
00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:34.161
that means more people coming
into our hospitals and it means more

350
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:39.161
people who will not come out
of hospitals and the infection rates

351
00:16:46.577 --> 00:16:48.661
that are rising in under 255
will eventually translate

352
00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:51.827
into people over the age of 60
and they are much more likely

353
00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:52.869
to come to harm.

354
00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:55.036
So, our real challenge
is understanding how people behave,

355
00:16:55.036 --> 00:16:58.411
how we help people to make different
choices and to accept that we cannot

356
00:16:58.411 --> 00:16:59.786
micromanage every situation,
but our responsibility,

357
00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:03.411
we clear up what we want people
to do and there are times we set

358
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:04.869
harder rules about what can happen.

359
00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.952
We have got a much bigger testing
programme now than what we had

360
00:17:07.952 --> 00:17:11.369
at the start and here in Wales
we have got a very effective test,

361
00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:14.702
trace and protect system that
in the last week up to 92% of index

362
00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:16.411
cases and 82% of their contacts.

363
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:22.119
And, Vaughan, you talk
about the fact that cases

364
00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.286
are beginning to rise again.

365
00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:25.702
I mean, looking at Blaenau Gwent,
for example, you’ve got

366
00:17:25.702 --> 00:17:26.744
A10 cases per 100,000.

367
00:17:26.744 --> 00:17:29.536
But two households can meet,
pubs and restaurants are open.

368
00:17:29.536 --> 00:17:33.869
Whereas in Manchester, for example,
there are 250 cases per 100,000

369
00:17:33.869 --> 00:17:36.827
and pubs and restaurants are shut,
except for takeaway.

370
00:17:36.827 --> 00:17:39.702
I know that you’ve been meeting
today to talk about next step

371
00:17:39.702 --> 00:17:41.661
for the Welsh Government,
are you envisaging tighter

372
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:42.702
restrictions, going forward?

373
00:17:42.702 --> 00:17:45.327
It’s entirely possible.

374
00:17:45.327 --> 00:17:48.869
And that isn’t because it’s
something that I celebrate.

375
00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:51.577
I never came into politics
to intervene in the way people

376
00:17:51.577 --> 00:17:56.577
live their lives in this
sort of way.

377
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:01.452
But if we don’t do something then,
as I say, we’ll witness and we’ll

378
00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:04.577
stand by while people are coming
to harm, and we can’t do that.

379
00:18:04.577 --> 00:18:09.494
The responsibility of the government
is to care for the people we’re

380
00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:11.869
responsible for, the people
that we serve, and I’ve already

381
00:18:11.869 --> 00:18:14.994
indicated at the start of this week
that we’re looking at the potential

382
00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:16.036
for different national measures.

383
00:18:16.036 --> 00:18:18.661
And I always said —
as the First Minister did —

384
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.327
going into the firebreak,
we hope to get to the end

385
00:18:21.327 --> 00:18:24.161
of the year, but if case numbers
move in the wrong direction,

386
00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:25.827
we may have to do
something different.

387
00:18:25.827 --> 00:18:27.952
And it’s entirely possible
we’ll have to do that.

388
00:18:27.952 --> 00:18:30.661
The cabinet will meet again
during the day tomorrow and we’ll

389
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:31.827
have some decisions to make.

390
00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:33.994
All of those decisions
are how we take care

391
00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:36.827
of ourselves and each other,
and how we continue to keep safe.

392
00:18:36.827 --> 00:18:39.744
And in that, the reason we’ve been
able to have some success

393
00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.911
in with what we’ve done
with the firebreak is

394
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:44.077
because people have responded
to the measures we’ve taken

395
00:18:44.077 --> 00:18:45.244
and the leadership we’ve given.

396
00:18:45.244 --> 00:18:50.202
But we still need to do more to get
there, in this great national effort

397
00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:53.577
against a pandemic.

398
00:18:53.577 --> 00:18:55.494
In public health terms,
but also the economic...

399
00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:58.369
OK, I need to bring the rest
of the panel in, Vaughan.

400
00:18:58.369 --> 00:18:59.411
Thank you.

401
00:18:59.411 --> 00:19:00.452
Adam.

402
00:19:00.452 --> 00:19:02.827
Yes.

403
00:19:02.827 --> 00:19:05.202
And clearly, the Welsh Government
does have some difficult decisions

404
00:19:05.202 --> 00:19:06.911
to make in the next few days.

405
00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:09.077
And how do you think those
decisions should go?

406
00:19:09.077 --> 00:19:12.452
Well, look, I mean, the first thing,
I think none of this is easy.

407
00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:15.369
I think Claire is right
that there is a balance of harms

408
00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:17.536
always and risks here that has
to be considered.

409
00:19:17.536 --> 00:19:20.827
But clearly, the position that
you don’t want to be in is to see

410
00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:25.827
that exponential rise
in cases again.

411
00:19:27.577 --> 00:19:29.536
And particularly...

412
00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:34.536
The current restrictions,
it would seem,

413
00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:39.161
are not going to be enough to keep
that level, the prevalence

414
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:40.202
of the disease down.

415
00:19:40.202 --> 00:19:43.577
And then you’re in a very dangerous
position, where you could see a rise

416
00:19:43.577 --> 00:19:47.244
in cases leading to a rise
in hospitalisation throughout

417
00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:50.369
December, as we get to Christmas,
when you have the easing in order

418
00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:51.786
to allow people to get together.

419
00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:54.327
So, what’s your response
to Michael’s question?

420
00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:57.161
Should we alljust be as script
as possible and buckle down?

421
00:19:57.161 --> 00:19:58.202
Absolutely.

422
00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:01.077
I think the point that the audience
has made actually, in terms

423
00:20:01.077 --> 00:20:04.202
of the importance of trust,
the importance of clear

424
00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:05.869
communication, and underlining
the fact that governments

425
00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:06.911
have an important role.

426
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:11.911
There are certain things that
only governments can do

427
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:18.619
and the rules and the regulations,
the restrictions are part of that.

428
00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:21.911
But actually, we will only defeat
this virus if we all play our part.

429
00:20:21.911 --> 00:20:24.077
You know, that’s the real
truth of the situation.

430
00:20:24.077 --> 00:20:25.994
Lockdowns should only ever be
a last—resort option,

431
00:20:25.994 --> 00:20:29.244
when you have to do that
because of this exponential rise.

432
00:20:29.244 --> 00:20:32.077
The way we suppress the virus
is if we keep to those

433
00:20:32.077 --> 00:20:33.994
simple rules of avoiding,
wherever possible, you know,

434
00:20:33.994 --> 00:20:36.702
close contact in crowded situations.

435
00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.161
So, we all have a
contribution to make.

436
00:20:39.161 --> 00:20:41.577
Clearly, the Government
is going to have to make some

437
00:20:41.577 --> 00:20:45.869
difficult decisions.

438
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:50.827
The one plea is, if they are looking
at introducing similar Tier 3—like

439
00:20:56.369 --> 00:20:58.744
restrictions in hospitality, we have
to provide the economic support.

440
00:20:58.744 --> 00:21:01.452
So we’ve got to align health policy
with the economic policy,

441
00:21:01.452 --> 00:21:03.827
so if we’re closing businesses,
I would like to see

442
00:21:03.827 --> 00:21:06.452
the Welsh Government providing
a higher level of support to those

443
00:21:06.452 --> 00:21:08.119
businesses to help them
effectively to hibernate.

444
00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:09.619
To survive through this
difficult period.

445
00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:12.452
You know, there is some light
at the end of the tunnel,

446
00:21:12.452 --> 00:21:15.077
we are going to get through this,
but let’s save lives

447
00:21:15.077 --> 00:21:16.161
and save livelihoods.

448
00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:18.994
So let’s make sure that we have
the health and the economic

449
00:21:18.994 --> 00:21:21.161
policy working in tandem,
and that goes for the

450
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.202
self—employed as well.

451
00:21:22.202 --> 00:21:24.869
The self—employed have been badly
let down by the UK Government.

452
00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:27.494
So I’d like to see the Welsh
Government going one better

453
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:29.869
and helping those people that have
fallen between the cracks.

454
00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:32.744
I need to bring the audience
in as well, who are sitting

455
00:21:32.744 --> 00:21:33.744
here very patiently.

456
00:21:33.744 --> 00:21:35.119
Hannah.

457
00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:38.244
Ijust wanted to say that I agree
with the point I think

458
00:21:38.244 --> 00:21:40.661
it was Michael made about,
is it worth itjust

459
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:42.077
for a few days at Christmas?

460
00:21:42.077 --> 00:21:44.744
You know, we’re talking about cases
rising, it looks like cases

461
00:21:44.744 --> 00:21:49.702
are going to rise through December
and, yet, the green light’s

462
00:21:55.077 --> 00:21:57.202
been
given to people to meet at Christmas

463
00:21:57.202 --> 00:22:01.119
time,
regardless of where

464
00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:02.536
we are at at this point.

465
00:22:02.536 --> 00:22:03.786
Is it really worth it?

466
00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:06.869
A lot of us don’t want to,
yet we’re all going to pay

467
00:22:06.869 --> 00:22:08.036
for it in either way.

468
00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.077
0K, Rachel.

469
00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:10.161
Hi.

470
00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:13.077
I just feel that the devolved
governments have done so much better

471
00:22:13.077 --> 00:22:15.452
a job of passing the messages
on than the Westminster

472
00:22:15.452 --> 00:22:16.494
Government has done.

473
00:22:16.494 --> 00:22:18.869
I think it’s been quite a learning
opportunity for Westminster,

474
00:22:18.869 --> 00:22:21.577
if only they would actually pay
attention to what the devolved

475
00:22:21.577 --> 00:22:22.577
governments are doing.

476
00:22:22.577 --> 00:22:23.619
Peter.

477
00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:26.244
I think it’s important
that we as a country all work

478
00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:28.411
together to reduce the risk
to the most vulnerable.

479
00:22:28.411 --> 00:22:31.286
And if that means that we have
to forego time at Christmas

480
00:22:31.286 --> 00:22:34.161
with the ones that we love,
then I think that is something

481
00:22:34.161 --> 00:22:36.327
that we should all do
for the greater good.

482
00:22:36.327 --> 00:22:37.369
0K.

483
00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:40.411
Briefly, Claire, yes.

484
00:22:40.411 --> 00:22:43.244
Yeah, I think we all want to protect
the vulnerable, but one

485
00:22:43.244 --> 00:22:46.369
of the problems with a lot
of the lockdown measures —

486
00:22:46.369 --> 00:22:49.411
and that includes tiering systems —
is the very people who are being

487
00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:50.452
neglected are the vulnerable.

488
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.619
I mean, you can’t visit
people in care homes.

489
00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:54.161
They are lonely.

490
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:57.661
Mrs Smith, in number 16,
can’t get any visitors.

491
00:22:57.661 --> 00:23:00.661
People with dementia in care homes
are dying because they’re

492
00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:03.827
not being stimulated,
they’ve got no attention.

493
00:23:03.827 --> 00:23:05.994
The vulnerable are actually
being neglected by our attempts

494
00:23:05.994 --> 00:23:10.994
at protecting the vulnerable.

495
00:23:11.202 --> 00:23:13.786
You can visit care homes in Wales,
it’s worth pointing out,

496
00:23:13.786 --> 00:23:15.536
given there are already
exceptions in Swansea.

497
00:23:15.536 --> 00:23:18.119
Yes, yes, but it’s also the case
that there’s been massive

498
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.036
restrictions on visits in care
homes in Wales.

499
00:23:20.036 --> 00:23:25.077
I’m from Wales and know
people in care homes.

500
00:23:27.952 --> 00:23:29.869
The misery, the terror,
the horror, the loneliness.

501
00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:31.369
We’re making it sound as though...

502
00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:33.952
And then people have said, well,
don’t let’s have Christmas, then.

503
00:23:33.952 --> 00:23:35.869
I think people don’t
have to have Christmas

504
00:23:35.869 --> 00:23:37.619
if you don’t want to, feel free.

505
00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:40.952
I think that we have to consider
what it is we consider to be

506
00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:44.036
important about what it means to be
alive, how we relate to people,

507
00:23:44.036 --> 00:23:47.911
what our relationships
are like with people.

508
00:23:47.911 --> 00:23:50.994
And I think thatjust seeing it
through Covid eyes only means

509
00:23:50.994 --> 00:23:54.744
that we neglect the hugely important
social aspects of protecting people,

510
00:23:54.744 --> 00:23:59.036
of sociability, civility.

511
00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:01.452
Young people are having their lives
thwarted and, you know,

512
00:24:01.452 --> 00:24:04.369
people kind of talk about them
going out and wanting to go

513
00:24:04.369 --> 00:24:07.702
and have a drink as if it’s the most
irresponsible thing in the world,

514
00:24:07.702 --> 00:24:09.661
and then we infantilise
people in the process,

515
00:24:09.661 --> 00:24:11.411
because we don’t trust them.

516
00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:16.411
So when people say about trust,
you can’t have trust if you then

517
00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:25.744
say, "But if you break the rules,
you’ll be fined and you’ll be

518
00:24:25.744 --> 00:24:26.786
accused of killing Granny."

519
00:24:26.786 --> 00:24:28.994
You’ve got to actually trust
people, and that requires

520
00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:30.202
a different approach to this.

521
00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:32.119
And I think it would
actually be beneficial

522
00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:34.119
to the vulnerable to adopt that.

523
00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:35.786
Very quickly because,
otherwise, I can’t move

524
00:24:35.786 --> 00:24:36.994
on to the next question.

525
00:24:36.994 --> 00:24:40.077
We’re piloting schemes in 20 care
homes of how we can get two

526
00:24:40.077 --> 00:24:41.119
visits in through testing.

527
00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:43.952
And of course, the weekly testing
of care staff and the monthly

528
00:24:43.952 --> 00:24:45.036
testing of residents.

529
00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:48.411
And I have to give a shout—out —
I’m a patron of a charity

530
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:53.411
called Kissing it Better,
which gets young people

531
00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:56.744
to go to care homes
through the Covid crisis,

532
00:24:56.744 --> 00:24:58.952
and before, to perform,
to sing outside, and has

533
00:24:58.952 --> 00:24:59.994
made a huge difference.

534
00:24:59.994 --> 00:25:02.411
Something makes me think we’ll be
talking about Christmas restrictions

535
00:25:02.411 --> 00:25:05.036
for however many days there are left
of Christmas, I don’t

536
00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:06.286
know, but I know it’s
coming up very quickly.

537
00:25:07.827 --> 00:25:11.202
But before I do, Ijust want to say
that we’re looking for people

538
00:25:11.202 --> 00:25:13.369
to join our virtual audience
for next week’s programme.

539
00:25:13.369 --> 00:25:14.411
That is in Bath.

540
00:25:14.411 --> 00:25:15.827
And the week after that, Chelmsford.

541
00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:18.244
Obviously, we can’t come
to you, but you can come

542
00:25:18.244 --> 00:25:20.452
to us from the comfort
of your living room.

543
00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:23.744
So, if you live in or around Bath
or Chelmsford, do get in touch

544
00:25:23.744 --> 00:25:24.619
on the Question Time website.

545
00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:24.952
on the Question Time website.

546
00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:26.661
Come and be part of the programme.

547
00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:31.119
You are what makes Question Time
what it is, so dojoin in.

548
00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:33.994
Right, let’s take our next question
now, which is from Janette Williams.

549
00:25:33.994 --> 00:25:39.036
Thanks, Fiona.

550
00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:43.036
The economic effect caused
by Covid—19 will be felt for years.

551
00:25:43.036 --> 00:25:44.952
Should public—sector workers expect
pay rises whilst thousands

552
00:25:44.952 --> 00:25:46.869
from the private sector
are faced with unemployment?

553
00:25:46.869 --> 00:25:51.827
Vaughan.

554
00:25:54.369 --> 00:25:56.744
I think public—sector workers do
deserve a fair pay rise.

555
00:25:56.744 --> 00:25:58.702
People have been on streets
applauding for them

556
00:25:58.702 --> 00:25:59.702
in the first wave.

557
00:25:59.702 --> 00:26:04.702
We’re now told that the Government,
the UK Government, will fund

558
00:26:06.702 --> 00:26:08.869
a health—service pay rise, but not
other public—service workers.

559
00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:11.286
And yet, we have environmental
health officers from the local

560
00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:13.702
government who have been a key part
of our response.

561
00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:16.786
We have all the staff who have
worked to keep our schools open.

562
00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:19.202
All those other local workers,
police officers and the Army.

563
00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:22.077
The Army are a key part
of the response to the mass

564
00:26:22.077 --> 00:26:23.119
testing in Merthyr Tydfil.

565
00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:25.994
And yet, they’re being told
that they don’t deserve a pay rise.

566
00:26:25.994 --> 00:26:28.452
And actually, suppressing pay
in our public sector will actually

567
00:26:28.452 --> 00:26:31.536
mean there are less people
who will be able to go and spend

568
00:26:31.536 --> 00:26:34.161
in the local economy as well,
so I don’t think it’s

569
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.202
the right choice.

570
00:26:35.202 --> 00:26:38.327
I think it’s a real kick
in the teeth for so many people

571
00:26:38.327 --> 00:26:40.994
who kept the country going,
and we’re still going to rely

572
00:26:40.994 --> 00:26:43.161
on those people through a very,
very difficult winter.

573
00:26:43.161 --> 00:26:45.744
I think the Chancellor should take
the opportunity to think again

574
00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:48.661
because it sends out a message
about how much we value people

575
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:51.744
who have given up so much —
and, in some cases, everything —

576
00:26:51.744 --> 00:26:53.244
to keep all of us safe.

577
00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:56.911
Janette, you asked the question,
what’s your view?

578
00:26:56.911 --> 00:27:01.952
I’ve worked in the public sector
most of my employment.

579
00:27:02.577 --> 00:27:06.452
I think the nurses, the police,
I’d want to give, there’s so many

580
00:27:06.452 --> 00:27:08.661
people have contributed to,
you know, immensely

581
00:27:08.661 --> 00:27:13.702
to the cause with Covid.

582
00:27:14.286 --> 00:27:16.702
But we haven’t got the money,
you know, the money’s

583
00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:21.702
not going to be there.

584
00:27:21.911 --> 00:27:24.744
How do you solve it,
do we need to just take stock?

585
00:27:24.744 --> 00:27:26.661
Fantastic that the NHS
has got the money.

586
00:27:26.661 --> 00:27:28.827
However, I don’t know.

587
00:27:28.827 --> 00:27:30.744
I really don’t know,
it’s a huge one.

588
00:27:30.744 --> 00:27:33.452
Claire.

589
00:27:33.452 --> 00:27:38.494
I think it’s really wrong, Vaughan,
to talk about this decision

590
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:41.327
as being about anyone
saying that no—one...

591
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:44.286
You said, no—one is being told...

592
00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:47.411
You said, people are being told
that they don’t deserve a pay rise.

593
00:27:47.411 --> 00:27:49.869
I don’t think anyone is saying that.

594
00:27:49.869 --> 00:27:54.911
I think actually, it is incredibly
divisive at the moment to try

595
00:27:55.244 --> 00:28:00.036
and imply that public—sector workers
not getting a pay rise at this time

596
00:28:00.036 --> 00:28:02.411
is because, you know,
there’s always the danger of evil

597
00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:05.202
Tories hate the public sector.

598
00:28:05.202 --> 00:28:09.619
But let’s consider what,
for example, your firebreak lockdown

599
00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:13.161
did in Wales to the people who run
nail bars, to the hairdressers,

600
00:28:13.161 --> 00:28:16.202
to the people whose life savings
have been absolutely destroyed,

601
00:28:16.202 --> 00:28:18.827
who face bankruptcy, who potentially
are going to lose their homes.

602
00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:22.286
These people...

603
00:28:22.286 --> 00:28:25.786
I mean, nobody deserved to be told
that they couldn’t make a living

604
00:28:25.786 --> 00:28:30.827
but, as people keep reminding me,
there’s a pandemic,

605
00:28:36.661 --> 00:28:38.536
and the Government brought
in certain things and

606
00:28:38.536 --> 00:28:41.869
furlough isn’t sufficient.

607
00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:44.536
You know, and many public—sector
workers are actually in a stronger

608
00:28:44.536 --> 00:28:46.702
decision at the moment,
in terms ofjob security,

609
00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:48.119
than people in the private sector.

610
00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:51.036
You know, the private sector is full
of people who actually also

611
00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:53.202
were the invisible front
line that kept us going,

612
00:28:53.202 --> 00:28:56.286
the people who dropped off to those
people who enjoy working from home,

613
00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:58.202
who dropped off the Amazon,
the Deliveroo drivers.

614
00:28:58.202 --> 00:28:59.869
All of these people
deserve pay rises.

615
00:28:59.869 --> 00:29:02.869
We all deserve pay rises.

616
00:29:02.869 --> 00:29:05.036
But what I’d say is,
that misses the point.

617
00:29:05.036 --> 00:29:07.994
And you cannot be in a situation,
and I can’t understand why

618
00:29:07.994 --> 00:29:09.952
the Labour Party haven’t worked
this bit out.

619
00:29:09.952 --> 00:29:12.369
The Labour Party have been calling
forstronger, harder, longer,

620
00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:17.411
deeper lockdowns since the beginning
of this thing.

621
00:29:19.536 --> 00:29:22.661
They want to close the economy down
and then seem to be shocked

622
00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:27.661
that there is an economic crisis
that’s going to be the greatest

623
00:29:28.286 --> 00:29:31.452
facing for notjust decades,
but for centuries.

624
00:29:31.452 --> 00:29:35.994
So, we’ve got a major problem.

625
00:29:35.994 --> 00:29:40.452
At some point, somebody’s
got to create...

626
00:29:40.452 --> 00:29:42.077
We’ve got to have development,
economic prosperity,

627
00:29:42.077 --> 00:29:43.994
industrialisation, to create
the facilities that allow public

628
00:29:43.994 --> 00:29:46.161
sector, not the facilities,
that allow the public sector

629
00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:48.994
to exist in the first place.

630
00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:53.577
To highlight public sector
as though they’re the only

631
00:29:53.577 --> 00:29:55.702
heroes of this pandemic,
I completely salute care workers

632
00:29:55.702 --> 00:29:57.994
and all the rest of it.

633
00:29:57.994 --> 00:30:00.786
I salute the public sector
workers who worked.

634
00:30:00.786 --> 00:30:02.077
But my goodness,

635
00:30:02.077 --> 00:30:04.702
the people who didn’t work weren’t
just lazing around doing nothing,

636
00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:06.661
working for the private
sector, getting well paid.

637
00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:08.036
They’re being absolutely
treated with contempt

638
00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:09.952
and have been forgotten and,
therefore, don’t be

639
00:30:09.952 --> 00:30:10.994
divisive about it.

640
00:30:10.994 --> 00:30:12.077
Jared.

641
00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:13.119
0h, Vaughan.

642
00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:18.077
0K, quickly, sorry.

643
00:30:21.952 --> 00:30:25.119
We’ve got the best support of any UK
nation to support the private

644
00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:26.119
sector through the pandemic.

645
00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:28.702
We have put our money
where our mouth is in supporting

646
00:30:28.702 --> 00:30:29.786
public sector workers.

647
00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:32.661
We’ve also put significant financial
support over and above what the UK

648
00:30:32.661 --> 00:30:34.369
Government has provided
to our private sector.

649
00:30:34.369 --> 00:30:37.452
The idea that we despise the private
sector is just simply not true.

650
00:30:37.452 --> 00:30:40.119
It’s a strawman, not a serious
answer to the really serious

651
00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:41.577
questions we face as a country.

652
00:30:41.577 --> 00:30:44.661
This really is a fight for lives
and livelihoods, and that has always

653
00:30:44.661 --> 00:30:46.119
driven our approach here in Wales.

654
00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:47.577
Tanni.

655
00:30:47.577 --> 00:30:50.702
Most of my close family work
in the front line of the public

656
00:30:50.702 --> 00:30:52.661
sector so my heart says,
yes, absolutely, people

657
00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:54.286
need to feel valued.

658
00:30:54.286 --> 00:30:57.661
And one of my best friends
is a nurse and I said to her,

659
00:30:57.661 --> 00:31:00.744
actually, can you explain the last
three or four pay rises to me?

660
00:31:00.744 --> 00:31:02.911
And actually, you almost need
a degree in economics

661
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:05.577
to work it out because,
half the time, it’s a pay

662
00:31:05.577 --> 00:31:10.619
freeze and over ten years,
rather than actually something that

663
00:31:17.661 --> 00:31:18.661
is a pay rise.

664
00:31:18.661 --> 00:31:19.869
So my heart says, yes.

665
00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:22.702
However, if you look at the figures
of where we are now,

666
00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:25.161
this is twice as bad
as the crisis in 2008.

667
00:31:25.161 --> 00:31:28.036
This is the most amount of money
the British Government has had

668
00:31:28.036 --> 00:31:29.702
to borrow since the Second World
War.

669
00:31:29.702 --> 00:31:32.369
And we have to think
about how we pay that back,

670
00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:34.702
because we have to pay it back
at some time.

671
00:31:34.702 --> 00:31:37.411
So, for me, it’s thinking
about how we can be more

672
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:38.452
creative with the economy.

673
00:31:38.452 --> 00:31:40.827
You know, we know four
out of five pubs —

674
00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:43.952
if they’re in Tier 2 and Tier 3 —
won’t open, going forward,

675
00:31:43.952 --> 00:31:45.119
will choose not to open.

676
00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:48.286
And thatjust keeps having a big
effect on all the different economy.

677
00:31:48.286 --> 00:31:51.369
But for me, you know,
I do a lot of work in physical

678
00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:53.577
activity and that sector,
and it’s thinking about how

679
00:31:53.577 --> 00:31:56.202
we can change the value,
how we can bring different sectors

680
00:31:56.202 --> 00:31:57.369
together to boost the economy.

681
00:31:57.369 --> 00:32:00.286
And we have to be really creative,
in a way that we’ve

682
00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:01.661
never had to do before.

683
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:04.119
You know, we talk aboutjoining up
government, you know,

684
00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:05.994
that never quite works
because the legislation work

685
00:32:05.994 --> 00:32:07.452
is always in specific subject areas.

686
00:32:07.452 --> 00:32:14.327
But I think we have
to be more creative.

687
00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:18.494
have got so much sympathy for
businesses that are yo—yoing in and

688
00:32:18.494 --> 00:32:20.161
out and don’t know what to do.

689
00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:22.077
I worked on the Welfare
Reform Bill in

690
00:32:22.077 --> 00:32:25.244
2012 and legal aid punishment fans
and we thought that was brutal and

691
00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:28.786
it is much worse now and we have
also got to think about the people

692
00:32:28.786 --> 00:32:30.494
on Universal Credit,
that is pushing them

693
00:32:30.494 --> 00:32:31.536
into even greater poverty.

694
00:32:31.536 --> 00:32:33.661
We have got to think
about how we can

695
00:32:33.661 --> 00:32:35.786
protect the most vulnerable
that we have in society.

696
00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:37.536
There are no easy answers to this.

697
00:32:37.536 --> 00:32:39.952
I mean, it is really
easy for me as a

698
00:32:39.952 --> 00:32:41.619
parliamentarian to sit
and tell the government

699
00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:43.036
what I think they should do.

700
00:32:43.036 --> 00:32:44.702
We have all got
opinions on everything.

701
00:32:44.702 --> 00:32:47.619
I don’t think I would want to be
the Chancellor right now.

702
00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:51.202
He is in an unenviable position in
terms of what they are trying to do.

703
00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:53.369
We have to find a way out of this.

704
00:32:53.369 --> 00:32:55.536
Let’s hear what our
audience have got to say.

705
00:32:55.536 --> 00:33:00.536
Kane.

706
00:33:00.869 --> 00:33:02.994
Yeah, Ijust wanted
to bring in the voluntary

707
00:33:02.994 --> 00:33:04.036
on the third sector.

708
00:33:04.036 --> 00:33:05.702
I work in a third
sector organisation

709
00:33:05.702 --> 00:33:08.786
and I think across the board
in Wales, the sector have done an

710
00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:11.702
incredible job in terms of working
with the most vulnerable in society

711
00:33:11.702 --> 00:33:12.744
over the pandemic period.

712
00:33:12.744 --> 00:33:14.452
When we are discussing
public services and

713
00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:19.494
pay rises, and private
versus public sector,

714
00:33:20.202 --> 00:33:23.577
I think the voluntary sector often
goes missing in that debate.

715
00:33:23.577 --> 00:33:26.286
I also work with
people who are living

716
00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:31.286
directly, struggling
directly with poverty.

717
00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:34.161
A lot of parent carers who actually
are completely unpaid for

718
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:37.494
the work that they do,
so I think we need to be having this

719
00:33:37.494 --> 00:33:42.369
debate within a wider context,
bearing in mind

720
00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:45.452
that services, personal
assistance services,

721
00:33:45.452 --> 00:33:48.536
carers, have been unable
to undertake their normal duties and

722
00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:52.036
we have a lot of parents, women
especially, who have been left to

723
00:33:52.036 --> 00:33:56.536
take that role and they have had no
reward and no financial recompense

724
00:33:56.536 --> 00:33:59.327
for doing that whatsoever.

725
00:33:59.327 --> 00:34:02.661
Jack.

726
00:34:02.661 --> 00:34:04.994
Well, I would just
like to say that I agree

727
00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:05.994
completely with Claire
on

728
00:34:05.994 --> 00:34:07.077
this point.

729
00:34:07.077 --> 00:34:09.702
At this stage of the pandemic,
speaking of pay rises is

730
00:34:09.702 --> 00:34:14.744
completely unwarranted, really.

731
00:34:19.452 --> 00:34:21.619
It only serves to
split us apart when

732
00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:24.661
at this point we should stand
together and in addition to that,

733
00:34:24.661 --> 00:34:27.911
who gets to say who
should be paid what?

734
00:34:27.911 --> 00:34:32.911
How can you put a price on a life?

735
00:34:37.494 --> 00:34:38.911
Jared.

736
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:41.369
I completely agree with Claire’s
point and it is really

737
00:34:41.369 --> 00:34:43.994
refreshing to see somebody in the
mainstream media making this case

738
00:34:43.994 --> 00:34:48.994
for looking at the bigger picture,
rather than the knee jerk lockdown

739
00:34:53.577 --> 00:34:56.661
reactions that we have seen time
after time and there are much wider

740
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.036
implications as a
result of lockdown.

741
00:34:58.036 --> 00:35:00.911
We talked about the mental health
pandemic that is with us and

742
00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:03.327
is going to be with
us for some time.

743
00:35:03.327 --> 00:35:06.244
We have seen the economic damage
that has been caused as a

744
00:35:06.244 --> 00:35:08.077
result of these lockdown
actions and I think

745
00:35:08.077 --> 00:35:09.536
we really have to look
at

746
00:35:09.536 --> 00:35:12.536
the bigger picture once we make
these decisions and be ready from

747
00:35:12.536 --> 00:35:15.161
the range of impacts
that come from them.

748
00:35:15.161 --> 00:35:17.577
Adam, let mejust remind
you of the question.

749
00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:19.661
Should public sector
workers get pay rises while

750
00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:24.661
thousands from the private sector
are faced with unemployment?

751
00:35:26.536 --> 00:35:27.911
Well, I suppose
politics and economics

752
00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:29.577
really is about
priorities, isn’t it?

753
00:35:29.577 --> 00:35:32.411
I think it does say something
about the government that the first

754
00:35:32.411 --> 00:35:35.577
area they look at when they are
looking to make savings is, you

755
00:35:35.577 --> 00:35:40.452
know, public sector workers pay
and the global poor.

756
00:35:40.452 --> 00:35:43.244
And, by the way, we are talking
about a real terms cut,

757
00:35:43.244 --> 00:35:48.036
so let’s be clear about these
public sector workers.

758
00:35:48.036 --> 00:35:50.661
I think it is precisely
the wrong thing to say and

759
00:35:50.661 --> 00:35:55.661
do at this point, because we have
had 13 years effectively off

760
00:35:56.661 --> 00:35:59.827
austerity, we made this mistake last
time we had an economic crisis and

761
00:35:59.827 --> 00:36:01.702
in an economic crisis...

762
00:36:01.702 --> 00:36:06.036
This is a much larger
economic crisis.

763
00:36:06.036 --> 00:36:09.077
Well, in terms of
the situation that we

764
00:36:09.077 --> 00:36:14.119
are facing in unemployment, yes, but
there was an economist 100 years ago

765
00:36:21.286 --> 00:36:22.952
who wrote a pamphlet,
the consequences of

766
00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:23.994
the peace, John Maynard

767
00:36:23.994 --> 00:36:26.702
Keynes, and he said, when you’re
faced with an economic crisis,

768
00:36:26.702 --> 00:36:29.744
precisely the lies thing you should
do is to cutback on government

769
00:36:29.744 --> 00:36:30.786
spending.

770
00:36:30.786 --> 00:36:32.702
It sounds kind of implicitly
sensible, doesn’t it?

771
00:36:32.702 --> 00:36:34.661
We have got no money
because the economy

772
00:36:34.661 --> 00:36:35.827
is going down, therefore
we

773
00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:38.494
will spend less, but governments
have an absolute central role, which

774
00:36:38.494 --> 00:36:40.661
is unique in this circumstance,
they are the only

775
00:36:40.661 --> 00:36:41.827
ones, when you’re in
a

776
00:36:41.827 --> 00:36:43.994
deflationary spiral,
it is only governments that can keep

777
00:36:43.994 --> 00:36:45.786
actually the economy going and then
that

778
00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:49.494
works, by the way, for private
sector workers and public sector

779
00:36:49.494 --> 00:36:51.661
workers.

780
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:54.577
It is the mistake we made last time,
after the last economic

781
00:36:54.577 --> 00:36:57.244
crisis, we went into austerity,
which is why wages have stagnated,

782
00:36:57.244 --> 00:36:59.369
in the public sector in particular.

783
00:36:59.369 --> 00:37:00.869
What does that mean as well?

784
00:37:00.869 --> 00:37:02.744
We find it difficult
to recruit nurses,

785
00:37:02.744 --> 00:37:07.702
social care workers, teachers etc,
all the public services that we have

786
00:37:07.994 --> 00:37:11.202
realised in this pandemic that
are absolutely critical in being the

787
00:37:11.202 --> 00:37:14.994
decent society that we want to be
and are we saying, after all that,

788
00:37:14.994 --> 00:37:19.994
the first place we are going to cut
is the pay of public sector workers?

789
00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:27.369
These are not the values that
I would like to see from our

790
00:37:27.369 --> 00:37:28.452
government.

791
00:37:28.452 --> 00:37:30.286
Nadhim.

792
00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:31.494
Thank you.

793
00:37:31.494 --> 00:37:33.161
And, Janette, thank
you for the question

794
00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:34.202
and it is actually...

795
00:37:34.202 --> 00:37:36.869
That is not true what you
have just heard, so as

796
00:37:36.869 --> 00:37:41.702
far as nurses and doctors,
there will be a pay rise,

797
00:37:41.702 --> 00:37:44.452
as well as for 2.1 million public
sector workers

798
00:37:44.452 --> 00:37:48.661
who are on £24,000 or
less a £250 pay rise.

799
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:51.911
That is likely to be
less than inflation.

800
00:37:51.911 --> 00:37:55.244
So that is a pay cut.

801
00:37:55.244 --> 00:37:57.411
It is still £250 additional,
in a difficult time,

802
00:37:57.411 --> 00:37:59.119
which we have been discussing.

803
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:02.202
If you take a look at inflation,
it is not a pay rise.

804
00:38:02.202 --> 00:38:03.869
Let me make my point forJanette.

805
00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:06.619
For the private sector,
and to the point

806
00:38:06.619 --> 00:38:08.994
that there are about, you’re
absolutely right, Claire, one should

807
00:38:08.994 --> 00:38:10.452
not be divisive about these things.

808
00:38:10.452 --> 00:38:13.327
The national living
wage will rise to £8

809
00:38:13.327 --> 00:38:15.327
91, to support workers
in the

810
00:38:15.327 --> 00:38:18.661
private sector, in the third sector
as well, but how do you create more

811
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:21.661
prosperity?

812
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:23.827
This is what the Chancellor
has tried to do.

813
00:38:23.827 --> 00:38:25.994
If you look at what
he published with the

814
00:38:25.994 --> 00:38:30.911
statement, which is the national
infrastructure strategy for next

815
00:38:30.911 --> 00:38:33.827
year, £100 billion of spending over
five years, 600 billion, what does

816
00:38:33.827 --> 00:38:34.869
that mean?

817
00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:36.827
What does that mean
to you in Swansea?

818
00:38:36.827 --> 00:38:39.661
Well, what it means is that
in Swansea, as part of the

819
00:38:39.661 --> 00:38:42.577
city deal, there will be £150
million invested in Swansea, in part

820
00:38:42.577 --> 00:38:46.994
of that city deal, to create that
prosperity, to create the economic

821
00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:52.036
recovery that Claire talks about.

822
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:00.202
50 two thirds of a trillion
over five years

823
00:39:00.202 --> 00:39:02.536
of investment in infrastructure
in our schools, hospitals, our rail,

824
00:39:02.536 --> 00:39:03.577
our digital infrastructure.

825
00:39:03.577 --> 00:39:06.244
Hang on, I think we have
got a bit off the

826
00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:07.202
question here, haven’t we?

827
00:39:07.202 --> 00:39:08.702
Should public sector
workers expect pay

828
00:39:08.702 --> 00:39:11.286
rises, when thousands in the private
sector are faced with unemployment?

829
00:39:11.286 --> 00:39:14.452
If the question went round, Fiona,
and it went from talking about pay

830
00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:17.786
rises in a difficult time of Corona,
yes of course, we are making sure

831
00:39:17.786 --> 00:39:20.161
that nurses and doctors
get the pay rises, that

832
00:39:20.161 --> 00:39:21.369
public sector workers
on

833
00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:22.911
£24,000 or less get £250.

834
00:39:22.911 --> 00:39:24.911
It is a little bit awkward...

835
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:28.577
MPs may be getting
a pay rise of 4.1%.

836
00:39:28.577 --> 00:39:29.577
That’s wrong.

837
00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:32.702
I have been on record and said that
already and if it does

838
00:39:32.702 --> 00:39:36.077
happen, I hope that IPSA changes
that and I hope that the treat MPs

839
00:39:36.077 --> 00:39:39.452
in the same way that we are asking
the public sector to contribute to

840
00:39:39.452 --> 00:39:43.577
the effort to get this
country back on its feet.

841
00:39:43.577 --> 00:39:45.161
It is wrong.

842
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:47.744
There are are a couple
of hands up, I want to

843
00:39:47.744 --> 00:39:49.286
takejust before I move on.

844
00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:51.952
Phil.

845
00:39:51.952 --> 00:39:54.661
The books need to be balanced
and there are difficult choices for

846
00:39:54.661 --> 00:39:58.286
politicians to make and I think
Tanni alluded to it as I am going to

847
00:39:58.286 --> 00:40:01.661
now, who would be a politician in
the situation with all the books to

848
00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:02.869
be balanced and everything else?

849
00:40:02.869 --> 00:40:05.702
Back to the question, should
the public sector worker have a pay

850
00:40:05.702 --> 00:40:08.744
freeze?

851
00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:11.411
The private sector have been hit
very hard, the public sector

852
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:14.661
have been hit very hard,
but the public sector workers

853
00:40:14.661 --> 00:40:19.244
have had their wages,
they have been paid, albeit

854
00:40:19.244 --> 00:40:23.244
perhaps not as much as they would
like and in our hearts, as Tanni

855
00:40:23.244 --> 00:40:27.202
said, they deserve more,
but can we afford it?

856
00:40:27.202 --> 00:40:29.744
My children, my grandchildren
and possibly my great

857
00:40:29.744 --> 00:40:31.536
grandchildren will have
to be paying for this

858
00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:34.161
for many, many years
to

859
00:40:34.161 --> 00:40:37.286
come and the policies that have
to be embraced have to balance the

860
00:40:37.286 --> 00:40:39.827
books.

861
00:40:39.827 --> 00:40:42.202
Perhaps the Chancellor should have
apologised before he made the

862
00:40:42.202 --> 00:40:45.286
statement, perhaps he should have
said in a different way, but I do

863
00:40:45.286 --> 00:40:48.411
feel that the public sector workers,
if they have been paid and they

864
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:51.911
continue to be able
to be paid, I think

865
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:53.577
they have had a fair deal
as

866
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:57.661
much as possible in this horrible
situation that we are in.

867
00:40:57.661 --> 00:40:59.536
Let us take another
question from Shireen

868
00:40:59.536 --> 00:41:04.494
Al—Salihi.

869
00:41:09.411 --> 00:41:11.786
Is it right to cut up
the foreign aid budget?

870
00:41:11.786 --> 00:41:14.161
Well, look, Nadhim,
we are going to come to you

871
00:41:14.161 --> 00:41:15.202
on this, obviously.

872
00:41:15.202 --> 00:41:17.827
It is one of the toughest
decisions we have had to

873
00:41:17.827 --> 00:41:20.286
make, Shireen, the Chancellor
explained at the dispatch box, as

874
00:41:20.286 --> 00:41:23.619
did the Foreign Secretary today,
that we will, as soon as we can, go

875
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:28.619
back to the 0.7% of
GNI on foreign aid.

876
00:41:35.286 --> 00:41:38.869
By the way, even at 0.5%, we are
still only second of the G7 in

877
00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:40.077
terms of our development spending.

878
00:41:40.077 --> 00:41:41.786
I am very proud,
because my department

879
00:41:41.786 --> 00:41:43.494
was responsible for
the vaccines tax force,

880
00:41:43.494 --> 00:41:44.869
that we hosted the summit
in

881
00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:48.077
the UK which raised eight point 8
billion and we are contributing 330

882
00:41:48.077 --> 00:41:50.869
million a year to the Gavi vaccine
initiative to vaccinate the poorest

883
00:41:50.869 --> 00:41:55.869
children in the world.

884
00:41:57.536 --> 00:41:59.661
We continue to play
a leadership position in our

885
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:04.702
overseas development investment
and spending but also the 2A billion

886
00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:08.577
over the next four years
going into the Ministry of Defence

887
00:42:08.577 --> 00:42:13.577
and making sure that our ability
tojoin up

888
00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:18.661
both our overseas
development and what

889
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:21.244
we ran do for the rest
of the

890
00:42:21.244 --> 00:42:26.286
world in terms of peacekeeping
and every other part of the Foreign

891
00:42:28.994 --> 00:42:33.952
Office work in terms
of the combination of Foreign Office

892
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:38.952
leadership and development
leadership is something we should

893
00:42:38.952 --> 00:42:43.994
all be proud of and I hope that
as soon as we can and does fill was

894
00:42:47.327 --> 00:42:49.994
just saying balance the books
and get back to the 0.7%.

895
00:42:49.994 --> 00:42:53.202
Adam.

896
00:42:53.202 --> 00:42:55.577
I think it is a very
very sad move by

897
00:42:55.577 --> 00:42:58.494
the government and I think
particularly at this time when

898
00:42:58.494 --> 00:43:03.494
developing countries are also
struggling with this pandemic and

899
00:43:03.744 --> 00:43:06.202
all of the harms that
flow from that and,

900
00:43:06.202 --> 00:43:08.327
you know, lam stmck
by the

901
00:43:08.327 --> 00:43:12.911
contrast between the incoming Biden
administration and thank God the

902
00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:15.577
political weather is changing there
and they are talking about America

903
00:43:15.577 --> 00:43:18.661
showing global leadership, being
a progressive force in the world

904
00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:22.744
again.

905
00:43:22.744 --> 00:43:24.911
Rejoining the WHO, supporting
the climate change agreement and

906
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:27.869
doing more...

907
00:43:27.869 --> 00:43:29.702
They don’t spend as much on aid.

908
00:43:29.702 --> 00:43:32.077
They are talking about going
on the other direction,

909
00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:34.244
because they realise
that America as one

910
00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.827
of the richest countries
in the

911
00:43:35.827 --> 00:43:39.161
world has a responsibility and I
think I would like us to be doing

912
00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:42.411
"I’M-F

913
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:45.536
The Scandinavian countries aim
for 1% of GDP which was the original

914
00:43:45.536 --> 00:43:48.786
target from the UN and to
be going on the other

915
00:43:48.786 --> 00:43:50.286
direction I think it
is

916
00:43:50.286 --> 00:43:55.244
a sad indictment of the values
of this government once again.

917
00:43:56.827 --> 00:43:59.036
It is a percentage
figure after all and I

918
00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:01.952
think it is absolutely
important that we say,

919
00:44:01.952 --> 00:44:05.869
even at this difficult time,
because it is globally a

920
00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:07.994
difficult time, we do
have a responsibility,

921
00:44:07.994 --> 00:44:10.661
we are citizens of the world
and we have to demonstrate

922
00:44:10.661 --> 00:44:14.827
that in the kind of
decisions that we make.

923
00:44:14.827 --> 00:44:18.411
Shireen.

924
00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:21.036
Given that the defence budget has
increased, that we can always

925
00:44:21.036 --> 00:44:23.536
pull billions out of the bag
for war, for killing,

926
00:44:23.536 --> 00:44:25.911
for the renewal of Trident,
wouldn’t that money now be

927
00:44:25.911 --> 00:44:29.327
better spent on giving our nurses
3 well earned pay rise?

928
00:44:29.327 --> 00:44:32.036
I think we should put
welfare before warfare

929
00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:35.452
and I think we should put people
before profit and if we stop selling

930
00:44:35.452 --> 00:44:37.119
arms to Saudi, countries
like Yemen wouldn’t

931
00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:42.119
need our foreign aid
and

932
00:44:45.411 --> 00:44:47.286
millions of civilians there,
their suffering would ease.

933
00:44:47.286 --> 00:44:49.494
Shireen, we are giving
nurses 3 pay rise, but...

934
00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:52.119
Very briefly, because I want
to bring the audience in.

935
00:44:52.119 --> 00:44:53.577
The peacekeeping work
around the world

936
00:44:53.577 --> 00:44:55.036
is important.

937
00:44:55.036 --> 00:44:56.744
You have made that point, thank you.

938
00:44:56.744 --> 00:44:59.827
Let us hear what our
audience have to say.

939
00:44:59.827 --> 00:45:04.244
Yeah, the UK’s reputation
as a global player

940
00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:08.327
would be threatened just as it takes
on the chairmanship of the G7 summit

941
00:45:08.327 --> 00:45:11.036
and hosts the UN climate
change conference next

942
00:45:11.036 --> 00:45:15.411
year by investing
in

943
00:45:15.411 --> 00:45:18.911
these developing nations, the UK
would help to develop these emerging

944
00:45:18.911 --> 00:45:21.661
markets and that investment would
allow us to rate financial rewards,

945
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:26.619
having close trading
links with those nations.

946
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:31.911
Also on the cusp of having
a vaccine that will only be

947
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:34.744
effective if we are able
to distribute worldwide and have an

948
00:45:34.744 --> 00:45:37.327
effective programme
worldwide will we be

949
00:45:37.327 --> 00:45:39.077
able to get on top of
this

950
00:45:39.077 --> 00:45:42.411
pandemic.

951
00:45:42.411 --> 00:45:45.911
Stewart.

952
00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:50.744
We are now contributing
about £20 billion a

953
00:45:50.744 --> 00:45:55.744
year as aid and that would be
reduced to about {13.5 billion.

954
00:45:59.494 --> 00:46:01.661
We would still be
in the top three or

955
00:46:01.661 --> 00:46:06.244
four contributors
throughout the world.

956
00:46:06.244 --> 00:46:08.786
I think, Stewart, just to correct
you, we would actually be

957
00:46:08.786 --> 00:46:11.911
giving less than that, but we would
be the second largest giver of

958
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:13.119
foreign aid in the G7.

959
00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:15.869
But do go on, make your point.

960
00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:19.661
Sorry, I stand corrected,
but I think in view of

961
00:46:19.661 --> 00:46:21.577
what we said earlier
about public sector pay

962
00:46:21.577 --> 00:46:23.286
and everybody who has
to

963
00:46:23.286 --> 00:46:26.577
align themselves, I think we should
consider that this is a sensible

964
00:46:26.577 --> 00:46:31.327
move to make.

965
00:46:31.327 --> 00:46:35.952
It can be reverted when
circumstances improve and I do

966
00:46:35.952 --> 00:46:39.911
believe that a large percentage
of the population of this country do

967
00:46:39.911 --> 00:46:43.077
believe that we actually contribute
more than our fair share anyway.

968
00:46:48.161 --> 00:46:53.161
Michael].

969
00:46:53.202 --> 00:46:57.369
Yeah, I understand to a certain
extent why we’ve had

970
00:46:57.369 --> 00:47:00.244
to reduce the number,
but I don’t, what I would

971
00:47:00.244 --> 00:47:05.286
like to see is, as this
is supposedly a short—term

972
00:47:10.702 --> 00:47:13.369
reduction, is actually a fixed date
as to when this number

973
00:47:13.369 --> 00:47:14.536
is to rise back again.

974
00:47:14.536 --> 00:47:15.619
And, Claire.

975
00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:18.702
I think I agree with most
of the comments that have been said,

976
00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:21.369
but to use an aeroplane analogy,
I think it is really

977
00:47:21.369 --> 00:47:23.744
important that we put our own
oxygen mask on first.

978
00:47:23.744 --> 00:47:26.661
And I think that we do need
to keep it in perspective.

979
00:47:26.661 --> 00:47:31.244
This is a cut and it’s
not permanent.

980
00:47:31.244 --> 00:47:33.327
And it is going to be reinstated.

981
00:47:33.327 --> 00:47:36.661
But I do agree with Michael, it’s
a case of, when will that happen?

982
00:47:36.661 --> 00:47:38.411
Tanni.

983
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:41.619
I think it’s one of those questions
that it’s very easy to give

984
00:47:41.619 --> 00:47:43.286
a definitive yes or no
without exploring

985
00:47:43.286 --> 00:47:45.577
everything behind it.

986
00:47:45.577 --> 00:47:49.077
And you know, as a nation,
I do think we have a responsibility

987
00:47:49.077 --> 00:47:52.661
to look to the rest of the world,
as we have a responsibility to look

988
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.452
after the most vulnerable
we have in our society.

989
00:47:56.452 --> 00:47:59.327
But it’s actually quite a political
term when you think about it.

990
00:47:59.327 --> 00:48:00.827
And it’s actually about politics.

991
00:48:00.827 --> 00:48:01.869
It’s about sub—politics.

992
00:48:01.869 --> 00:48:03.286
It’s about hard politics.

993
00:48:03.286 --> 00:48:04.452
It’s about influence.

994
00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:09.327
It is about peacekeeping.

995
00:48:09.327 --> 00:48:11.702
It’s about trying to encourage
different countries to support us

996
00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:13.536
in lots of different ways.

997
00:48:13.536 --> 00:48:16.911
And I’d like to kind of have a more
detailed conversation

998
00:48:16.911 --> 00:48:21.536
about what that aid means
in lots of different ways.

999
00:48:21.536 --> 00:48:24.869
I think we need to think about,
as everyone else has said,

1000
00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:28.286
how quickly we can get back
to where we are and where we spend

1001
00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:29.494
the money that we save.

1002
00:48:29.494 --> 00:48:31.411
Because we’ve all talked about how
difficult economically

1003
00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:33.119
we are at the moment.

1004
00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:37.827
The other thing is,
as far as I understand it,

1005
00:48:37.827 --> 00:48:41.744
it’s got to be changed
by legislation and that has got

1006
00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:44.161
to go through both chambers,
the Commons and the Lords.

1007
00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:46.327
And that’s the chance
to interrogate every single part

1008
00:48:46.327 --> 00:48:48.494
of this and what the aid
means, going forward.

1009
00:48:48.494 --> 00:48:51.411
But I do think we have a
responsibility to help other people.

1010
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:56.369
Claire.

1011
00:48:56.452 --> 00:48:57.702
Ithink...

1012
00:48:57.702 --> 00:49:00.411
I really agree with Tanni,
a bit of the bigger picture

1013
00:49:00.411 --> 00:49:01.577
and a bit more complicated.

1014
00:49:01.577 --> 00:49:05.161
I think the idea that this cut means
that you don’t care about the global

1015
00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:07.827
poor is a misunderstanding.

1016
00:49:07.827 --> 00:49:10.661
And I’m not defending the Tories’
cut because I actually have got

1017
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:15.661
a bigger question about aid anyway,
and I always thought

1018
00:49:17.077 --> 00:49:19.494
that their legislation
to have the 0.7% had an element

1019
00:49:19.494 --> 00:49:24.494
of kind of moral grandstanding that
I found distasteful.

1020
00:49:26.452 --> 00:49:29.577
Because I think that the way that
you’re a global leader is not...

1021
00:49:29.577 --> 00:49:32.661
and I think it lacks imagination
that we think it’s only through aid.

1022
00:49:32.661 --> 00:49:35.577
I mean, we need to have, and be
encouraging countries to develop.

1023
00:49:35.577 --> 00:49:38.202
I’ll tell you what’s really hit
developing countries at the moment,

1024
00:49:38.202 --> 00:49:43.202
it’s not this decision to cut
the aid budget, but think

1025
00:49:44.036 --> 00:49:46.202
about the garment workers
in Bangladesh and the tourism

1026
00:49:46.202 --> 00:49:47.411
industry in those
developing countries.

1027
00:49:47.411 --> 00:49:52.327
That Western decision, in my
opinion, to have a disproportionate

1028
00:49:52.327 --> 00:49:56.827
reaction to coronavirus has
devastated their ability

1029
00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:59.286
to have their own industries,
their own autonomy and so

1030
00:49:59.286 --> 00:50:01.369
on and so forth.

1031
00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:03.744
So they’re suffering
as a consequence of actions we do

1032
00:50:03.744 --> 00:50:06.577
and you can’tjust say,
oh, well, aid would have compensated

1033
00:50:06.577 --> 00:50:07.744
for that, because it wouldn’t.

1034
00:50:07.744 --> 00:50:09.911
Their own governments are also
taking action against coronavirus.

1035
00:50:09.911 --> 00:50:11.119
Yes, but in different ways.

1036
00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:15.619
But I’m saying if you look actually
at all of the global reports,

1037
00:50:15.619 --> 00:50:18.119
they’ll say that the devastating
impact of the West’s

1038
00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:19.744
reaction of stopping
people travel and tourism,

1039
00:50:19.744 --> 00:50:23.327
as I say, but also the industries.

1040
00:50:23.327 --> 00:50:27.119
And if we really want to do
something, I think that we should

1041
00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:30.994
have no tariffs on, for example,
chocolate coming from Africa, parts

1042
00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.244
of Africa, in post—Brexit Britain.

1043
00:50:32.244 --> 00:50:35.286
There are all sorts of ways.

1044
00:50:35.286 --> 00:50:38.327
In other words, I believe in more
trade, not aid, if you want,

1045
00:50:38.327 --> 00:50:40.744
but encouraging development.

1046
00:50:40.744 --> 00:50:43.619
Rather than simply treating people
as though they are going to have

1047
00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:45.077
crumbs off the table of aid.

1048
00:50:45.077 --> 00:50:47.452
We have to remember as well,
it sounds very nice,

1049
00:50:47.452 --> 00:50:48.786
but aid is quite contentious.

1050
00:50:48.786 --> 00:50:51.452
It’s very political.

1051
00:50:51.452 --> 00:50:53.536
Aid NGOs are like a big
business, right?

1052
00:50:53.536 --> 00:50:58.494
They’re like multinationals,
a lot of them, they’re huge.

1053
00:50:58.952 --> 00:51:01.452
It’s not just straightforwardly
going to the global poor.

1054
00:51:01.452 --> 00:51:05.577
So I want to be able to query that,
to at least ask questions,

1055
00:51:05.577 --> 00:51:07.494
to have a complicated
and sophisticated conversation —

1056
00:51:07.494 --> 00:51:09.911
I’m not being funny about it —
without people thinking

1057
00:51:09.911 --> 00:51:12.327
you want to kill off
the global poor, because that

1058
00:51:12.327 --> 00:51:14.119
is actually not right.

1059
00:51:14.119 --> 00:51:17.286
And I think global Britain,
I do like the fact that there’s been

1060
00:51:17.286 --> 00:51:22.244
this attempt at saying that
vaccinations will be shared.

1061
00:51:23.577 --> 00:51:26.369
I thought one of the great things
about the Oxford AstraZeneca thing

1062
00:51:26.369 --> 00:51:28.327
was that vaccinations would go
to those countries.

1063
00:51:28.327 --> 00:51:31.494
So don’t let’s just see it as aid,
because there is a slightly

1064
00:51:31.494 --> 00:51:32.577
patronising aspect to that.

1065
00:51:32.577 --> 00:51:35.869
If we think the only way
that the global poor can ever stop

1066
00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:38.786
being poor is if we give them
hand—outs — usually with political

1067
00:51:38.786 --> 00:51:41.327
strings, by the way.

1068
00:51:41.327 --> 00:51:44.411
So, I would be having a bigger
conversation about aid and it’s not

1069
00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:47.827
about being little Britain and not
helping people out, it’s

1070
00:51:47.827 --> 00:51:49.994
about being appropriate
about what you do in terms

1071
00:51:49.994 --> 00:51:51.036
of global poverty.

1072
00:51:51.036 --> 00:51:54.077
Vaughan.

1073
00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:57.619
Well, this is a clear breach
of a manifesto promise.

1074
00:51:57.619 --> 00:52:00.286
The amount would, of
course, be going down —

1075
00:52:00.286 --> 00:52:02.661
because GDP is shrinking
across the UK, we’d actually be

1076
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:05.994
providing less of a sum.

1077
00:52:05.994 --> 00:52:09.119
This is a choice to have an even
bigger cut to that budget.

1078
00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:10.744
I don’t often agree
with David Cameron,

1079
00:52:10.744 --> 00:52:12.911
but I think he’s right on this.

1080
00:52:12.911 --> 00:52:17.869
I think it’s the wrong time to cede
part of our global leadership,

1081
00:52:18.077 --> 00:52:21.661
it sends out the wrong signal
about who we want to be in the UK.

1082
00:52:21.661 --> 00:52:23.036
And this isn’t simply
about hand—outs.

1083
00:52:23.036 --> 00:52:24.702
I mean, I’ve been...

1084
00:52:24.702 --> 00:52:27.661
As part of our much smaller Wales
for Africa programme —

1085
00:52:27.661 --> 00:52:30.119
I’ve been to Uganda,
and I’ve seen what our development

1086
00:52:30.119 --> 00:52:31.786
projects do, working together
with local communities.

1087
00:52:31.786 --> 00:52:34.286
Actually helping them to build
and develop and deliver

1088
00:52:34.286 --> 00:52:36.952
in a more sustainable way,
and that has a real impact.

1089
00:52:36.952 --> 00:52:41.036
And that benefits us
as well, I think.

1090
00:52:41.036 --> 00:52:44.494
In a time of more global
uncertainty, what we can do to help

1091
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:48.077
other parts of the world become more
stable in the way we use our budgets

1092
00:52:48.077 --> 00:52:49.702
really does matter.

1093
00:52:49.702 --> 00:52:53.494
And I don’t think you need to say
we can’t help other vulnerable

1094
00:52:53.494 --> 00:52:56.911
or poorer people unless we deal
with our own first.

1095
00:52:56.911 --> 00:52:59.827
Because actually, we are already
told that you can’t help some people

1096
00:52:59.827 --> 00:53:02.327
within our country without punishing
others as well.

1097
00:53:02.327 --> 00:53:05.661
It’s the wrong argument to have and,
actually, we have enough resources

1098
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:09.119
in this country to look
after our own people

1099
00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:11.786
and to still maintain the level
of global leadership

1100
00:53:11.786 --> 00:53:14.952
and the commitments we have
made and put into law.

1101
00:53:14.952 --> 00:53:18.369
So I look forward to seeing
what happens when the bill has to go

1102
00:53:18.369 --> 00:53:21.411
through both Houses of Parliament
because, as I say, it’s a direct

1103
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:24.286
breach of a manifesto commitment
and I think it’s the wrong choice

1104
00:53:24.286 --> 00:53:26.452
and it does say something
about the values that

1105
00:53:26.452 --> 00:53:27.619
drive this UK Government.

1106
00:53:27.619 --> 00:53:30.661
I want to try and squeeze in one
more question from Michael Brennan.

1107
00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:34.036
Hello, thank you, Fiona.

1108
00:53:34.036 --> 00:53:36.661
Coronavirus has led to all four
nations taking their own approach

1109
00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:38.119
to controlling the pandemic.

1110
00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:40.494
Will this provide the ground that
will support the notion

1111
00:53:40.494 --> 00:53:42.369
of a Welsh Independence vote?

1112
00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:46.869
Well, go on, Adam,
you have a run—in at this first.

1113
00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:49.702
Yeah, I mean, that’s something that
has been a theme, hasn’t it,

1114
00:53:49.702 --> 00:53:53.536
throughout the pandemic?

1115
00:53:53.536 --> 00:53:55.161
Because we’ve seen
the surging support,

1116
00:53:55.161 --> 00:54:00.202
the highest ever level of support
new for independence in Wales.

1117
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:03.327
That’s partly because I think
of the contrast...

1118
00:54:03.327 --> 00:54:04.369
Not for Plaid Cymru.

1119
00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:06.286
I mean, support for independence
is significantly higher

1120
00:54:06.286 --> 00:54:08.411
than support for your party.

1121
00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:09.827
Yeah, well, you’re right,
it’s interesting.

1122
00:54:09.827 --> 00:54:14.786
50% of Labour support, they won’t be
that pleased about this,

1123
00:54:27.494 --> 00:54:29.786
but 50% of Labour supporters in some
opinion polls are

1124
00:54:29.786 --> 00:54:30.869
supporting independence.

1125
00:54:30.869 --> 00:54:32.077
So there’s definitely
something happening.

1126
00:54:32.077 --> 00:54:35.661
And I think it’s partly
the contrast between,

1127
00:54:35.661 --> 00:54:38.786
as one of the audience members said,
I think between the rather shambolic

1128
00:54:38.786 --> 00:54:40.702
approach to the pandemic
that we’ve seen sadly

1129
00:54:40.702 --> 00:54:42.869
from the Westminster Government
to do better, more consistent,

1130
00:54:42.869 --> 00:54:44.619
coherent approach from the devolved
administrations, including

1131
00:54:44.619 --> 00:54:45.619
the Welsh Government.

1132
00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:48.702
I think there’s a sense in Wales
generally as well, as a nation,

1133
00:54:48.702 --> 00:54:50.411
that we’ve done some
incredible work together.

1134
00:54:50.411 --> 00:54:51.452
The government, yes.

1135
00:54:51.452 --> 00:54:52.452
The community.

1136
00:54:52.452 --> 00:54:55.369
And we’ve shown as a small nation
that we can do this.

1137
00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:56.786
And there are many decisions that...

1138
00:54:56.786 --> 00:54:57.827
As an independent country,

1139
00:54:57.827 --> 00:55:02.786
we could have introduced
Universal Basic Income,

1140
00:55:03.869 --> 00:55:06.286
so those self—employed people that
I’ve referred to wouldn’t have

1141
00:55:06.286 --> 00:55:07.327
been left reeling.

1142
00:55:07.327 --> 00:55:09.952
And I think people look at some
of the small countries.

1143
00:55:09.952 --> 00:55:12.077
We were talking of mass testing
earlier, weren’t we?

1144
00:55:12.077 --> 00:55:13.161
Look at Slovakia.

1145
00:55:13.161 --> 00:55:14.202
Tested the entire nation.

1146
00:55:14.202 --> 00:55:16.369
The first country in
the world to do so.

1147
00:55:16.369 --> 00:55:18.744
And look at those many success
stories during the pandemic,

1148
00:55:18.744 --> 00:55:21.661
both economically and in health
terms, many of them have been small,

1149
00:55:21.661 --> 00:55:22.661
independent countries.

1150
00:55:22.661 --> 00:55:25.077
And I think people in Wales
are inspired by that.

1151
00:55:25.077 --> 00:55:27.494
You know, we need a bit
of inspiration and hope,

1152
00:55:27.494 --> 00:55:29.661
and I think independence is part
of that feeling.

1153
00:55:29.661 --> 00:55:30.661
Do you know what?

1154
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.369
As a country, we can do this.

1155
00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:34.244
Vaughan.

1156
00:55:34.244 --> 00:55:37.077
My friend is 30 today and I think
on his 40th birthday

1157
00:55:37.077 --> 00:55:42.119
will still be part of the UK.

1158
00:55:42.286 --> 00:55:44.452
The prospect of that lessened,
though, given the action

1159
00:55:44.452 --> 00:55:45.494
of this Prime Minister.

1160
00:55:45.494 --> 00:55:46.911
He is the biggest
recruiting sergeant

1161
00:55:46.911 --> 00:55:47.952
for the independence movement.

1162
00:55:47.952 --> 00:55:50.827
And that is the way he’s gone
about notjust this pandemic

1163
00:55:50.827 --> 00:55:53.244
handling, the way he’s spoken
about parts of the Union,

1164
00:55:53.244 --> 00:55:55.911
his actions in office.

1165
00:55:55.911 --> 00:56:00.952
And I think the real challenge
here is if you do believe the union

1166
00:56:01.077 --> 00:56:03.952
of the UK gives Wales the best
chance, with a devolved national

1167
00:56:03.952 --> 00:56:07.077
vote, to make our own choices,
make our own decisions in a range

1168
00:56:07.077 --> 00:56:09.702
of areas, but still benefit
from being part of a wider

1169
00:56:09.702 --> 00:56:11.869
union of countries then,
actually, the way that this

1170
00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:15.244
government has gone about a range
of choices and the way that we have

1171
00:56:15.244 --> 00:56:16.661
sometimes been treated
with real contempt...

1172
00:56:16.661 --> 00:56:19.077
For example, HS2 spend is counted
as England and Wales,

1173
00:56:19.077 --> 00:56:22.911
yet not a single inch of H52 track
or spend is going to come to Wales.

1174
00:56:22.911 --> 00:56:24.661
It’s a detriment
to the Welsh economy.

1175
00:56:24.661 --> 00:56:26.327
But this government decides
that that’s actually

1176
00:56:26.327 --> 00:56:27.369
England and Wales funds.

1177
00:56:27.369 --> 00:56:31.411
That costs real money
for people in Wales,

1178
00:56:31.411 --> 00:56:36.411
a real detriment to
infrastructure spend.

1179
00:56:36.494 --> 00:56:39.411
So there’s a real challenge
here in the tone and the performance

1180
00:56:39.411 --> 00:56:40.411
of this government.

1181
00:56:40.411 --> 00:56:45.411
If they’re serious about the union,
they need to act like they’re

1182
00:56:45.494 --> 00:56:48.411
a government before the whole
of the United Kingdom and show more

1183
00:56:48.411 --> 00:56:50.577
respect for people in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland.

1184
00:56:50.577 --> 00:56:53.661
And they can do something about that
by taking a very different approach

1185
00:56:53.661 --> 00:56:56.036
to the Internal Markets Bill,
which is a direct assault

1186
00:56:56.036 --> 00:56:58.244
on devolution and Welsh
farmers are going to find

1187
00:56:58.244 --> 00:57:01.286
they are going to pay
the price for the choices

1188
00:57:01.286 --> 00:57:02.619
this
Government has made.

1189
00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.036
Because the betrayal in the current
statement from the Chancellor

1190
00:57:05.036 --> 00:57:07.661
yesterday does show a significant
cut in money going to rural

1191
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:09.577
communities, and a straightforward
power grab for devolved

1192
00:57:09.577 --> 00:57:10.619
responsibilities.

1193
00:57:10.619 --> 00:57:12.744
It’s absolutely not the way
to safeguard the union

1194
00:57:12.744 --> 00:57:13.786
of the United Kingdom.

1195
00:57:13.786 --> 00:57:14.827
Tanni.

1196
00:57:14.827 --> 00:57:17.286
I was born and spent sort
of the vast majority

1197
00:57:17.286 --> 00:57:18.661
of my life living in Wales.

1198
00:57:18.661 --> 00:57:21.369
The only reason I left
was because of my husband’s job.

1199
00:57:21.369 --> 00:57:23.702
And it’s been interesting living
in England and then seeing

1200
00:57:23.702 --> 00:57:26.369
the reaction in Wales and Scotland
and Northern Ireland to devolution

1201
00:57:26.369 --> 00:57:28.327
and the increase of desire for it.

1202
00:57:28.327 --> 00:57:31.994
Ithink, you know, I’d be really
upset for the UK to split up,

1203
00:57:31.994 --> 00:57:35.327
but I think that’s partly being 3 GB
athlete and those things as well.

1204
00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:37.744
But I think what people
want to feel is connected

1205
00:57:37.744 --> 00:57:42.702
to their decision—makers.

1206
00:57:46.202 --> 00:57:51.161
And one thing I’m really conscious
of where I live now...

1207
00:57:54.661 --> 00:57:56.827
And, you know, Iwork
in the Westminster bubble

1208
00:57:56.827 --> 00:57:58.286
in London, which is a bubble.

1209
00:57:58.286 --> 00:58:00.452
You know, we are a long
way from London.

1210
00:58:00.452 --> 00:58:01.494
Economically, socially.

1211
00:58:01.494 --> 00:58:04.411
Pre—lockdown, it was cheaper to fly
to Europe than it was to

1212
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:05.619
get a train to London.

1213
00:58:05.619 --> 00:58:07.744
And so, I think people
want to feel connected,

1214
00:58:07.744 --> 00:58:10.411
they want to feel in control,
they want to feel engaged,

1215
00:58:10.411 --> 00:58:11.827
that their vote makes a difference.

1216
00:58:11.827 --> 00:58:14.661
And I think this is a problem
for all of British politics,

1217
00:58:14.661 --> 00:58:16.411
in terms of how people
are disengaged.

1218
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:19.744
I go to a lot of schools and young
people say, I hate politics.

1219
00:58:19.744 --> 00:58:22.619
And I go, no, you might not like
watching Prime Minister’s Questions.

1220
00:58:22.619 --> 00:58:24.994
For a moment there, Tanni,
I thought you might say

1221
00:58:24.994 --> 00:58:26.911
Question Time, but you held
back, well done!

1222
00:58:26.911 --> 00:58:28.411
I almost had a panic there!

1223
00:58:28.411 --> 00:58:29.411
So did I!

1224
00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:32.577
You know, if we don’t engage people
and we don’t have people thinking

1225
00:58:32.577 --> 00:58:33.952
that their vote has a say...

1226
00:58:33.952 --> 00:58:37.577
And we know that young people,
if they don’t vote in the first

1227
00:58:37.577 --> 00:58:40.244
general election after they’re 18,
their chance of voting will drop

1228
00:58:40.244 --> 00:58:42.411
again and again and again,
and then they become

1229
00:58:42.411 --> 00:58:43.452
even less engaged.

1230
00:58:43.452 --> 00:58:48.411
So I think what people want is,
they want to feel that

1231
00:58:48.661 --> 00:58:50.952
their politicians are listening
to them, that they understand them,

1232
00:58:50.952 --> 00:58:53.411
that they are not disconnected.

1233
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:58.452
And that is why I think we’re seeing
a greater call for independence.

1234
00:59:02.494 --> 00:59:05.327
So, Nadhim, Vaughan Gething saying
that BorisJohnson has proven to be

1235
00:59:05.327 --> 00:59:07.244
the best recruiting sergeant
for independence in Wales.

1236
00:59:07.244 --> 00:59:10.411
We had the SNP on last week saying
the same thing for Scotland.

1237
00:59:10.411 --> 00:59:11.411
Well, I don’t agree.

1238
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:14.577
I think devolution worked for Boris
when he was London Mayor by focusing

1239
00:59:14.577 --> 00:59:16.494
on what Londoners wanted,
which is better security,

1240
00:59:16.494 --> 00:59:19.661
better housing, cleaner air.

1241
00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:23.577
And I think devolution needs to be
seen, I think to Tanni’s point,

1242
00:59:23.577 --> 00:59:26.494
people need to see it working.

1243
00:59:26.494 --> 00:59:27.494
We’re much stronger together.

1244
00:59:27.494 --> 00:59:29.036
Vaughan talks about
the internal market.

1245
00:59:29.036 --> 00:59:30.952
The internal market
is the most successful market

1246
00:59:30.952 --> 00:59:32.911
probably in the world.

1247
00:59:32.911 --> 00:59:35.077
Wales sells to the rest
of the United Kingdom...

1248
00:59:35.077 --> 00:59:36.994
But he’s talking about
the Internal Markets Bill.

1249
00:59:36.994 --> 00:59:38.036
That’s my point, exactly.

1250
00:59:38.036 --> 00:59:41.536
Wales sells to the rest of the UK
about 30 billion and buys back

1251
00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:45.577
about 32 billion from the rest
of the UK.

1252
00:59:45.577 --> 00:59:48.411
Those companies in Wales need to be
able to sell that freely

1253
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:50.202
without restrictions.

1254
00:59:50.202 --> 00:59:53.286
And buy without restriction.

1255
00:59:53.286 --> 00:59:57.369
That’s why the Internal Markets Bill
is so important, Fiona.

1256
00:59:57.369 --> 01:00:00.702
And actually, Wales is £5 billion,
you know, additional spending

1257
01:00:00.702 --> 01:00:02.661
through the pandemic
because of the United Kingdom

1258
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:05.744
being together and stronger.

1259
01:00:05.744 --> 01:00:07.661
The devolved administrations,
£16 billion of additional spending.

1260
01:00:07.661 --> 01:00:11.036
That’s a good thing.

1261
01:00:11.036 --> 01:00:16.077
I talked to my colleagues
from Wales, Ken Skates

1262
01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:20.577
and Fiona Hyslop and Diane Dodds
in Northern Ireland,

1263
01:00:20.577 --> 01:00:22.494
almost on a weekly basis
during the crisis.

1264
01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:23.869
We have an excellent
working relationship.

1265
01:00:23.869 --> 01:00:27.661
I think, actually, what people
in Swansea, in Glasgow and in London

1266
01:00:27.661 --> 01:00:32.702
needs to see is their politicians
working much closer together

1267
01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:35.327
in this difficult time
because we’re much stronger united.

1268
01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:38.702
Claire, we are very nearly out
of time, but I just want to give

1269
01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:40.161
you a chance with this question.

1270
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:42.577
The fact that coronavirus has
led to the four nations

1271
01:00:42.577 --> 01:00:44.702
taking their own approach in terms
of controlling coronavirus.

1272
01:00:44.702 --> 01:00:45.911
I think it’s been divisive.

1273
01:00:45.911 --> 01:00:48.327
I don’t actually think it’s been
helpfulfor the union.

1274
01:00:48.327 --> 01:00:50.494
I think it’s also created
a sense of confusion

1275
01:00:50.494 --> 01:00:53.619
about the United Kingdom myself.

1276
01:00:53.619 --> 01:00:58.536
I think it’s wrong to suggest that
if you’ve got politicians physically

1277
01:00:58.536 --> 01:01:03.536
closer, that they’re going to be
more in touch with you.

1278
01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:08.577
Let me assure you, as somebody
from North Wales, having

1279
01:01:10.161 --> 01:01:12.327
the Senedd in Cardiff,
there is a clique of

1280
01:01:12.327 --> 01:01:13.369
people around the Senedd.

1281
01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:16.744
That doesn’t mean that
people in North Wales feel

1282
01:01:16.744 --> 01:01:18.036
like they’re closer.

1283
01:01:18.036 --> 01:01:19.952
It’s a political question,
not a physical one.

1284
01:01:19.952 --> 01:01:22.619
And I think that there’s been
a huge amount of problems

1285
01:01:22.619 --> 01:01:24.952
with the Welsh administration.

1286
01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:26.661
School education standards
have been abysmal under

1287
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:29.119
the present administration.

1288
01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:34.119
I was yesterday in the House
of Lords looking at the mental

1289
01:01:34.452 --> 01:01:36.369
health legislation where,
thank goodness, the Coronavirus Act

1290
01:01:36.369 --> 01:01:38.994
which gave the power to section
people with just one doctor

1291
01:01:38.994 --> 01:01:41.411
and for a long time,
which should never have been

1292
01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:43.327
there in the first place,
has been repealed.

1293
01:01:43.327 --> 01:01:44.536
Wales have kept it on.

1294
01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:46.911
I mean, don’t ask me why
because it’s absolutely draconian.

1295
01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:49.077
We had Mark Drakeford telling
us what was essential

1296
01:01:49.077 --> 01:01:50.119
and nonessential shopping.

1297
01:01:50.119 --> 01:01:52.036
No, I don’t necessarily
think that the handling

1298
01:01:52.036 --> 01:01:53.036
of the coronavirus. ..

1299
01:01:53.036 --> 01:01:55.494
And by the way, all sorts
of problems of testing

1300
01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:56.911
at the beginning, and they did...

1301
01:01:56.911 --> 01:01:59.577
I’m going to have to hurry you,
I’m sorry, Claire, we’re

1302
01:01:59.577 --> 01:02:00.619
running out of time.

1303
01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:01.661
..care homes in Wales.

1304
01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:04.286
So, yeah, I think it’s much more
complicated than saying, oh,

1305
01:02:04.286 --> 01:02:07.411
there you go, itjust shows Wales
can go on its own, then.

1306
01:02:07.411 --> 01:02:09.827
No, it doesn’t.

1307
01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:12.994
It needs to be interrogated
and they need to be held to account

1308
01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.161
for the mistakes they’ve made.

1309
01:02:14.161 --> 01:02:15.369
That’s why we have elections.

1310
01:02:15.369 --> 01:02:16.411
Exactly.

1311
01:02:16.411 --> 01:02:19.744
I’m going to end it here, simply
because we are running out of time.

1312
01:02:19.744 --> 01:02:22.869
I’m so sorry because I can see this
could go backwards and forwards

1313
01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:23.911
for quite some time.

1314
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:26.119
But our time is up, our hour is up.

1315
01:02:26.119 --> 01:02:27.536
Tonight, our questions
came from Swansea.

1316
01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:30.119
Next week, we’ll be joined
by an audience in Bath and,

1317
01:02:30.119 --> 01:02:31.411
the week after that,
Chelmsford.

1318
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:36.452
So, do get in touch,
comejoin the debate.

1319
01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:39.036
You can apply on the
Question Time website,

1320
01:02:39.036 --> 01:02:42.869
and you fill in the form there,
and let’s see if you can come and be

1321
01:02:42.869 --> 01:02:43.911
part of our audience.

1322
01:02:43.911 --> 01:02:45.369
We would love to see you.

1323
01:02:45.369 --> 01:02:47.744
Adrian Chiles is coming up
on Radio 5 Live with

1324
01:02:47.744 --> 01:02:49.911
Question Time Extra Time,
as always, with his guests.

1325
01:02:49.911 --> 01:02:53.744
You can see on the screen how to get
in touch and put your views there.

1326
01:02:53.744 --> 01:02:57.161
But for now, thank you very much
to the panel here in the studio

1327
01:02:57.161 --> 01:02:59.744
and to Vaughan and Tanni
forjoining me down the line.

1328
01:02:59.744 --> 01:03:02.369
From our audience in Swansea,
thank you very much for being

1329
01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:03.411
part of the programme.

1330
01:03:03.411 --> 01:03:06.536
And of course, to you at home,
thank you very much for watching.

1331
01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:07.577
From Question Time, bye—bye.

1332
01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:10.661
APPLAUSE

1333
01:04:07.036 --> 01:04:10.036
"To Anton,
you’re a great player, mate.

1334
01:04:10.036 --> 01:04:13.911
"Best wishes
and good luck, john Terry.‘

1335
01:04:13.911 --> 01:04:16.661
A few years later,
we were in a massive racism case.

1336
01:04:16.661 --> 01:04:18.286
It’s still described as one of

1337
01:04:18.286 --> 01:04:20.202
the dirtiest West London derbies.

1338
01:04:20.202 --> 01:04:22.702
He wasn’t found guilty
in a court of law.

1339
01:04:22.702 --> 01:04:24.994
You thought, "Crikey,
this is a big story."

1340
01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.369
It’s like it’s become normal again

1341
01:04:27.369 --> 01:04:30.411
and I need to come to terms with
the impact it did have on me.

1342
01:04:52.786 --> 01:04:52.952

1343
01:04:52.952 --> 01:04:55.536
Well, today we are going to be

01:04:55.536 --> 01:04:56.661
joined by the former

Justine Greening.

1346
01:04:57.744 --> 01:05:00.661
Hello.

1347
01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:01.869
Hi, Adam, how are you?

1348
01:05:01.869 --> 01:05:04.036
I’m very well and it’s
going to get better,

1349
01:05:04.036 --> 01:05:06.661
because we are going to start off
with a little quiz,

1350
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:09.619
because I love a quiz
and you are going to get this,

1351
01:05:09.619 --> 01:05:11.036
as a former International
Development Secretary,

1352
01:05:11.036 --> 01:05:13.202
because everyone knows the UK’s
