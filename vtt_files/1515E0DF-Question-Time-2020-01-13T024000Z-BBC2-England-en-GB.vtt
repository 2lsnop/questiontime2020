15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.432
the way. You have to say, he wins it
quite comfortably six frames to

16
00:00:54.432 --> 00:01:01.265
quite comfortably six frames to
three. When you’re on the practice

17
00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:01.807
three. when you’re on the practice
table, you pot

18
00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:02.973
three. When you’re on the practice
table, you pot balls, it only

19
00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:07.432
table, you pot balls, it only
crosses your mind about missing the

20
00:01:07.432 --> 00:01:09.057
crosses your mind about missing the
black but after you miss a couple of

21
00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:10.640
black but after you miss a couple of
easy ones that is all you can think

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.057
easy ones that is all you ran think
about and

23
00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:11.973
easy ones that is all you can think
about and out there, you know when

24
00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:14.057
about and out there, you know when
you miss you get a big gust from the

25
00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:15.265
you miss you get a big gust from the
crowd and it’s quite a horrible

26
00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:17.307
crowd and it’s quite a horrible
experience. You don’t want that to

27
00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:19.765
experience. You don’t want that to
keep repeating time after time. It

28
00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:20.973
keep repeating time after time. It
is acting on your confidence. I

We will catch you then.

00:01:57.557 --> 00:02:00.057
I am an angel, you are a demon.

52
00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:02.265
We’re on opposite sides!

53
00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:03.973
We’re on OUR side.

54
00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.807
The Antichrist has been mislaid.
We have to work together.

55
00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:17.182
A straight battle between heaven
and hell. Tonight, it begins.

56
00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:19.140
I don’t even like you. You do!

57
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.515
Aaagh! We’re doomed.

58
00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:30.515
It’s the first time, I’d say, in my
life that I’ve worn the same thing

59
00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:33.973
that everybody else is wearing but
still felt horrendously embarrassed.

60
00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:38.015
It was at that point that the
session very much got away from me.

61
00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:42.973
But they were nice.
They were very friendly.

62
00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:02.140
Tonight, we are in Oxford.
Welcome to Question Time.

63
00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:12.473
On tonight’s panel, Brandon Lewis,
the Government’s Security Minister

64
00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:17.182
and deputy for exiting the EU
and no—deal preparations.

65
00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:19.182
Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister

66
00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:21.015
and a candidate in the race to be

67
00:03:21.015 --> 00:03:23.182
leader of the Labour Party,
Clive Lewis.

68
00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:27.390
Anne McElvoy, senior editor at
the Economist, and broadcaster.

69
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.057
Miatta Fahnbulleh, economist

70
00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:32.015
and chief executive of
the left—of—centre think—tank,

71
00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:33.557
New Economics Foundation.

72
00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:37.265
And author, military historian
and former editor in chief of

73
00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:39.515
the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings.

74
00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:53.973
Welcome to our panel,
to our audience at home

75
00:03:53.973 --> 00:03:56.682
and all of you here.

76
00:03:56.682 --> 00:04:01.432
You can argue along in the usual way
using the hashtag on Facebook,

77
00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:06.473
Twitter and Instagram. It’s a new
year, let’s kick off with our first

78
00:04:06.473 --> 00:04:11.515
question from Rosie Parry. Is Harry
and Meghan’s decision to step back

79
00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:15.348
as senior royals petulant
and ill—judged?

80
00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:19.182
Right, that was a comment in

81
00:04:19.182 --> 00:04:24.307
the Times, petty and ill—judged, in
their editorial today. Megxit, as it

82
00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:30.432
has been dubbed now, inevitably.
Clive Lewis, where do you stand?

83
00:04:30.432 --> 00:04:33.807
No, it isn’t. First of all I would
say about Meghan Markle, she has

84
00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:38.598
been a breath of fresh air for our
monarchy. She has been a role model,

85
00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:42.140
inspirational, herwork with
charities, in particular with the

86
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.390
victims of Grenfell, has been
outstanding. I think the way she has

87
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.432
been treated by our media is
little short of disgraceful.

88
00:04:53.432 --> 00:04:55.682
In what in particular?

89
00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:59.473
I think Prince Harry himself
has said himself that he

90
00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:02.057
thinks there is a large degree
of racism in terms of

91
00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:03.432
how she has been treated.

92
00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:06.765
It has been quite appalling.
He pointed to what

93
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.057
happened in South Africa with the
tour and the royal correspondents

94
00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:13.473
reporting, and he also said
something about the fact that

95
00:05:13.473 --> 00:05:15.890
sometimes what is being said is
so far from the truth,

96
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.182
but because it has come

97
00:05:18.182 --> 00:05:21.223
from royal correspondents, it has
been repeated around the world.

98
00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:24.098
Anybody in the public eye in
this country knows that happens far

99
00:05:24.098 --> 00:05:27.640
too often in our media. He said
royal correspondents’ reporting

100
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.973
would get misreported. It would get
misreported, but they were basing it

101
00:05:31.973 --> 00:05:35.515
on what was said by those
royal correspondents.

102
00:05:35.515 --> 00:05:37.932
Let’s be clear and frank here,

103
00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:42.223
I think it’s up to them in the 21st
century, if they wish to step back

104
00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:48.140
from their royal duties. I think,
given what it has done to them,

105
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.140
given the pressure and stress,

106
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.557
if you have ever been in
the public eye and the eye

107
00:05:52.557 --> 00:05:56.807
of a media storm, let’s not forget
that Prince Harry’s mother was

108
00:05:56.807 --> 00:06:01.223
harassed severely, Princess Diana,
by the media. He has seen this

109
00:06:01.223 --> 00:06:03.557
before and it has had a massive
impact on his life

110
00:06:03.557 --> 00:06:05.432
and now it is happening to his wife.

111
00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:09.057
He has every right, and she has
every right, to step back from

112
00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:14.432
public life and do as they see fit.
I also think as well, Meghan Markle

113
00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:19.432
is one of the most privileged people
in this country. And yet, look at

114
00:06:19.432 --> 00:06:23.765
what our media is doing to her
and Prince Harry.

115
00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:25.640
It is completely unacceptable.

116
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.307
I think they have every right
to make the decision they have.

117
00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:32.682
Is itjust the media that
is making them do this? Looking

118
00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:37.223
through their website today, they
explained their reasoning, in some

119
00:06:37.223 --> 00:06:40.432
detail, they want to live
a different kind of life as well.

120
00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:42.140
Yes, they do,

121
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.473
but we have to take into account
that this probably wouldn’t happen,

122
00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.598
and it is speculation on my part,
but this probably wouldn’t

123
00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:52.765
have happened if there hadn’t been
such a negative coverage

124
00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:54.932
from the British media.

125
00:06:54.932 --> 00:06:59.848
This is the same British media that
is meant to be the fourth estate,

126
00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:04.223
meant to hold power and the public
to account. It is meant to be fair

127
00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:08.223
and balanced. It is anything but.
I think what you can see in the way

128
00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:12.557
she has been treated as a member of
the royal family is little short of

129
00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:16.057
a disgrace, as far as I am
concerned, and I think they have

130
00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:18.265
every right to do what
they have done.

131
00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:21.307
As for the issue of
warning Her Majesty about this,

132
00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:26.307
I personally feel that’s
a family matter between them.

133
00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:29.432
I understand Her Majesty might be
upset about that,

134
00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:31.765
but ultimately, it’s a family matter

135
00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:34.765
and I don’t think I would want
to delve into that.

136
00:07:34.765 --> 00:07:37.932
Max? I agree with about half
of what Clive said.

137
00:07:37.932 --> 00:07:41.932
I think Meghan Markle and Prince
Harry deserve tremendous sympathy,

138
00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:46.848
because it is hell being royal, it
is incredibly difficult being royal.

139
00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:50.807
I don’t buy the view that it is
all racist. You mentioned Diana.

140
00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:52.515
I was a newspaper editor

141
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:55.432
at the time that Diana was in
the eye of the storm.

142
00:07:55.432 --> 00:08:00.390
An awful lot of royals have had
a very bad time, you can argue,

143
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.057
from the media, without the issue
of race being brought into it.

144
00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:08.265
The question, Max, is was their
decision petulant and ill—judged?

145
00:08:08.265 --> 00:08:13.515
I also feel very sorry for the Queen
in all this. She is in her 905 and

146
00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:17.765
now facing more of these family
storms. I think one of the problems

147
00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:21.432
that... perhaps cos she has lived to
such a great age, nobody has got to

148
00:08:21.432 --> 00:08:25.557
grips with the issue of what is
the royal family supposed to be.

149
00:08:25.557 --> 00:08:28.390
The idea... Prince Charles
is dead right to talk about

150
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.432
a slimmed—down royal family,

151
00:08:30.432 --> 00:08:34.140
in which the state is not
expected to pay 2.4 million for

152
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.140
Prince Harry’s house, in which there
is a clear understanding of what is

153
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.307
and isn’t expected of lesser royals.
We are all arguing all the time and

154
00:08:43.307 --> 00:08:46.682
I think they are the victims of this
in some degree, because nobody has

155
00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:50.682
told them explicitlyjust what is
and is not expected of them, so they

156
00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:54.848
deserve sympathy, but Prince
Charles, William and the Queen

157
00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:59.432
deserve sympathy in all this.
But I hope they will keep talking.

158
00:08:59.432 --> 00:09:01.390
There is obviously a hell of
a row going on

159
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.140
in that family and the worst
thing that could happen

160
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.807
is if they end up non—speakers.

161
00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:09.432
They’ve got to keep talking
and see a way through this.

162
00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:11.307
One hopes it will be a happy one,

163
00:09:11.307 --> 00:09:15.223
not only for Meghan and Prince
Harry, but also for the Queen and

164
00:09:15.223 --> 00:09:18.890
the future of the monarchy, which
some of us care passionately about.

165
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.640
The man in the check shirt.

166
00:09:23.057 --> 00:09:25.723
Would their financial...
their seeking financial

167
00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:28.973
independence not have been better
before the multi—million—pound

168
00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:31.140
renovation of Frogmore Cottage?

169
00:09:32.807 --> 00:09:37.098
Yes, they are talking about living
financially independently.

170
00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:40.057
Let’s just take another question
at the front. With the sweater. ..

171
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:42.723
I am perfectly happy to see them
live their own life, do whatever

172
00:09:42.723 --> 00:09:45.348
they want. They are humans,
like we all are.

173
00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:47.098
But shouldn’t they immediately stop

174
00:09:47.098 --> 00:09:49.723
taking public money
as they step down?

175
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:52.473
Instead of, I think they said today,
"move towards that".

176
00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:58.723
Yes, they have said they will work
to become financially independent.

177
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:02.307
Who pays for the royals? Certainly,
in terms of security, that comes

178
00:10:02.307 --> 00:10:06.390
underyouraegis, Brandon. Yes. Are
you happy, if they step back from

179
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.182
their role as senior members of the
royalfamily, will you keep paying

180
00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:11.765
for their security?

181
00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:15.890
I’m sure you are not surprised that
I can’t comment on the security...

182
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.265
You are Security Minister.

183
00:10:17.265 --> 00:10:20.515
It’s inappropriate for me to comment
on security issues for any

184
00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:24.807
protected person, royalfamily
or otherwise protected.

185
00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:27.932
Surely you can tell us whether you
would be happy to keep funding it?

186
00:10:27.932 --> 00:10:31.307
No, all protection for the royal
family is done on a risk—assessed

187
00:10:31.307 --> 00:10:34.765
basis, independently. It does come
within my remit, but it would be

188
00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:36.682
inappropriate for me to comment on

189
00:10:36.682 --> 00:10:40.015
how we arrange, and what we do for
security for protected people.

190
00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.557
What I would say, and I think this
is where there is an element of

191
00:10:42.557 --> 00:10:47.557
agreement between Clive and Max and
myself, I agree with what Clive

192
00:10:47.557 --> 00:10:51.723
pointed out at the beginning. Harry
and Meghan, and the royalfamily

193
00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:55.598
generally, do amazing work for the
country and particularly for charity

194
00:10:55.598 --> 00:10:59.807
and good causes. We are very lucky,
and I’m proud to be in a country

195
00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:04.682
that has a royal family like that.
But Max is also right, this is

196
00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:08.307
a matterfor the royalfamily, and
I hope we end up in a position where

197
00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:10.432
the royal family get a result that
is good for them

198
00:11:10.432 --> 00:11:12.723
and good for the country.

199
00:11:12.723 --> 00:11:15.307
One thing we have seen through
the history of our country

200
00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:19.182
is the royal family has evolved
over the centuries and over the

201
00:11:19.182 --> 00:11:22.765
generations, to reflect the country,
and I am sure we’ll continue to

202
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:26.182
see that, but this is a matter for
the royal family. Can you see

203
00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:29.598
a situation where Harry and Meghan
live independently but are still

204
00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:31.723
part of the royal family?
Some would see that

205
00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:34.807
as a contradiction in terms.
Can you see that working?

206
00:11:34.807 --> 00:11:37.473
We will have to wait and see
exactly what the royal family

207
00:11:37.473 --> 00:11:40.890
want to do and where they will go
with this. I think it’s

208
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.182
difficult to prejudge what they
might do. We should also be clear

209
00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:47.015
that the royal family is notjust
funded through the public purse.

210
00:11:47.015 --> 00:11:51.765
They have funding through the family
itself and their own interests.

211
00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:54.223
Anne, I saw you shaking
your head in some frustration

212
00:11:54.223 --> 00:11:55.723
when Clive was talking.

213
00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:58.973
A little bit. Let me with
the position of the Sussexes.

214
00:11:58.973 --> 00:12:02.098
It depends on whether their aim
is still to be

215
00:12:02.098 --> 00:12:04.265
in the royal family or not.

216
00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.515
They said they don’t want
to be senior royals,

217
00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.640
but that is a somewhat
different question.

218
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.015
They say they want to continue
to collaborate with the Queen

219
00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:15.765
and support royal charities.

220
00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:19.265
It’s not picking off some menu.
That’s the slight problem.

221
00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:22.598
You have a model of the royal
family, and I do think

222
00:12:22.598 --> 00:12:25.140
a slimmed—down royal family
is where we need to head.

223
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.348
I think Prince Charles
was right about that.

224
00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:30.640
That is now happening by necessity,
not by choice.

225
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.015
The question is then,
what is the role of those who,

226
00:12:34.015 --> 00:12:37.932
if you like, are in the outer core?
They are an attractive couple who

227
00:12:37.932 --> 00:12:42.182
have brought a breath of fresh air
to the royalfamily. I interviewed

228
00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:45.557
Meghan Markle, in a panel of other
people, last year. Ifound her very

229
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:50.098
engaging, professional to work with,
I liked her focus on subjects like

230
00:12:50.098 --> 00:12:54.473
girls’ education worldwide.
I liked the fact she had an

231
00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:59.182
international dynamic to what she
brought to it. But you can do a lot

232
00:12:59.182 --> 00:13:00.973
of that from a different platform.

233
00:13:00.973 --> 00:13:02.932
If you want to stay
somehow connected

234
00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:06.807
to the royalfamily, being a
semi—demi—royal, with a bit of time

235
00:13:06.807 --> 00:13:10.807
at Frogmore Cottage, and a lot of it
in North America, is going to

236
00:13:10.807 --> 00:13:14.098
be very difficult to pull off.
It will need to be very strategic.

237
00:13:14.098 --> 00:13:18.307
Max Hastings said rightly that
it needs to be done by agreement.

238
00:13:18.307 --> 00:13:21.640
It can’t be done by an exchange
of hostile communications,

239
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.890
as we have had in the last day
or so.

240
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.390
So, something’s gone badly wrong.

241
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.515
It may be salvageable, but it does
needs thinking through.

242
00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:31.682
The reason I disagree with Clive...

243
00:13:31.682 --> 00:13:35.182
We talk about the media and poor
coverage — yes, it must be very

244
00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:37.307
bruising to get coverage
you don’t like —

245
00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:39.473
sometimes, that even happens
to politicians.

246
00:13:39.473 --> 00:13:41.057
MAX: Can I mention...

247
00:13:41.057 --> 00:13:44.807
Max, what I was about to say, I
think most coverage, including the

248
00:13:44.807 --> 00:13:48.348
broadcasters, is very, very positive
in the UK. We often don’t report

249
00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:51.432
a lot of things people say when
they don’t like the royals.

250
00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:54.057
I think you have to
calibrate it

251
00:13:54.057 --> 00:13:57.057
and they have to roll with that,
if they want to still be

252
00:13:57.057 --> 00:14:01.848
connected to the firm.
One short, brutal point about money.

253
00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:05.848
One issue that will face
the Sussexes if they do step down,

254
00:14:05.848 --> 00:14:09.473
they will find an awful lot of
people, especially in North America,

255
00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:12.890
who want to give them money,
but they are absolutely

256
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.265
the worst sort of people,
and probably most of them,

257
00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:18.473
they should not be taking
money from. And this issue...

258
00:14:18.473 --> 00:14:20.765
You mean in terms
of commercial endorsements?

259
00:14:20.765 --> 00:14:23.098
Whether it’s lending them yachts,

260
00:14:23.098 --> 00:14:26.307
all the people who are most eager
to hang around royals

261
00:14:26.307 --> 00:14:28.473
are almost, ipso facto, the people

262
00:14:28.473 --> 00:14:31.473
who the royals shouldn’t be
hanging around with.

263
00:14:31.473 --> 00:14:35.140
How they overcome that problem
will be very difficult for them.

264
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.932
Miatta, one thing that occurs to me,

265
00:14:36.932 --> 00:14:41.848
this idea of growing
financial independence.

266
00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:44.848
We have seen that before, thinking
of the Count and Countess of Wessex,

267
00:14:44.848 --> 00:14:48.140
with the TV production company,
the PR company,

268
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.765
and in the end, the Queen
ended up giving them money

269
00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:54.640
so they wouldn’t do that any longer.
Can you see that working?

270
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.307
I think you can see it working.

271
00:14:57.307 --> 00:14:59.640
It’s a question of imagination
and will.

272
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.682
At the end of the day,
for me, I have

273
00:15:01.682 --> 00:15:05.182
a lot of sympathy for Harry and
Meghan. I think they have been given

274
00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:08.390
a really rough ride. You just have
to look at some of the coverage

275
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.932
overnight around their decision,

276
00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:13.973
which has been really vile
and excessive,

277
00:15:13.973 --> 00:15:18.765
to see that actually, it’s been
hugely unfair. I think, in part,

278
00:15:18.765 --> 00:15:23.807
it’s because Meghan doesn’t conform
to what people, some people, expect

279
00:15:23.807 --> 00:15:27.473
a royal should look like and act
like, and so she has been given

280
00:15:27.473 --> 00:15:30.723
a really tough time. I think
it’s wrong and really sad.

281
00:15:30.723 --> 00:15:32.890
And so, I think,
they are a young family,

282
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.682
they have literallyjust had
a baby, that’s pretty tough

283
00:15:35.682 --> 00:15:38.807
in its own right. They are under
a huge amount of pressure and

284
00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:42.473
they have been really honest about
how unhappy they are, about

285
00:15:42.473 --> 00:15:47.348
mental health issues they are
struggling with, and they have had

286
00:15:47.348 --> 00:15:49.473
a break and decided,
"We want to change things.

287
00:15:49.473 --> 00:15:52.473
"We want to focus on ourselves and
our kid." And I think they are

288
00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:54.807
completely right, and I say
fair play to that.

289
00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:57.723
But I do think it shines a spotlight
yet again on the royal family,

290
00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:01.307
on the monarchy, and I think that
the monarchy, who are

291
00:16:01.307 --> 00:16:06.473
part of our culture, our tradition,
our history, but it needs to be

292
00:16:06.473 --> 00:16:09.515
reformed and it needs to be brought
back into the 21st century.

293
00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:11.348
For me, that means

294
00:16:11.348 --> 00:16:15.723
both constitutional reform, so we
are no longer a nation of subjects,

295
00:16:15.723 --> 00:16:18.723
but a nation of citizens, through to
the fact it needs to be scaled down

296
00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:20.432
so there are less royals,

297
00:16:20.432 --> 00:16:23.432
and the fact that we have this
very privileged and very

298
00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:27.390
wealthy family that should be
financially independent, but also,

299
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.765
actually, wealth that they have
accumulated through centuries,

300
00:16:30.765 --> 00:16:34.432
that they have inherited,
they should be giving some of it

301
00:16:34.432 --> 00:16:38.390
back to the public, because
in the end, it belongs to us.

302
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.015
Three hands up in the front.

303
00:16:40.015 --> 00:16:43.640
Yes, the woman in the cardigan
first, then I’ll come to you, sir.

304
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.932
Isn’t the truth of the matter that
everybody now looks on the monarchy

305
00:16:47.932 --> 00:16:52.390
as a bargain, and unless we get
our pound of flesh from the press,

306
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.265
and in terms of how much money
they bring into the country,

307
00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:00.057
nobody actually believes that
that family should be allowed

308
00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:02.848
to rule the country as right?

309
00:17:02.848 --> 00:17:06.182
We all look at it as a
transactional arrangement now.

310
00:17:06.182 --> 00:17:08.182
And do you think we are
wrong to do that?

311
00:17:08.182 --> 00:17:11.057
No... Well, in a way, Ithink
we are wrong,

312
00:17:11.057 --> 00:17:13.515
but also, the transaction
is in terms of,

313
00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:16.348
how many stories will they
give to the press?

314
00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:18.307
The press turned on Meghan

315
00:17:18.307 --> 00:17:22.682
when she stopped providing so many
photo opportunities for the baby.

316
00:17:22.682 --> 00:17:27.973
Very quickly, they turned on her.
I think we like to see a soap opera,

317
00:17:27.973 --> 00:17:31.973
we like to be provided with
entertainment, and if we don’t get

318
00:17:31.973 --> 00:17:38.015
that entertainment, the country only
is governed by our agreement, and we

319
00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:42.848
feel we have to get value from them
as entertainment, as well as money

320
00:17:42.848 --> 00:17:45.015
being brought into the country.

321
00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:47.223
The royal family have provided
acres of coverage,

322
00:17:47.223 --> 00:17:49.057
in the last couple of months
in particular.

323
00:17:49.057 --> 00:17:50.723
Yes, the man in the yellow shirt.

324
00:17:50.723 --> 00:17:52.890
I’m inclined to agree
with Max, actually.

325
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.890
My sympathy goes to Her Majesty.

326
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.932
In the last year, she had to put up

327
00:17:56.932 --> 00:18:01.848
with what happened
to Prince Andrew, and...

328
00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:06.348
That can’t have been a good day...
It’s a tough time for her.

329
00:18:06.348 --> 00:18:09.515
2019 has been a very tough time.

330
00:18:09.515 --> 00:18:11.640
And her husband was in hospital.

331
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.765
And now this breaking news
about her grandson.

332
00:18:16.765 --> 00:18:19.432
I think what Harry should have done,

333
00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.557
he should have come back from his
holiday, from America and Canada,

334
00:18:22.557 --> 00:18:25.473
taken his time,
perhaps gone to the Queen...

335
00:18:25.473 --> 00:18:28.265
He did go to Her Majesty
when he decided

336
00:18:28.265 --> 00:18:31.890
to marry Meghan. He did ask her
and she gave consent.

337
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.557
What he should have done is gone to
Windsor Castle or Buckingham Palace,

338
00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:38.807
had a chat with his grandmother

339
00:18:38.807 --> 00:18:41.182
and then discussed
what his intentions were,

340
00:18:41.182 --> 00:18:43.765
so that all the protocol
could be followed

341
00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:46.390
and then he could have had
a press release.

342
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.515
But he pre-empted and went and gave
a press release.

343
00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:51.932
There are reports tonight,
I cannot verify one way or

344
00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:55.390
the other, that the Queen was aware
to some extent of what was going

345
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.765
to be announced today.
We just don’t know, do we?

346
00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:03.390
I do agree with Clive,
the British media have literally

347
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.307
tortured them. He is frightened.
He has seen what his mum went

348
00:19:07.307 --> 00:19:11.515
through and he doesn’t want his wife
to go through that. So he’s made

349
00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:15.557
that decision, which I think is
too pre—empted and too early.

350
00:19:15.557 --> 00:19:17.182
The man here in the cap.

351
00:19:18.598 --> 00:19:20.432
Yes, I admire them

352
00:19:20.432 --> 00:19:23.640
for having the courage to come out
and say what they have said

353
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.473
and what they wish for.

354
00:19:25.473 --> 00:19:29.057
I have adult children with families,
and if I started to try

355
00:19:29.057 --> 00:19:32.973
to tell them what to do,
I think I would be out of order.

356
00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.973
And they would, also.

357
00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.848
And also, the question of Frogmore,

358
00:19:37.848 --> 00:19:41.848
if they didn’t occupy that, perhaps
they would give it to the homeless.

359
00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:45.140
Right, fair enough. Can Ijust ask,
out of interest,

360
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.182
is there anyone
in the audience who thinks

361
00:19:47.182 --> 00:19:49.473
that Harry and Meghan
have done the wrong thing?

362
00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:51.015
Not a single hand up.

363
00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:55.307
That’s really interesting. I had no
idea how this conversation would go.

364
00:19:55.307 --> 00:19:56.807
That’s very interesting indeed.

365
00:19:56.807 --> 00:19:59.932
OK, I am going to move on
to another subject, if I may.

366
00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.890
Eric Eimerson.

367
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:09.182
Yes? Has the assassination of
Qasem Soleimani, on the orders of

368
00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:14.432
President Trump, made the world
a safer or a more dangerous place?

369
00:20:14.432 --> 00:20:16.515
Of course,
we have the reports tonight,

370
00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:19.182
we had the Canadian Prime
Minister, who was talking

371
00:20:19.182 --> 00:20:23.765
just before we came on air,
confirming US reports that...

372
00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.848
Well, they believe they have
the information —

373
00:20:25.848 --> 00:20:27.557
Brandon, you ran fill us in
on this -

374
00:20:27.557 --> 00:20:31.598
that the Ukrainian
passenger jet that was downed

375
00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:34.973
just hours after the missiles
went into the US air bases,

376
00:20:34.973 --> 00:20:37.807
following the assassination
of Soleimani,

377
00:20:37.807 --> 00:20:41.432
that this jet was downed
by the Iranians by mistake.

378
00:20:41.432 --> 00:20:43.348
We can’t verify that,

379
00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:45.765
but perhaps you ran tell us more?
Er, yes.

380
00:20:45.765 --> 00:20:47.723
Well, Justin Trudeau’s
made an announcement

381
00:20:47.723 --> 00:20:50.682
as we came on air
and what we believe has happened,

382
00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:55.557
what the Canadians have outlined,
is it looks like the plane

383
00:20:55.557 --> 00:20:57.848
was brought down by
an surface—to—air missile.

384
00:20:57.848 --> 00:21:00.557
We believe it was... Have you
seen intelligence to that effect?

385
00:21:00.557 --> 00:21:03.640
We believe it was unintentional.
I’m not going to...

386
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.015
I’ve just outlined what...
At some point,

387
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.473
I’m going to ask you a question
you can actually answer!

388
00:21:08.473 --> 00:21:10.473
Have you seen intelligence
to that effect?

389
00:21:10.473 --> 00:21:14.098
Yes or no? So I’ve just watched
Justin Trudeau outline the position.

390
00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:15.765
But can you answer that question?

391
00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:18.265
I’m not going to talk about
the intelligence, obviously.

392
00:21:18.265 --> 00:21:20.723
0K, all right. Fair enough.
It would be inappropriate.

393
00:21:20.723 --> 00:21:22.890
But what I can say is we do believe

394
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.807
the pointJustin Trudeau
has outlined,

395
00:21:24.807 --> 00:21:28.515
which is that a surface—to—air
missile has hit that plane.

396
00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:31.182
We believe it was unintentional.

397
00:21:31.182 --> 00:21:34.640
We do... We’ll be working
with our Canadian colleagues,

398
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.057
and the Prime Minister’s spoken to
our partners around the world,

399
00:21:39.057 --> 00:21:43.265
including in the EU, with
President Macron and Angela Merkel,

400
00:21:43.265 --> 00:21:45.348
supporting them
in the work they’re doing

401
00:21:45.348 --> 00:21:47.432
to ensure that we get
a full investigation

402
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.432
to get to the bottom
of what has actually happened

403
00:21:49.432 --> 00:21:50.598
and how it came about.

404
00:21:50.598 --> 00:21:53.890
And obviously our thoughts go out to
all the family and friends of people

405
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.807
who have been affected by
such a tragic loss of life.

406
00:21:57.807 --> 00:22:01.098
It’s beyond words, to consider
what people are going through

407
00:22:01.098 --> 00:22:03.848
in that situation,
to make sure there is proper

408
00:22:03.848 --> 00:22:06.307
and respectful repatriation
of the remains of people

409
00:22:06.307 --> 00:22:08.890
to their home countries
and to their friends and families.

410
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.057
And do you think...
Coming back to Eric’s question.

411
00:22:11.057 --> 00:22:12.890
Ijust wanted to fill us in, Eric,
forgive me,

412
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.432
given that this just happened
before we came on air.

413
00:22:15.432 --> 00:22:18.265
Do you think the killing
of Qasem Soleimani

414
00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:20.765
has made the world a safer
or more dangerous place?

415
00:22:20.765 --> 00:22:22.348
Well, I think the reality is,

416
00:22:22.348 --> 00:22:24.223
particularly in
that part of the world...

417
00:22:24.223 --> 00:22:26.432
We have challenges
in parts the world,

418
00:22:26.432 --> 00:22:29.432
and that is a part of the world that
has been and is a dangerous place.

419
00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:32.765
We all want to see
a de—escalation of this situation.

420
00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:34.473
Globally, it is in
nobody’s interests

421
00:22:34.473 --> 00:22:36.390
to see anything other
than de—escalation.

422
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.265
We will be... As I say,
we want to work with our partners

423
00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:41.723
around making sure there’s
a good and proper investigation.

424
00:22:41.723 --> 00:22:43.598
We’re working with partners
around the world

425
00:22:43.598 --> 00:22:45.682
to make sure we do everything we ran
to play our part

426
00:22:45.682 --> 00:22:47.265
in seeing that de—escalation.

427
00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:50.348
The Prime Minister spoke to Rouhani
just this morning as well.

428
00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:52.390
But is it more dangerous now,
do you think?

429
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.390
I think we’re going to have to see
what happens over the next few days,

430
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.265
but this is a dangerous part
of the world,

431
00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:58.682
and we are in dangerous times.

432
00:22:58.682 --> 00:23:01.682
That’s why it’s important
that everybody is working together

433
00:23:01.682 --> 00:23:03.848
to see a de—escalation
of this situation.

434
00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:07.057
That’s what’s in the best interests
of all countries involved. Miatta?

435
00:23:07.057 --> 00:23:09.932
Yes, it has made it more dangerous.

436
00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:12.057
And, yes... Of course it has.

437
00:23:13.682 --> 00:23:17.390
Look, Soleimani
clearly terrorised people

438
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.765
in his own country and beyond.

439
00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.723
He clearly took action that was
destabilising in the region,

440
00:23:22.723 --> 00:23:25.223
but none of that excuses the action

441
00:23:25.223 --> 00:23:27.432
of the President
of the United States.

442
00:23:27.432 --> 00:23:32.432
You know, what Trump has done is the
thing that neither Bush or Obama...

443
00:23:32.432 --> 00:23:35.140
Theirjudgment was
it was the wrong thing to do,

444
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.473
to try to take out Soleimani,
because it would be highly risky

445
00:23:38.473 --> 00:23:42.223
that it would escalate things
and it would destabilise the region.

446
00:23:42.223 --> 00:23:44.432
And, you know,
you can’t help but feel

447
00:23:44.432 --> 00:23:48.307
that this is yet another example
of Trump being cavalier,

448
00:23:48.307 --> 00:23:52.307
reckless, thoughtless and impulsive,
and it’s put all of us in danger,

449
00:23:52.307 --> 00:23:55.723
and critically, it’s put people
in the Middle East in danger.

450
00:23:55.723 --> 00:24:00.640
And for me, you know, the scenes
of people in the streets in Iran

451
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.932
gives you the sense of the kind of
depth of feeling and anger,

452
00:24:04.932 --> 00:24:09.723
particularly against the backdrop
of, like, really crippling sanctions

453
00:24:09.723 --> 00:24:11.557
that the US has imposed on Iran,

454
00:24:11.557 --> 00:24:14.223
that means that there’s
food shortages in the country,

455
00:24:14.223 --> 00:24:16.307
medical shortages in the country.

456
00:24:16.307 --> 00:24:21.807
The IMF said that last year,
the Iranian economy shrunk by 9.5%.

457
00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:25.515
So people are angry and,
you know, Trump has done thejob

458
00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:28.640
of uniting the Iranian people
against America.

459
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.098
So it’s hugely dangerous. Not least
because, you know, for me,

460
00:24:32.098 --> 00:24:34.098
I can’t see
what the end goal is for him,

461
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:37.640
I can’t see what the strategy is,
and I don’t think there is one.

462
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.557
So I think for the UK Government,
you’ve got to play this

463
00:24:41.557 --> 00:24:44.515
and not hug the United States
closely on this.

464
00:24:44.515 --> 00:24:46.307
And, you know,
some of the kind of rhetoric

465
00:24:46.307 --> 00:24:47.765
that’s come from the Government —

466
00:24:47.765 --> 00:24:49.723
"We understand where
they’re coming from.

467
00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:52.515
"We’re on the same page as them" —
I think is a mistake.

468
00:24:52.515 --> 00:24:55.473
Because, you know, if you want
to play the role you say you do,

469
00:24:55.473 --> 00:24:58.348
of de—escalating,
if you want to play the role

470
00:24:58.348 --> 00:25:02.473
of trying to broker dialogue,
then the UK has to be seen

471
00:25:02.473 --> 00:25:05.973
and has to be strong
and independent of the US,

472
00:25:05.973 --> 00:25:09.973
and be willing to tell our closest
allies when they’re being reckless,

473
00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:11.723
that they ARE being reckless

474
00:25:11.723 --> 00:25:15.682
and putting at risk hundreds of
thousands of men, women and children

475
00:25:15.682 --> 00:25:19.557
in the Middle East, as well as
potentially people at home.

476
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.557
Just very briefly, Brandon,
as I’ve got you here,

477
00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:27.932
I’ll put you on the spot —
do you think it was reckless?

478
00:25:27.932 --> 00:25:30.765
I think the Americans have an
absolute right to defend themselves.

479
00:25:30.765 --> 00:25:33.140
We don’t know exactly what
the information was they had.

480
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.432
They made a decision.

481
00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.557
I know this is the Government line
that’s come out,

482
00:25:36.557 --> 00:25:39.765
but do you think it was reckless?
The reality is, this is a man who...

483
00:25:39.765 --> 00:25:43.182
It doesn’t excuse it.
You know, we don’t mourn his loss,

484
00:25:43.182 --> 00:25:46.182
but has been involved himself
in a huge amount of loss of life

485
00:25:46.182 --> 00:25:47.473
in that part of the world.

486
00:25:47.473 --> 00:25:49.807
And I think it is right
that we respect the fact

487
00:25:49.807 --> 00:25:52.265
that the United States has the right
to defend themselves,

488
00:25:52.265 --> 00:25:55.932
but our aim and our purpose is to
see a de—escalation in that region.

489
00:25:55.932 --> 00:25:58.057
Yes, the woman here in the front.

490
00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:03.473
Surely you wouldn’t have to worry
about changing... or de—escalating

491
00:26:03.473 --> 00:26:06.390
if we didn’t have a rogue president

492
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.265
going around doing these things
so recklessly,

493
00:26:09.265 --> 00:26:11.890
and just coming back to
the narrative around this,

494
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.557
whilst I’m not going to dispute
the wrongs that Soleimani did,

495
00:26:15.557 --> 00:26:21.515
he was also one of the leaders that
led the rebellions against Isis.

496
00:26:21.515 --> 00:26:26.723
So I think there’s a question mark
over just the recklessness

497
00:26:26.723 --> 00:26:28.890
with which this
has been carried out.

498
00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.057
0K. The woman at the back,
in the red top.

499
00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:34.932
My understanding is BorisJohnson
made this decision

500
00:26:34.932 --> 00:26:37.223
without informing you...
Oh, sorry, my apologies —

501
00:26:37.223 --> 00:26:38.932
that Donald Trump made this decision

502
00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:41.598
without informing you,
or BorisJohnson or Dominic Raab,

503
00:26:41.598 --> 00:26:43.182
that you were cut out of the loop

504
00:26:43.182 --> 00:26:45.348
in terms of this
major political change.

505
00:26:45.348 --> 00:26:48.598
So the British response has been
closer to the French and German one,

506
00:26:48.598 --> 00:26:50.682
to the point that we are criticised
by Mike Pompeo

507
00:26:50.682 --> 00:26:52.807
for not being as helpful
as we could be.

508
00:26:52.807 --> 00:26:55.015
It seems that we are
much closer aligned

509
00:26:55.015 --> 00:26:57.682
with France and Germany
and the EU response —

510
00:26:57.682 --> 00:26:59.848
how is this going to change
how you move forward

511
00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:01.932
in terms of making Brexit happen

512
00:27:01.932 --> 00:27:03.765
when one of our
close trading partners

513
00:27:03.765 --> 00:27:05.640
that we hope for in the future —
the Americans —

514
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.390
seem to be cutting us out of the
loop of major political decisions?

515
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.723
I’ll come back to you on that
in a moment, if I may, Brandon.

516
00:27:10.723 --> 00:27:13.348
Just there’s a lot of hands up.
Yes, the man in the brown sweater?

517
00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:16.515
So I think you briefly touched on
Britain’s role,

518
00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:19.390
so my kind of question
I’d be interested in hearing

519
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.723
to tie in with all this is,

520
00:27:20.723 --> 00:27:23.890
what do you see Britain’s role in
the Middle East is going forward?

521
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.015
What is your opinion
of our position?

522
00:27:27.015 --> 00:27:30.432
0K. And this man in another
brown sweater. Back there, yes.

523
00:27:30.432 --> 00:27:32.640
Would it help or hinder
the situation

524
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.723
if we follow Donald Trump’s advice

525
00:27:34.723 --> 00:27:38.848
and withdraw from
the Iran nuclear agreement?

526
00:27:38.848 --> 00:27:41.265
0K. Brandon, there’s a few things
you will need to answer.

527
00:27:41.265 --> 00:27:44.723
I’m going to go around the rest
of the panel first, if I may?

528
00:27:44.723 --> 00:27:48.765
(live. I think if you’re going
to have...

529
00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:53.432
..a society, a state
and an international community

530
00:27:53.432 --> 00:27:57.390
that’s going to live by the rule
of international law,

531
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.015
especially the laws
that you yourself

532
00:27:59.015 --> 00:28:03.098
have played a big part in writing,
then you need to stick by them.

533
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.057
And it looks to me that
at the moment,

534
00:28:06.057 --> 00:28:08.307
on the evidence
that hasn’t been supplied,

535
00:28:08.307 --> 00:28:13.182
this looks to me very much that this
is not abiding by international law.

536
00:28:13.182 --> 00:28:18.765
It’s actually looking very much
like a state—level assassination.

537
00:28:18.765 --> 00:28:20.348
APPLAUSE

538
00:28:20.348 --> 00:28:24.015
And can I ask you, given that you
saw active service in Afghanistan,

539
00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:26.890
what’s your view in terms of —
coming back to Eric’s question —

540
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.223
this killing making the world
a safer or more dangerous place?

541
00:28:30.223 --> 00:28:32.057
Well, I think you only have to...

542
00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:35.515
I think if you spoke to the families
and friends of the victims

543
00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:39.265
of that disaster that happened
to the aircraft,

544
00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:41.473
then I think you will
already have your answer.

545
00:28:41.473 --> 00:28:43.682
I don’t think we have to wait
and see, as Brandon says —

546
00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:44.973
we already have our answer.

547
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.307
The world is a more dangerous place
as a result of this.

548
00:28:47.307 --> 00:28:51.932
Let’s not forget, we’ve had
our own share of intervention

549
00:28:51.932 --> 00:28:54.015
in this part of the world,
in the Middle East.

550
00:28:54.015 --> 00:28:56.432
I know it’s Persia,
but this neck of the woods,

551
00:28:56.432 --> 00:28:58.765
and Iraq, which is
the next—door neighbour.

552
00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:01.932
I think if you look at the people
in Iraq and Iran,

553
00:29:01.932 --> 00:29:04.515
I was seeing thousands of people
on the street,

554
00:29:04.515 --> 00:29:06.807
pleading with their government,
pleading with Iran,

555
00:29:06.807 --> 00:29:09.723
pleading with the United States,
and after 20 years of war,

556
00:29:09.723 --> 00:29:12.932
of destabilisation, of hundreds
of thousands of people dead,

557
00:29:12.932 --> 00:29:15.390
in which our country
has played a part in the past,

558
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.598
along with the US and our allies,

559
00:29:17.598 --> 00:29:22.140
I think now to start to escalate
again and risk the threat of war...

560
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.973
Which is something,
if you’ve seen it up close,

561
00:29:24.973 --> 00:29:27.140
you would never wish on anyone.

562
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.057
There are generations in Iraq
who have been completely wiped out

563
00:29:31.057 --> 00:29:32.640
by what’s happened there.

564
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.265
And I think for Donald Trump
to act the way he has,

565
00:29:35.265 --> 00:29:39.057
to bring the Wild West
to the Middle East,

566
00:29:39.057 --> 00:29:42.890
then I think, ultimately,
we have a rogue president

567
00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:47.223
who is destabilising, I think,
global and international relations

568
00:29:47.223 --> 00:29:50.140
in an area which is
extremely dangerous,

569
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.807
just before he’s about to be
impeached, just before an election.

570
00:29:53.807 --> 00:29:55.765
It’s cynical, it looks wrong.

571
00:29:55.765 --> 00:29:57.432
And where is the Government?

572
00:29:57.432 --> 00:30:00.473
On the first political test
of foreign policy

573
00:30:00.473 --> 00:30:02.223
since they won the general election,

574
00:30:02.223 --> 00:30:04.348
and are now taking us
out of the European Union,

575
00:30:04.348 --> 00:30:06.598
they have fallen
at the first hurdle.

576
00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:09.348
Because ultimately,
what is happening here...

577
00:30:09.348 --> 00:30:12.807
We expected to see the British
Government and Boris Johnson

578
00:30:12.807 --> 00:30:15.432
come out and stand up
for the rule of law,

579
00:30:15.432 --> 00:30:18.140
and he has failed. We haven’t
even seen him in Parliament —

580
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.432
he’s still on the private island
of Mustique, as far as I know,

581
00:30:21.432 --> 00:30:23.890
texting his responses.
It’s completely unacceptable.

582
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.598
Other than, obviously,
being at Prime Minister’s Questions?

583
00:30:26.598 --> 00:30:29.890
Well, I know. Thought I’d get a
little joke in there about Mustique.

584
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.890
Well, just in case anyone
took you literally! Max?

585
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.348
The question I ask,

586
00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:38.265
what would we be saying if President
Putin had used a Russian drone

587
00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:40.765
to take out a Western client
in this way?

588
00:30:40.765 --> 00:30:44.432
I think opinion would be deeply...
APPLAUSE

589
00:30:45.765 --> 00:30:48.057
I wouldn’t use the rhetoric
that Clive has used,

590
00:30:48.057 --> 00:30:50.140
but I don’t disagree
with the fundamental.

591
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.682
Yes, it has made the world
a more dangerous place.

592
00:30:52.682 --> 00:30:56.265
There is no...
I read American media every day

593
00:30:56.265 --> 00:30:59.140
and I haven’t seen,
anywhere in the American media,

594
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.390
any suggestion there is any strategy
or any policy behind this.

595
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.557
This was just a lunge
by the President,

596
00:31:05.557 --> 00:31:09.848
and where I totally agree
with Miatta and with Clive —

597
00:31:09.848 --> 00:31:12.348
I don’t think you can expect
a British Prime Minister

598
00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:15.140
to make anything other than
sympathetic or respectful noises

599
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.432
to the United States
in the House of Commons,

600
00:31:18.432 --> 00:31:20.223
as BorisJohnson did yesterday.

601
00:31:20.223 --> 00:31:23.057
But I think it will be a key test,

602
00:31:23.057 --> 00:31:26.723
if we get a new escalation
of the Iran situation,

603
00:31:26.723 --> 00:31:29.057
which is highly likely
in the months ahead,

604
00:31:29.057 --> 00:31:32.432
and if President Trump seems
determined to pursue this course,

605
00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:36.223
I think it is vital
BorisJohnson displays the courage

606
00:31:36.223 --> 00:31:40.765
to say that we will have no part of
direct military action against Iran.

607
00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:43.515
And I think that will be
a vital test for this government.

608
00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:51.432
We’ve seen enough. We are all deeply
scorched about the memory of 2003,

609
00:31:51.432 --> 00:31:54.890
everything that is happening
in Iraq today derived from that,

610
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.390
and any suggestion
that we should now get involved

611
00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.973
in direct military action,
just to keep the...

612
00:31:59.973 --> 00:32:02.515
First of all, the Americans...

613
00:32:02.515 --> 00:32:05.223
So many British Prime Ministers
since 1941

614
00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:08.307
have done things in hopes of payback
from the Americans.

615
00:32:08.307 --> 00:32:11.932
We have a good working relationship
with the United States

616
00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:15.140
on many issues,
but there is never any payback

617
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.640
for our support for them.
But again and again,

618
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.473
we’ve been weak enough to support

619
00:32:19.473 --> 00:32:24.265
mistaken American
foreign policy initiatives

620
00:32:24.265 --> 00:32:26.598
and we’ve got absolutely nothing
out of it,

621
00:32:26.598 --> 00:32:29.390
and this is a good moment
to say, "No more."

622
00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.098
APPLAUSE

623
00:32:31.098 --> 00:32:33.307
Anne?

624
00:32:33.307 --> 00:32:34.515
I’m just slightly staggered

625
00:32:34.515 --> 00:32:39.223
to find that Max Hastings has turned
into a sort ofJeremy Corbyn!

626
00:32:39.223 --> 00:32:41.223
No—one more surprised
than Max, I suspect.

627
00:32:41.223 --> 00:32:42.432
LAUGHTER

628
00:32:42.432 --> 00:32:45.140
Well, that speech could have come
from that direction.

629
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.890
The one thing I think
is a bit missing so far,

630
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.515
so I’m going to focus in on it —

631
00:32:49.515 --> 00:32:52.390
everyone sort of gave the General
Soleimani and the Iranian position

632
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.473
a bit of a free pass.
I think it’s very hard,

633
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:58.932
because President Trump
makes it very hard to say,

634
00:32:58.932 --> 00:33:02.265
"Here is someone we ran rely on
to keep us safe."

635
00:33:02.265 --> 00:33:04.515
That was the question.

636
00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:08.598
Yes, we know he’s reckless.
Yes, we know that it is hard to find

637
00:33:08.598 --> 00:33:12.307
a strategic way through
Donald Trump’s thinking.

638
00:33:12.307 --> 00:33:15.182
But our interests, America’s
interests, the West’s interests

639
00:33:15.182 --> 00:33:18.473
also will go on
long after Donald Trump.

640
00:33:18.473 --> 00:33:21.682
And one of the things I think
we’ve gone past rather fast

641
00:33:21.682 --> 00:33:23.932
is we would need some response

642
00:33:23.932 --> 00:33:27.057
to what had become a spiral of
aggression across the Middle East

643
00:33:27.057 --> 00:33:30.682
from Iran, sponsored by the likes of
General Soleimani,

644
00:33:30.682 --> 00:33:32.723
and very largely by him.

645
00:33:32.723 --> 00:33:34.557
This was not something
that started...

646
00:33:34.557 --> 00:33:37.140
I think the lady
in front mentioned Iraq.

647
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.723
It goes back way before Iraq —

648
00:33:38.723 --> 00:33:41.765
it goes back to 1979
and the aftermath of that,

649
00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:46.265
and a strong Islamist Shia push
to make "many Irans",

650
00:33:46.265 --> 00:33:49.723
as I think the rhetoric is
from that quarter in Tehran.

651
00:33:49.723 --> 00:33:52.390
I’ve been very pleased to see
that the response...

652
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.098
There are other forces in Tehran
who I think want to balance it out.

653
00:33:55.098 --> 00:33:58.182
But I don’t think it was just going
to go on without any response.

654
00:33:58.182 --> 00:34:00.390
Clive goes the legal route —

655
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.098
it’s a perfectly decent
and correct question,

656
00:34:03.098 --> 00:34:05.807
but it’s not the only question
in international affairs.

657
00:34:05.807 --> 00:34:09.098
It’s not the only question if you
want to keep your own country safe

658
00:34:09.098 --> 00:34:12.057
and keep a global order,
which is incredibly difficult

659
00:34:12.057 --> 00:34:13.682
and changeable and risky.

660
00:34:13.682 --> 00:34:16.723
And it is like that
with and without Donald Trump.

661
00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:18.682
What I’d like to see,
of course, from us,

662
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:20.473
seeing as we’re sitting here
in Britain...

663
00:34:20.473 --> 00:34:22.473
You asked what the British response
would be.

664
00:34:22.473 --> 00:34:24.473
I can tell you,
from my personal knowledge,

665
00:34:24.473 --> 00:34:27.182
that many senior Americans,
including some in uniform,

666
00:34:27.182 --> 00:34:29.307
are as appalled
by the President’s handling

667
00:34:29.307 --> 00:34:32.307
of foreign policy
and military affairs as we are.

668
00:34:32.307 --> 00:34:34.515
I don’t dispute that
for a moment, Max.

669
00:34:34.515 --> 00:34:36.140
There was a very senior American

670
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.807
who telephoned
a very senior British official,

671
00:34:39.807 --> 00:34:42.140
just after he left
the Trump administration.

672
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.057
He was one of the most senior former
members of the Trump administration,

673
00:34:45.057 --> 00:34:47.057
And he told his British friend,

674
00:34:47.057 --> 00:34:49.932
"I owe you this call
because we work closely together,

675
00:34:49.932 --> 00:34:52.973
"and I want to tell you
that you should be in no doubt,

676
00:34:52.973 --> 00:34:55.182
"however many state visits you do,

677
00:34:55.182 --> 00:34:58.182
"however often you have Trump
to Buckingham Palace,

678
00:34:58.182 --> 00:35:01.265
"this this American government
does not do allies,

679
00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:03.140
"it does not do partners.

680
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.182
"Expect nothing
from this administration."

681
00:35:05.182 --> 00:35:06.932
And this is where we are.

682
00:35:06.932 --> 00:35:08.932
Well, I don’t think
you’re right about that.

683
00:35:08.932 --> 00:35:10.182
I think you pursue...

684
00:35:10.182 --> 00:35:12.932
You ask... Very good questions from
the audience — what should we do?

685
00:35:12.932 --> 00:35:14.723
We pursue de—escalation,

686
00:35:14.723 --> 00:35:17.807
we stay close to our more robust
European allies,

687
00:35:17.807 --> 00:35:21.015
who I think also know there is also
a major problem about Iran,

688
00:35:21.015 --> 00:35:24.057
there is not only a major problem
with Donald Trump.

689
00:35:24.057 --> 00:35:27.432
And no, you don’t get involved
in anything like...

690
00:35:27.432 --> 00:35:29.890
You know, we’ve talked about
a military intervention,

691
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.015
side—saddled with the US.
No, I would not support that either.

692
00:35:33.015 --> 00:35:35.807
You calibrate your response.
But you don’tjust go around saying,

693
00:35:35.807 --> 00:35:38.807
"This is another example of a mad US
president doing another mad thing."

694
00:35:38.807 --> 00:35:40.057
It’s not enough,

695
00:35:40.057 --> 00:35:43.015
and it won’t see you through
the next few difficult years

696
00:35:43.015 --> 00:35:45.432
and the really difficult choices
that lie ahead of us.

697
00:35:45.432 --> 00:35:48.098
0K. There’s a lot of people sitting
patiently with their hands up.

698
00:35:48.098 --> 00:35:49.765
Yes, the woman
in the blue scarf there.

699
00:35:49.765 --> 00:35:51.057
Yes, I agree with Anne,

700
00:35:51.057 --> 00:35:54.057
because I think that we might be
misleading ourselves

701
00:35:54.057 --> 00:35:56.473
to say that Trump
isjust a rogue president

702
00:35:56.473 --> 00:36:00.432
when, in fact, he probably has
quite a bit of backing in the US.

703
00:36:00.432 --> 00:36:04.223
There are quite a few Americans
who really support his actions.

704
00:36:04.223 --> 00:36:07.182
I’m not as well—connected
as Max, obviously,

705
00:36:07.182 --> 00:36:09.765
but I think it strikes me
that we often like to look

706
00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:11.348
at the people who support us

707
00:36:11.348 --> 00:36:13.640
and say, "Oh, they disagree
and he’s rogue,"

708
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.515
but, in fact, is he rogue?
Is he not accepting advice?

709
00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:18.557
I don’t agree
with his actions myself,

710
00:36:18.557 --> 00:36:20.640
but I think we might
mislead ourselves

711
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.973
to continue to call him this rogue
president acting on his own.

712
00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:25.432
Brandon, let’s come back to you,

713
00:36:25.432 --> 00:36:28.473
cos there were a number of points
raised that only you can answer,

714
00:36:28.473 --> 00:36:32.515
and one in particular about
Britain’s relationship with America,

715
00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:35.265
and how much Britain calibrates
its support of actions like this

716
00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:37.640
in the hope of getting a trade deal,
or whatever it might be.

717
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.515
And then of course we heard what
Max had to say,

718
00:36:39.515 --> 00:36:41.223
which is, you know,
that’s for the birds.

719
00:36:41.223 --> 00:36:43.015
Well, look, turning
to the lady’s point...

720
00:36:43.015 --> 00:36:45.515
I can’t remember if it was
the lady or one of the gentlemen

721
00:36:45.515 --> 00:36:47.765
that made the point about
the Iran nuclear agreement.

722
00:36:47.765 --> 00:36:49.807
Our position is, as I said,
this is a...

723
00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.723
You know, we do live
in dangerous times,

724
00:36:51.723 --> 00:36:53.682
this is a dangerous part
of the world —

725
00:36:53.682 --> 00:36:55.848
that’s why we want to see
de—escalation,

726
00:36:55.848 --> 00:36:59.682
we want to see the parties
fulfilling that nuclear agreement —

727
00:36:59.682 --> 00:37:02.807
the Iranian deal,
as it’s commonly called.

728
00:37:02.807 --> 00:37:06.348
In terms of the lady’s point
specifically about our partners,

729
00:37:06.348 --> 00:37:08.015
I think this is actually...

730
00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:10.473
And I have to say, if we were going
to get onto Brexit,

731
00:37:10.473 --> 00:37:13.223
I didn’t expect to do it
in the context of THIS question.

732
00:37:13.223 --> 00:37:17.223
You never know what’s going to
happen on Question Time! Absolutely.

733
00:37:17.223 --> 00:37:19.973
On a serious note,
I think this is actually a...

734
00:37:19.973 --> 00:37:23.265
What you have outlined
is a very good example of the point

735
00:37:23.265 --> 00:37:25.182
that I think is quite important
to remember —

736
00:37:25.182 --> 00:37:27.432
that we are leaving the EU,
we are not leaving Europe.

737
00:37:27.432 --> 00:37:29.265
We want to be an important partner

738
00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:31.432
and friend with countries
that we work closely with.

739
00:37:31.432 --> 00:37:33.307
The Prime Minister,
as I said earlier on,

740
00:37:33.307 --> 00:37:34.765
has spoken to President Macron

741
00:37:34.765 --> 00:37:37.765
and to Angela Merkel,
the Chancellor, already.

742
00:37:37.765 --> 00:37:39.140
We want to work with them,

743
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.890
playing our part in de—escalating
this, and that response.

744
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.015
That doesn’t preclude us
from doing a very good trade deal,

745
00:37:45.015 --> 00:37:47.682
either with them as part of the EU,

746
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:49.973
or with our friends and partners
in the United States.

747
00:37:49.973 --> 00:37:52.640
The special relationship
between our countries

748
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.598
has always gone well beyond
a relationship

749
00:37:54.598 --> 00:37:56.432
between a prime minister
and a president.

750
00:37:56.432 --> 00:37:59.140
It’s a relationship built
on security and history as well.

751
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.432
and I do believe, actually,
that we can do a trade deal

752
00:38:01.432 --> 00:38:03.515
with the United States.
And I know that they are. ..

753
00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:06.223
Donald Trump has thrown some
cold water over that,

754
00:38:06.223 --> 00:38:08.765
saying the withdrawal agreement
at the moment

755
00:38:08.765 --> 00:38:11.015
is precluding a trade deal
with America.

756
00:38:11.015 --> 00:38:12.807
I have talked to people
in Washington

757
00:38:12.807 --> 00:38:14.682
with the Trade Department recently.

758
00:38:14.682 --> 00:38:17.973
Liz Truss, the Secretary of State,
has spoken to her counterparts

759
00:38:17.973 --> 00:38:21.140
regularly and recently and they are
keen to do a trade deal with us

760
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.182
and I think that’s in
the best interests

761
00:38:23.182 --> 00:38:24.932
of the economy of both
our countries,

762
00:38:24.932 --> 00:38:27.807
as well as doing a trade deal with
friends and partners in the EU.

763
00:38:27.807 --> 00:38:30.057
I don’t think one precludes
the other.

764
00:38:30.057 --> 00:38:31.765
We want to see both happen. 0K.

765
00:38:31.765 --> 00:38:34.598
We have a number of other
questions to get through.

766
00:38:34.598 --> 00:38:38.015
Before I move on, I want to
tell you that next week

767
00:38:38.015 --> 00:38:40.265
we will be in Liverpool

768
00:38:40.265 --> 00:38:42.223
and the week after that
we are in Stoke Newington

769
00:38:42.223 --> 00:38:43.890
in north—east London.

770
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:47.057
If you want to be in the audience,
you ran all us

771
00:38:47.057 --> 00:38:50.932
or go to the Question Time website
and follow the instructions

772
00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:52.765
and join the conversation.

773
00:38:52.765 --> 00:38:57.098
Let’s move on to Rochelle Silva.

774
00:38:57.098 --> 00:39:02.307
Should the Labour Party
make a clean breakfrom Corbynism?

775
00:39:02.307 --> 00:39:04.432
APPLAUSE

776
00:39:06.473 --> 00:39:10.265
Clive Lewis, I will come to you
in a minute. I’ll start with Miatta.

777
00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.973
0K!

778
00:39:11.973 --> 00:39:15.973
Look, I don’t think you can
experience a defeat

779
00:39:15.973 --> 00:39:19.640
of the size the Labour Party did
in December

780
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.432
and not change, and not do things
differently,

781
00:39:23.432 --> 00:39:27.265
and just continue doing what
you are doing and hope for the best.

782
00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:30.015
So, I think the labour Party needs
to reach out,

783
00:39:30.015 --> 00:39:32.348
notjust to its
traditional heartlands,

784
00:39:32.348 --> 00:39:34.515
but beyond that and speak to people.

785
00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:37.015
To understand why people
moved away from it —

786
00:39:37.015 --> 00:39:40.432
in this election, but also
in the last three or four elections,

787
00:39:40.432 --> 00:39:43.723
because this is a longer term
problem for the Labour Party.

788
00:39:43.723 --> 00:39:47.223
And based on that, decide what
the change looks like.

789
00:39:47.223 --> 00:39:48.807
The thing I would say,

790
00:39:48.807 --> 00:39:51.640
I think one of the things
Labour got right

791
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.723
was to say, to look at the country,

792
00:39:53.723 --> 00:39:56.682
look at the scale of some of
the challenges we face —

793
00:39:56.682 --> 00:39:58.640
so the climate emergency,

794
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.015
the fact our economy is not working
for everyone.

795
00:40:02.015 --> 00:40:06.057
We have had a decade where living
standards have been squeezed,

796
00:40:06.057 --> 00:40:09.932
so people today are no better off
than they were ten years ago.

797
00:40:09.932 --> 00:40:12.598
That is unprecedented
in modern times.

798
00:40:12.598 --> 00:40:16.973
To see the crisis in our public
services and say enough is enough.

799
00:40:16.973 --> 00:40:19.557
We need to do something different.

800
00:40:19.557 --> 00:40:23.973
We need ambitious, bold policies
to transform the economy.

801
00:40:23.973 --> 00:40:26.557
My plea to all the leadership
contenders is,

802
00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:29.348
don’t retreat from that ground.

803
00:40:29.348 --> 00:40:34.390
The job is to deliver an ambitious
prospectus for change,

804
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.432
but a clear plan,

805
00:40:36.432 --> 00:40:38.890
and to convince the country you have
a plan to deliver that.

806
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.765
I think in doing that... But have
you answered the question, Miatta?

807
00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:45.307
Should the Labour Party
make a clean breakfrom Corbynism?

808
00:40:45.307 --> 00:40:46.848
I’m not sure what your answer is.

809
00:40:46.848 --> 00:40:49.890
I don’t really know what
Corbynism is, quite frankly.

810
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.598
What I think what they need to do

811
00:40:51.598 --> 00:40:55.348
is develop an ambitious prospectus,
but learn some of the lessons.

812
00:40:55.348 --> 00:40:57.848
So what did we see in this election?

813
00:40:57.848 --> 00:41:01.598
The manifesto was overloaded,
they promised too much.

814
00:41:01.598 --> 00:41:05.265
Within it, they crammed in 310—15
year programme of government

815
00:41:05.265 --> 00:41:08.640
into five years, and people did not
believe it could be delivered.

816
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.057
They tried to do everything
through national government,

817
00:41:12.057 --> 00:41:15.432
and there was a big gap in
the manifesto around devolution

818
00:41:15.432 --> 00:41:20.098
and a radical plan to push power
out of Westminster and Whitehall.

819
00:41:20.098 --> 00:41:24.098
Because you only deliver change
if you give people power and control

820
00:41:24.098 --> 00:41:27.807
to make that change happen in the
places where they live and work.

821
00:41:27.807 --> 00:41:29.723
Instead of talking about socialism,

822
00:41:29.723 --> 00:41:32.140
which, quite frankly, for a lot of
people out there,

823
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.473
it doesn’t mean anything, set out
a vision for the type of country

824
00:41:35.473 --> 00:41:38.307
you are trying to create.
Set out a vision that says,

825
00:41:38.307 --> 00:41:40.432
"We don’t think we should have
an economy

826
00:41:40.432 --> 00:41:44.390
"where the minority of people
do disproportionately better,

827
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.182
"and huge swathes of people
are left behind,"

828
00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:50.057
you know, an economy where
one in three of our children

829
00:41:50.057 --> 00:41:51.390
are living in poverty,

830
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.015
one in which we don’t protect
our environment,

831
00:41:54.015 --> 00:41:56.807
and you say instead,
"Let’s club together,

832
00:41:56.807 --> 00:41:59.932
"let’s provide services that will
look after us when we are

833
00:41:59.932 --> 00:42:01.557
"ill and old, like our NHS,

834
00:42:01.557 --> 00:42:04.390
"that will look after
and educate our children."

835
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.182
But didn’t millions of voters
reject a Marxist prospectus?

836
00:42:08.182 --> 00:42:11.307
Well, I don’t believe it was
a Marxist prospectus.

837
00:42:11.307 --> 00:42:13.057
At no point in the election

838
00:42:13.057 --> 00:42:16.390
did we talk about the country
or economy we wanted.

839
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:20.348
We talked about getting Brexit done,
the NHS and trade deals.

840
00:42:20.348 --> 00:42:22.432
I think there was a job absolutely

841
00:42:22.432 --> 00:42:25.682
to respond to some of
the challenges the country faces,

842
00:42:25.682 --> 00:42:28.098
but you have to do it in terms
people care about,

843
00:42:28.098 --> 00:42:30.640
that they understand
and relate to their life,

844
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.223
and that’s what the Labour Party
needs to do.

845
00:42:33.223 --> 00:42:35.807
Most of my life...
APPLAUSE

846
00:42:37.223 --> 00:42:40.348
Most of my life I have been
a left of centre Tory,

847
00:42:40.348 --> 00:42:43.390
a Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine
type Tory -

848
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:47.015
but I voted for Tony Blair
in ‘97 and 2002,

849
00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:48.890
and I only turned away
from the Labour Party

850
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.723
when he went mad and invaded Iraq.

851
00:42:51.723 --> 00:42:54.598
In that sense I am the sort of voter

852
00:42:54.598 --> 00:42:56.848
whom a lot of people in
the Labour Party don’t went back,

853
00:42:56.848 --> 00:42:59.348
because you don’t see
any place for us.

854
00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:01.765
50 millions of us are
disenfranchised

855
00:43:01.765 --> 00:43:03.848
out there in the middle of politics.

856
00:43:03.848 --> 00:43:07.515
Tony Blair was a pretty good Prime
Minister until he invaded Iraq,

857
00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:09.807
and he did a lot of good things
for Britain.

858
00:43:09.807 --> 00:43:13.015
If we get another Labour leader
remotely resembling —

859
00:43:13.015 --> 00:43:16.432
and who, for me, means Keir Starmer,
I, for one, will vote for him.

860
00:43:16.432 --> 00:43:18.515
APPLAUSE

861
00:43:18.515 --> 00:43:21.098
The man in the dark suit.

862
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.432
I happen to agree
with what Max has just said.

863
00:43:24.432 --> 00:43:25.890
Miatta, reality is,

864
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.932
Labour lost because they had
a totally unelectable leader,

865
00:43:29.932 --> 00:43:32.598
a front bench that was just
not good enough

866
00:43:32.598 --> 00:43:35.307
and a manifesto that
lacked credibility.

867
00:43:35.307 --> 00:43:37.307
The sooner the party
understands that

868
00:43:37.307 --> 00:43:41.765
and recognises that by winning three
general elections from the centre,

869
00:43:41.765 --> 00:43:44.890
that’s how you win power
and then do things you want to do,

870
00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.723
you will never get back in.

871
00:43:46.723 --> 00:43:49.848
It will be ten years before we get
near a Labour government again.

872
00:43:49.848 --> 00:43:51.098
APPLAUSE

873
00:43:51.098 --> 00:43:53.598
Is that what you will try to do,
(live?

874
00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:57.390
I noticed after Rebecca Long—Bailey
gave Jeremy Corbyn

875
00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.432
ten out of ten,
you gave him six out of ten.

876
00:44:00.432 --> 00:44:02.265
Which is still pretty high,

877
00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:04.932
given it was the worst Labour defeat
since 1935.

878
00:44:04.932 --> 00:44:07.640
Is Corbynism finished,
as far as you are concerned?

879
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.182
Would you go more to the centre,
as the man suggested?

880
00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:14.307
The key thing to understand about
the centre of British politics

881
00:44:14.307 --> 00:44:16.515
is that the centre
of politics shifts.

882
00:44:16.515 --> 00:44:20.140
One of the thingsJeremy Corbyn
and the last Labour leadership

883
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.015
got right was that they understood,

884
00:44:22.015 --> 00:44:24.723
although they may not
have been able to deliver it,

885
00:44:24.723 --> 00:44:27.348
is that there is a large number
of people in this country

886
00:44:27.348 --> 00:44:30.098
who are ashamed at the levels
of inequality in the country,

887
00:44:30.098 --> 00:44:32.932
notjust in terms of income,
but also wealth,

888
00:44:32.932 --> 00:44:35.098
and there are people
deeply concerned

889
00:44:35.098 --> 00:44:37.848
about issues like
the impending climate crisis,

890
00:44:37.848 --> 00:44:41.265
for which we have a government
who are missing in action.

891
00:44:41.265 --> 00:44:45.390
There are things here where we will
find consensus across this country,

892
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.890
with people like Max,
where we understand

893
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.307
we need to make some radical changes
to how this country,

894
00:44:51.307 --> 00:44:54.932
how our economy operates, because
we are facing an existential crisis,

895
00:44:54.932 --> 00:44:58.098
notjust from the climate,
but also of democracy.

896
00:44:58.098 --> 00:45:00.890
I think if you want to
understand why Labour lost,

897
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:04.140
there are seeds of truth
in what people said tonight.

898
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.932
How do you win someone
like Max back?

899
00:45:05.932 --> 00:45:08.723
Winning someone like Max back, you
have to put forward a prospectus

900
00:45:08.723 --> 00:45:11.932
which actually say, and the Labour
Party does... He’s right here.

901
00:45:11.932 --> 00:45:15.765
You can pitch to him now.
I want... Let’s get you back, Max.

902
00:45:15.765 --> 00:45:18.473
I want Max’s vote
for the Labour Party

903
00:45:18.473 --> 00:45:21.723
because ultimately, unless
the Labour Party can appeal

904
00:45:21.723 --> 00:45:24.140
to the centre ground
of British politics,

905
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.057
then you are right, it can’t win.

906
00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:28.765
But the centre ground
changes and shifts.

907
00:45:28.765 --> 00:45:31.932
So if we are talking about
democratising the economy

908
00:45:31.932 --> 00:45:35.557
and giving ourselves a sense of
ownership and agency in our lives,

909
00:45:35.557 --> 00:45:38.140
and these are not things that are
necessarily just socialist,

910
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.973
these are things we all want
in our lives.

911
00:45:39.973 --> 00:45:42.390
If we we nt to have a world
our children can inherit,

912
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:44.140
where they can breathe clean air,

913
00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.390
where we have a national
health care system

914
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.057
where you don’t have 4.4 million
people on the waiting list,

915
00:45:49.057 --> 00:45:52.223
these are things where the centre
ground of British politics is there.

916
00:45:52.223 --> 00:45:54.223
That’s not a mad socialist
perspective,

917
00:45:54.223 --> 00:45:57.098
and it’s the job of the Labour Party
to be able to represent that

918
00:45:57.098 --> 00:46:01.015
in a way that is cooperative and
a way in which people can buy into.

919
00:46:01.015 --> 00:46:05.348
Now, I understand what has happened
in some of the seats we lost —

920
00:46:05.348 --> 00:46:08.640
I would say that has been 40 years
in the making.

921
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.140
If you look at the number
of votes we have lost,

922
00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.390
millions of votes over the last
40 years.

923
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:18.723
We as a party did so many good
things between 1997 and 2010,

924
00:46:18.723 --> 00:46:21.973
but we also need to understand
we got some things wrong.

925
00:46:21.973 --> 00:46:24.432
If we want to reach out back
to those communities

926
00:46:24.432 --> 00:46:27.348
and also hold on to the seats
we have got and build some more,

927
00:46:27.348 --> 00:46:29.432
we have to understand
that the Labour Party

928
00:46:29.432 --> 00:46:31.848
will not be dictating to people
in the 2lst century,

929
00:46:31.848 --> 00:46:34.390
it has to talk about the language
of collaboration.

930
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.890
That’s why I have been talking
about the fact

931
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:38.890
that if this is to be
a five year project,

932
00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.515
we have to start talking
about collaborating

933
00:46:42.515 --> 00:46:44.640
with other political parties
and movements.

934
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.057
The world isn’t going to wait...

935
00:46:46.057 --> 00:46:48.807
Is that because you think you can’t
be popular enough on your own? No.

936
00:46:48.807 --> 00:46:49.890
I’ll tell you why.

937
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.015
Ultimately, if you look at what’s
happened to Scotland, for example,

938
00:46:53.015 --> 00:46:55.682
80% of the seats there
are controlled by the SNP.

939
00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:58.140
My constituents can’t wait
for a ten year project

940
00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.765
to come back into power.
It has to be in five.

941
00:47:00.765 --> 00:47:03.973
Why is the SNP is so powerful?
Because politicians in Westminster

942
00:47:03.973 --> 00:47:06.015
have not been listening
to the Scottish people.

943
00:47:06.015 --> 00:47:07.432
That’s what’s been happening.

944
00:47:07.432 --> 00:47:09.182
We have to listen
to the Scottish people.

945
00:47:09.182 --> 00:47:12.932
If that means we have to work with
the SNP to get rid of the Tories

946
00:47:12.932 --> 00:47:16.640
and bring in radical constitutional
reform in this country

947
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.223
so that we have a voting system
fit for purpose,

948
00:47:19.223 --> 00:47:22.848
where we have a democracy where
Zac Goldsmith loses his seat one day

949
00:47:22.848 --> 00:47:24.348
when the electorate don’t want him

950
00:47:24.348 --> 00:47:26.015
and ends up back in the samejob
a week later

951
00:47:26.015 --> 00:47:27.848
when BorisJohnson appoints him —

952
00:47:27.848 --> 00:47:30.765
that’s wrong, and it’s not
a democracy I want to live in.

953
00:47:30.765 --> 00:47:32.682
APPLAUSE
Lots of hands up.

954
00:47:32.682 --> 00:47:34.515
The woman in the green sweater
in the back.

955
00:47:36.098 --> 00:47:38.223
People seem to think Meghan Markle

956
00:47:38.223 --> 00:47:40.557
was harassed and hounded
by the press —

957
00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:45.140
that wasn’t a millionth of a scratch
of the relentless campaign

958
00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.015
aboutJeremy Corbyn
from the moment he stood

959
00:47:48.015 --> 00:47:51.807
and was leader of the Labour Party,

960
00:47:51.807 --> 00:47:56.390
by a right wing press
owned by multimillionaires,

961
00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:00.682
billionaire people,
most of whom are tax exiles,

962
00:48:00.682 --> 00:48:03.390
who don’t even live in this country.

963
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.348
And the truth is, I think
you can argue all you want

964
00:48:06.348 --> 00:48:08.932
about who is the leader
of the Labour Party,

965
00:48:08.932 --> 00:48:13.932
anyone standing for socialism
will receive the same thing,

966
00:48:13.932 --> 00:48:17.307
and combined with the techniques
used by Cambridge Analytica,

967
00:48:17.307 --> 00:48:19.848
will not stand a chance —

968
00:48:19.848 --> 00:48:23.348
they will not let a socialist
be elected in this country.

969
00:48:23.348 --> 00:48:25.640
0K. The man in the tie, there.

970
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.973
I think the fact we are having
this conversation again —

971
00:48:28.973 --> 00:48:30.348
with the leadership election

972
00:48:30.348 --> 00:48:32.432
afterJeremy Corbyn
was elected the first time,

973
00:48:32.432 --> 00:48:33.848
you talk about collaboration,

974
00:48:33.848 --> 00:48:36.807
I have seen no collaboration
within the Labour Party,

975
00:48:36.807 --> 00:48:39.890
and the fact you guys couldn’t get
together throughout the last decade

976
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.140
has really caused a place where we
haven’t had a strong opposition

977
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.682
in this country for some time.

978
00:48:44.682 --> 00:48:48.182
What I ask of the Labour Party is,
can you unite together now

979
00:48:48.182 --> 00:48:51.182
going forward and become
that strong opposition?

980
00:48:51.182 --> 00:48:53.682
The woman with the glasses.

981
00:48:53.682 --> 00:48:56.807
I believe, to get democracy
really right,

982
00:48:56.807 --> 00:49:01.473
we have to get rid of
the first past the post system

983
00:49:01.473 --> 00:49:02.807
we have at the moment.

984
00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:06.140
The Labour Party didn’t do
half as bad as everybody says,

985
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.307
in terms of votes.
It was just in terms of seats.

986
00:49:09.307 --> 00:49:11.848
I find that incredibly unfair,

987
00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:16.307
that the Conservative Party
has such a massive majority

988
00:49:16.307 --> 00:49:18.723
on only like 43% of the votes.

989
00:49:18.723 --> 00:49:20.682
APPLAUSE

990
00:49:20.682 --> 00:49:23.265
Let’s hear more from the audience —

991
00:49:23.265 --> 00:49:26.265
the woman on the edge, there,
in the sweater.

992
00:49:27.557 --> 00:49:29.640
Ijust wanted to know —
this is for Clive —

993
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.765
if you really think it was
a failure of policy

994
00:49:31.765 --> 00:49:33.432
or a failure of leadership,

995
00:49:33.432 --> 00:49:37.515
and what you would potentially bring
to the Labour leadership role?

996
00:49:37.515 --> 00:49:40.348
Reasonably briefly, because I’ve
given you quite a big shout here.

997
00:49:40.348 --> 00:49:43.348
I think it’s possible
to say it was both.

998
00:49:43.348 --> 00:49:46.765
In terms of the policies,
Miatta touched on it,

999
00:49:46.765 --> 00:49:49.890
it was one of the most
radical manifestos.

1000
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.473
If I took any individual item,

1001
00:49:51.473 --> 00:49:53.265
I would say there was
a good argument

1002
00:49:53.265 --> 00:49:55.098
for most of those policies in there,

1003
00:49:55.098 --> 00:49:58.765
but if you will drop such a radical
manifesto onto the electorate

1004
00:49:58.765 --> 00:50:01.890
over a six—week period, you will
have problems, and we did.

1005
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:03.765
There were issues of leadership —

1006
00:50:03.765 --> 00:50:06.973
the issue of anti—Semitism
was an issue,

1007
00:50:06.973 --> 00:50:09.807
and people don’t think strong
leadership was shown on that.

1008
00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:12.140
And also on Brexit,
whichever way wejumped,

1009
00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.390
we should have jumped
one way or the other.

1010
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.223
In the end, we ended up with our
feet going in opposite directions.

1011
00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:20.015
There are seeds of truth
in all those arguments,

1012
00:50:20.015 --> 00:50:23.390
but ultimately, if we want to
bring this party back together,

1013
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.723
I will come to the point the lady
mentioned just then,

1014
00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:28.848
we have to think about
how we will collaborate with others.

1015
00:50:28.848 --> 00:50:31.432
The Conservative Party did this,

1016
00:50:31.432 --> 00:50:33.182
they did a deal with
the Brexit Party.

1017
00:50:33.182 --> 00:50:35.223
What did we do? We didn’t do a deal
with the Greens,

1018
00:50:35.223 --> 00:50:37.807
the Liberal Democrats and others,
and we paid the price for that.

1019
00:50:37.807 --> 00:50:39.223
Anne.

1020
00:50:39.223 --> 00:50:41.390
APPLAUSE

1021
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.390
I come from the North East, the
newly Tory North East of England.

1022
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.598
I have several grandparents
revolving in their graves.

1023
00:50:47.598 --> 00:50:50.057
That’s a good example —
there’s a part of the country,

1024
00:50:50.057 --> 00:50:53.348
particularly the constituencies
near where I’m from,

1025
00:50:53.348 --> 00:50:55.848
North West Durham,
the Bishop Aucklands, etc,

1026
00:50:55.848 --> 00:50:59.307
where these were never supposed to
leave the grip of the Labour Party —

1027
00:50:59.307 --> 00:51:00.640
and they did.

1028
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.473
While I think Clive
is absolutely right,

1029
00:51:02.473 --> 00:51:04.598
and he is more open
than many of his colleagues

1030
00:51:04.598 --> 00:51:08.973
about what went wrong, I think
the analysis is fundamentally flawed

1031
00:51:08.973 --> 00:51:11.682
that says, "We offered too much,
it was all too good,"

1032
00:51:11.682 --> 00:51:14.390
and these voters in these parts
of the country

1033
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.057
where I never expected, growing up,

1034
00:51:16.057 --> 00:51:18.182
to see the Conservative Party
winning seats,

1035
00:51:18.182 --> 00:51:20.348
it was always a dry run
for Conservatives,

1036
00:51:20.348 --> 00:51:23.390
and they scuttled back down to,
ooh, I don’t know, Oxfordshire,

1037
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:28.057
it was a huge change
in the political landscape.

1038
00:51:28.057 --> 00:51:30.432
To say, "Well, we can get round it
by doing some deals

1039
00:51:30.432 --> 00:51:33.390
"or trying to advocate for changes
to the electoral system,"

1040
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.432
they may be good things,
some of them, in their own right,

1041
00:51:36.432 --> 00:51:39.307
but I don’t think they are
anywhere near the answer

1042
00:51:39.307 --> 00:51:41.890
to the scale of the defeat
you suffered. I think they are.

1043
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.682
When you start to say... I know
you do, but I disagree with you!

1044
00:51:44.682 --> 00:51:46.057
That’s why we’re here, right?

1045
00:51:46.057 --> 00:51:49.473
When you say, Jeremy Corbyn,
you gave him six out of ten,

1046
00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:52.223
Rebecca Long—Bailey
gave him ten out of ten,

1047
00:51:52.223 --> 00:51:54.932
and a bit of a laugh for that —

1048
00:51:54.932 --> 00:51:57.973
my goodness, how many seats,
in parts of the country

1049
00:51:57.973 --> 00:52:00.557
that had never voted Tory
in living memory,

1050
00:52:00.557 --> 00:52:04.140
would you have to lose
before you would say, actually,

1051
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.473
this was closer
to nought out of ten?

1052
00:52:06.473 --> 00:52:09.682
That is the real position
the Labour Party is in,

1053
00:52:09.682 --> 00:52:14.140
and it will only come back from that
when it faces up to it

1054
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.807
and works out that if
it is not forward looking,

1055
00:52:16.807 --> 00:52:20.598
if it cannot support a vision
for enterprise, for innovation,

1056
00:52:20.598 --> 00:52:23.098
as well as for the things
that you hold dear —

1057
00:52:23.098 --> 00:52:24.640
equality, poverty alleviation —

1058
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.057
and I respect you
very much for that,

1059
00:52:27.057 --> 00:52:29.515
and I think the right of centre
has learnt a lot from that.

1060
00:52:29.515 --> 00:52:31.265
The trouble is,
they have learned from it —

1061
00:52:31.265 --> 00:52:33.432
you have not learnt
from the other end of the spectrum,

1062
00:52:33.432 --> 00:52:34.973
and that is why you were smashed,

1063
00:52:34.973 --> 00:52:37.890
and you need to think hard and fast
about how you come back from it.

1064
00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:42.473
Brandon, we know who the nominees
are, Clive is one of them.

1065
00:52:42.473 --> 00:52:44.432
Who do you fear the most?

1066
00:52:44.432 --> 00:52:47.932
Well, taking that point,
and Rochelle’s original question,

1067
00:52:47.932 --> 00:52:50.848
I am somewhat [oath
to give advice to Labour,

1068
00:52:50.848 --> 00:52:54.182
and Clive and his colleagues,
on how they come back —

1069
00:52:54.182 --> 00:52:57.473
but there is a couple of
key points to think about.

1070
00:52:57.473 --> 00:53:00.598
Today has been a good example
of Labour’s problem.

1071
00:53:00.598 --> 00:53:03.473
The reality is, the British public
voted in a referendum,

1072
00:53:03.473 --> 00:53:05.807
we had a clear result
in the general election

1073
00:53:05.807 --> 00:53:08.765
where nobody doubts that the key
issues in that general election

1074
00:53:08.765 --> 00:53:10.598
were people’s concern about Corbyn —

1075
00:53:10.598 --> 00:53:13.098
I spent a lot of time in the
Midlands and the North of England —

1076
00:53:13.098 --> 00:53:16.057
and wanted to see the Government
deliver on a democratic decision

1077
00:53:16.057 --> 00:53:18.848
and get Brexit done. What happened
today in the vote on Brexit?

1078
00:53:18.848 --> 00:53:21.098
Labour and Clive voted
against it again.

1079
00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:23.432
What we are seeing is
a group of people standing

1080
00:53:23.432 --> 00:53:26.473
to lead the Labour Party who just
weeks ago were telling the country

1081
00:53:26.473 --> 00:53:28.598
that Corbyn was the answer
to their problems.

1082
00:53:28.598 --> 00:53:30.973
Suddenly now they think
they are the fresh start.

1083
00:53:30.973 --> 00:53:32.640
I just don’t think that works
for Labour.

1084
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.723
0K.
APPMUSE

1085
00:53:35.973 --> 00:53:37.515
We haven’t got that much time left,

1086
00:53:37.515 --> 00:53:39.515
I just want to get
one question which...

1087
00:53:39.515 --> 00:53:41.973
a number of people put
this forward, actually.

1088
00:53:41.973 --> 00:53:45.348
Let’s hear from Jo Gearing.
Jo, where are you?

1089
00:53:45.348 --> 00:53:47.140
Yes.

1090
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:50.432
Are special advisers
a threat to democracy?

1091
00:53:50.432 --> 00:53:52.432
So, who are you thinking
about there, Jo?

1092
00:53:52.432 --> 00:53:54.890
Dominic Cummings comes to mind.

1093
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.598
0K, and what’s making you think
that in particular?

1094
00:53:57.598 --> 00:53:59.848
Obviously he’s the special adviser
to Borisjohnson.

1095
00:53:59.848 --> 00:54:03.682
Yeah. Well, I’m concerned
about the disdain for the processes

1096
00:54:03.682 --> 00:54:08.890
of Westminster and Whitehall,
and the power he wields

1097
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:14.307
in masterminding the proroguing
of Parliament

1098
00:54:14.307 --> 00:54:22.140
and refusing to appear before a
select committee that Parliament...

1099
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.765
Yes. Some time ago, that was. Yeah.

1100
00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:27.390
He’s a bit of a mystery,
Dominic Cummings.

1101
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.390
He put out this job ad

1102
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:34.432
calling for wild cards
and super—talented weirdos.

1103
00:54:34.432 --> 00:54:39.390
For a personal assistant,
he’s a bit of a mystery.

1104
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.432
50, Brandon, you know the man well.

1105
00:54:41.432 --> 00:54:44.140
I thought the job advert
was a good thing to do.

1106
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:48.098
Anybody who applies for that will go
through the proper process,

1107
00:54:48.098 --> 00:54:50.723
but we want to hear from
notjust the normal people,

1108
00:54:50.723 --> 00:54:52.682
we want people to get
involved in politics

1109
00:54:52.682 --> 00:54:54.265
and be involved in government.

1110
00:54:54.265 --> 00:54:57.182
I have worked with special advisers,
I have a special adviser,

1111
00:54:57.182 --> 00:54:59.723
they play an important...
always have done.

1112
00:54:59.723 --> 00:55:01.682
Go back to the Labour years,
or through ours,

1113
00:55:01.682 --> 00:55:03.640
special advisers do play
an important part,

1114
00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.098
working with the Civil Service,
with ministers

1115
00:55:06.098 --> 00:55:08.348
and giving a political input.
They are important.

1116
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:10.057
We are very lucky in this country.

1117
00:55:10.057 --> 00:55:13.307
I’m sure, if you talk to some of
the Labour ministers of the past,

1118
00:55:13.307 --> 00:55:15.973
they will say the same,
we have some very smart people

1119
00:55:15.973 --> 00:55:19.432
who are not elected politicians
but have something to contribute

1120
00:55:19.432 --> 00:55:21.432
and are able to play
an important part.

1121
00:55:21.432 --> 00:55:24.015
I have seen Dominic Cummings
in action.

1122
00:55:24.015 --> 00:55:27.807
I think he is someone who is really
powerful at opening up new ideas,

1123
00:55:27.807 --> 00:55:31.557
driving things forward and asking
questions and challenging things,

1124
00:55:31.557 --> 00:55:35.098
as special advisers are meant to do,
and ministers are there to do.

1125
00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:38.848
It is for ministers to appear
in front of a select committee,

1126
00:55:38.848 --> 00:55:41.223
as we do, and we get grilled
for that.

1127
00:55:41.223 --> 00:55:44.432
I think special advisers play
an important part in politics.

1128
00:55:44.432 --> 00:55:47.307
I was pleased to see that kind of
advert that’s saying to people,

1129
00:55:47.307 --> 00:55:49.390
"If you don’t come from
the kind of background

1130
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:52.432
"that you think normally has a job
to do in Westminster,

1131
00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.015
"don’t let that stop you.

1132
00:55:54.015 --> 00:55:57.390
"If you’ve got something to say,
if you’ve got something interesting,

1133
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.390
"come and apply,
and be part of something

1134
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.473
"that could be quite exciting
and interesting,

1135
00:56:01.473 --> 00:56:03.598
"because you’ve always
got something to say."

1136
00:56:03.598 --> 00:56:05.557
When you say
"exciting and interesting" —

1137
00:56:05.557 --> 00:56:08.182
it did also say, "It will involve
lots of uninteresting trivia

1138
00:56:08.182 --> 00:56:10.682
"that makes my life easier,
which you won’t enjoy."

1139
00:56:10.682 --> 00:56:12.723
Well, he is making that point
that it is hard work.

1140
00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:15.432
You are really selling this job!
It is really hard work,

1141
00:56:15.432 --> 00:56:17.848
and special advisers,
part of theirjob is to make sure

1142
00:56:17.848 --> 00:56:20.348
we are challenging policy
and make sure we have got policy

1143
00:56:20.348 --> 00:56:22.390
that can deliver for people
across the country.

1144
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:23.640
There is a hard grind to that,

1145
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.973
but we are going into
an exciting time for our country

1146
00:56:25.973 --> 00:56:27.932
and people have the chance
to be a part of it.

1147
00:56:27.932 --> 00:56:31.432
Being more serious about it,
which is what you’re referring to,

1148
00:56:31.432 --> 00:56:35.765
have special advisers, "spads", as
they’re known, become too powerful?

1149
00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:39.390
My first reaction with Dominic
Cummings’ remark about weirdos —

1150
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:43.473
we should restrict the weirdos to
the benches of the House of Commons.

1151
00:56:43.473 --> 00:56:46.390
I think we need...
CLIVE: That’s a bit much!

1152
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:51.973
Clive has taken some offence
at that. It’s probably true.

1153
00:56:51.973 --> 00:56:53.598
We need serious
career administrators.

1154
00:56:53.598 --> 00:56:55.390
The Civil Service is not perfect,

1155
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:57.682
and there is plenty of scope
for improvement —

1156
00:56:57.682 --> 00:57:01.015
but the idea the Civil Service
should be...

1157
00:57:01.015 --> 00:57:04.015
One of the problems, the
Civil Service has become demoralised

1158
00:57:04.015 --> 00:57:05.682
by the cult of special advisers,

1159
00:57:05.682 --> 00:57:09.182
that too manyjobs are being given
to unelected people

1160
00:57:09.182 --> 00:57:11.890
simply by arbitrary decisions
of ministers.

1161
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.598
I think we need to boost
the Civil Service

1162
00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:18.890
and restore the morale and faith
in the Civil Service as a career.

1163
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:21.640
I certainly don’t think
if Dominic Cummings

1164
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.432
is going to be any sort of exemplar
of who will run this country,

1165
00:57:25.432 --> 00:57:28.223
I would sooner stick with
Sir Humphrey.

1166
00:57:28.223 --> 00:57:31.640
I think Sir Humphrey was afar
better person to run Britain

1167
00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.182
than Dominic Cummings.

1168
00:57:33.182 --> 00:57:35.723
I would just say... Briefly.
Really briefly.

1169
00:57:35.723 --> 00:57:38.932
To be very clear, these two things
are not mutually exclusive.

1170
00:57:38.932 --> 00:57:41.848
I think the Civil Service
in this country is phenomenal.

1171
00:57:41.848 --> 00:57:44.598
Having good special advisers
working with the Civil Service

1172
00:57:44.598 --> 00:57:47.015
is what delivers for our country —
with ministers.

1173
00:57:47.015 --> 00:57:49.057
Anne. It shows you’re
getting on a bit

1174
00:57:49.057 --> 00:57:51.598
when you remember
the New Labour special adviser,

1175
00:57:51.598 --> 00:57:54.223
one of whom said there were
17 people who run the country,

1176
00:57:54.223 --> 00:57:56.390
and exactly the same sort
of question

1177
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.057
as the lady in the audience put
was being asked —

1178
00:57:59.057 --> 00:58:01.640
I think special advisers
and civil servants,

1179
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.098
they are a ying and yang,

1180
00:58:03.098 --> 00:58:05.890
perhaps even more a relationship,
sometimes, of dogs and lamp posts —

1181
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:07.432
they don’t always get along.

1182
00:58:07.432 --> 00:58:10.140
I think the sort of
Dominic Cummings, disruption,

1183
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.223
we had it in the Cameron era
with Steve Hilton,

1184
00:58:12.223 --> 00:58:15.015
they were always incredibly
badly dressed and quite difficult,

1185
00:58:15.015 --> 00:58:17.140
but I think they do
shake up the system, Max.

1186
00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.557
As much as I admire
the Sir Humphreys,

1187
00:58:19.557 --> 00:58:24.307
and if she’s female, Sir Henrietta -
Lady Henrietta -

1188
00:58:24.307 --> 00:58:28.390
you do need this sort of shock
to the system sometimes.

1189
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:32.015
I don’t mind that Dominic Cummings
wants to bring in different people

1190
00:58:32.015 --> 00:58:33.765
and have different kinds of roles

1191
00:58:33.765 --> 00:58:35.682
and a bit more challenge
to the system.

1192
00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:37.015
Our politics is changing,

1193
00:58:37.015 --> 00:58:39.765
and we need to bring different
people into the heart of it.

1194
00:58:39.765 --> 00:58:41.890
The only thing that rankled with me

1195
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.515
is if say that you want
super—talented weirdos

1196
00:58:44.515 --> 00:58:46.348
and that they should think
outside the box,

1197
00:58:46.348 --> 00:58:48.807
and then say, "Oh, by the way,
if you don’t get along with us,

1198
00:58:48.807 --> 00:58:50.890
"we will bin you within a month,"

1199
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.473
I thought, well, you do then
have to acknowledge

1200
00:58:53.473 --> 00:58:56.515
that there is a bit of
a contradiction there,

1201
00:58:56.515 --> 00:58:59.098
and the system has
to allow for people

1202
00:58:59.098 --> 00:59:01.682
to feel free to speak their minds
in government

1203
00:59:01.682 --> 00:59:05.598
and not feel they have to be
part of, how shall I put it...

1204
00:59:05.598 --> 00:59:07.223
a sort of Boris cult.

1205
00:59:07.223 --> 00:59:09.973
Would you be looking
forsuperweirdos, Clive?

1206
00:59:09.973 --> 00:59:12.473
There’s probably enough of them
in Parliament already,

1207
00:59:12.473 --> 00:59:15.098
as Max was saying.
So, Ifind Dominic Cummings —

1208
00:59:15.098 --> 00:59:18.848
does he undermined democracy?
He’s like a Rasputin—type character.

1209
00:59:18.848 --> 00:59:21.598
You kind of feel,
"If only the Tsar knew!"

1210
00:59:21.598 --> 00:59:25.557
But actually I think BorisJohnson
and the Government are quite happy,

1211
00:59:25.557 --> 00:59:28.932
because he isn’t accountable,
and he can do all of these things,

1212
00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:32.182
and he can be the bullet magnet
which takes the ﬂak —

1213
00:59:32.182 --> 00:59:35.807
but actually, what this comes down
to is a lack of accountability

1214
00:59:35.807 --> 00:59:39.390
of our government and the executive,
of which he is a functionary.

1215
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:41.765
I think what it comes down to,
really, when you analyse it,

1216
00:59:41.765 --> 00:59:45.932
is that Dominic Cummings
ultimately wields power

1217
00:59:45.932 --> 00:59:51.348
because he is allowed to by the
executive and by the Prime Minister.

1218
00:59:51.348 --> 00:59:53.932
Until you can hold
the Prime Minister accountable

1219
00:59:53.932 --> 00:59:55.932
in a far better way,
and the executive,

1220
00:59:55.932 --> 00:59:59.307
then I am afraid to say people
like Dominic Cummings

1221
00:59:59.307 --> 01:00:02.390
will always be seen as these
characters who wield this power —

1222
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.223
but actually, he doesn’t.
He has the power

1223
01:00:04.223 --> 01:00:07.390
because BorisJohnson and
the executive give him that power.

1224
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:11.890
Miatta? Having been both a civil
servant and a special adviser,

1225
01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.432
there is clearly a role for both,

1226
01:00:13.432 --> 01:00:15.932
and it is important for
how government functions.

1227
01:00:15.932 --> 01:00:19.640
I do, however, think that Dominic
Cummins is a bit renegade —

1228
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.432
that’s his brand, that’s what
he does, he goes in, he disrupts,

1229
01:00:22.432 --> 01:00:24.723
you know, he’s difficult
to work with.

1230
01:00:24.723 --> 01:00:26.473
He does things
that are uncontroversial,

1231
01:00:26.473 --> 01:00:28.182
does things that shake up
the system...

1232
01:00:28.182 --> 01:00:30.223
That are controversial,
not uncontroversial.

1233
01:00:30.223 --> 01:00:34.057
That are controversial, and does
things that shake up the system

1234
01:00:34.057 --> 01:00:38.015
and I think creating some change
and pace in the Civil Service

1235
01:00:38.015 --> 01:00:39.140
is a good thing.

1236
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.598
The appetite to do that is...
But there are ways to do it.

1237
01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:45.723
If he wants to wage a war
against the very Civil Service

1238
01:00:45.723 --> 01:00:48.432
the Government needs to deliver
its free trade agreement,

1239
01:00:48.432 --> 01:00:51.223
to deliver any of the change
they claim they want to make

1240
01:00:51.223 --> 01:00:54.557
in the country, you cannot go
trashing and destroying

1241
01:00:54.557 --> 01:00:56.973
the Civil Service,
who have done a phenomenaljob

1242
01:00:56.973 --> 01:00:59.140
against a difficult
political background.

1243
01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.015
You were a special adviser —

1244
01:01:01.015 --> 01:01:04.765
what would you say the top attribute
of a top spad should be?

1245
01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:07.640
Be humble, be smart, listen
and work with your colleagues —

1246
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.057
unfortunately, I don’t think
he always does these things.

1247
01:01:11.057 --> 01:01:14.265
Humble sped! I can’t get
Dead Ringers out of my head,

1248
01:01:14.265 --> 01:01:17.140
which is that he’s the undead
Jonathan Harker.

1249
01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.223
Which I find quite amusing!
But that’s in my own personal...

1250
01:01:20.223 --> 01:01:23.598
Well, I’m afraid we are out of time,

1251
01:01:23.598 --> 01:01:26.473
much as we could go on
talking about special advisers,

1252
01:01:26.473 --> 01:01:27.848
Dominic Cummings and others.

1253
01:01:27.848 --> 01:01:30.140
Next week we are in Liverpool

1254
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.015
and the following week, we will be
in Stoke Newington in London.

1255
01:01:35.015 --> 01:01:37.640
So callus if you would like
to be in the audience,

1256
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.723
or go to the Question Time website —

1257
01:01:39.723 --> 01:01:42.057
you can follow
the instructions there.

1258
01:01:42.057 --> 01:01:46.640
You can have this conversation
on Radio 5 Live

1259
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.598
on Question Time Extra Time
with Adrian Childs and guests,

1260
01:01:50.598 --> 01:01:52.348
and that is starting now.

1261
01:01:52.348 --> 01:01:54.432
But for now, thank you to my panel,

1262
01:01:54.432 --> 01:01:56.473
to the audience for coming along

1263
01:01:56.473 --> 01:01:59.348
and to you at home
for listening and watching.

1264
01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.723
From Oxford, bye—bye.

1265
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:37.557
Will I be big enough for big school?
You will be, yeah!

1266
01:02:37.557 --> 01:02:40.265
Is it supposed to taste like... ?
Yes. It is.

1267
01:02:40.265 --> 01:02:41.848
What’s wrong with the telly?

1268
01:02:41.848 --> 01:02:43.640
MAN CHUCKLES
It’s not even on!

1269
01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.723
What does this even do?

1270
01:02:45.723 --> 01:02:47.223
Why doesn’t he like me?

1271
01:02:47.223 --> 01:02:48.890
How fast is this?
Really fast!

1272
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.848
What have I missed? Where’s my other
shoe? What are we having? Lasagne!

1273
01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:53.265
Dad!
(“an I get hair extensions?

1274
01:02:53.265 --> 01:02:55.348
No. No.
What is this?!

1275
01:02:55.348 --> 01:02:57.015
ALL: Where’s my charger?

1276
01:02:57.015 --> 01:02:59.223
Why do we have day and night?

1277
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.390
You can’t have all the answers,
and for the times you don’t...

1278
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:05.723
Where’s the laptop?

1279
01:03:05.723 --> 01:03:08.765
..there’s BBC Bitesize,
the online learning resource

1280
01:03:08.765 --> 01:03:12.223
for primary starters, exam takers
and everything in—between.

1281
01:03:27.098 --> 01:03:31.723
All this week, we’ve been in the
Cardiff area, where these five

1282
01:03:31.723 --> 01:03:36.432
inquisitive locals have been allowed
to judge some superb homes

1283
01:03:36.432 --> 01:03:38.890
that are the pride and joy
of their owners.

1284
01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:40.473
Wow!

1285
01:03:40.473 --> 01:03:43.557
They’ve beenjudging how functional
the homes are...

1286
01:03:43.557 --> 01:03:47.223
Wow! Look at that storage!
I can live here!

1287
01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:49.807
..the ambition of the interior
design...

1288
01:03:49.807 --> 01:03:55.265
Oh, it’s a chandelier
in the bathroom. I love it!

1289
01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:57.140
..and finally that X—factor.

1290
01:03:59.307 --> 01:04:01.890
Ah, look at this!
Now we’re talking.

1291
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:03.723
The element of surprise.

1292
01:04:03.723 --> 01:04:06.932
A bit of a shock. You don’t
expect this in a farmhouse.

1293
01:04:06.932 --> 01:04:09.140
After much scrutinising...

1294
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.265
I like that they haven’t ripped
that up and put a seamless floor in.

1295
01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:16.057
..these localjudges
selected four finalists.

1296
01:04:18.057 --> 01:04:23.307
A modernised Edwardian terrace,
with sleek styling, hidden trinkets

1297
01:04:23.307 --> 01:04:25.432
and warm pink overtones.

1298
01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:29.015
Feels feminine. At the same time,

1299
01:04:29.015 --> 01:04:31.890
it’s got a nice structure to it.

1300
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:38.057
Our wild card winner — a rigorously
renovated 19th—century bathhouse,

1301
01:04:38.057 --> 01:04:41.557
with luxury spoils
and contemporary character.

1302
01:04:41.557 --> 01:04:43.765
I love the frameless glass
entrance as you come in,

1303
01:04:43.765 --> 01:04:46.557
so it’s all
about the architecture.

1304
01:04:46.557 --> 01:04:50.890
A rustic three—bed semidetached
