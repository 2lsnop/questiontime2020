64
00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.244
do you believe we can do to address
this? Of course, this is prompted by

65
00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:44.244
this? Of course, this is prompted by
the horrific death of George Floyd

66
00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:49.077
the horrific death of George Floyd
in Minneapolis. David? Well, er...

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.869
us, but I think what’s striking
about this moment is that, when you

72
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.827
about this moment is that, when you
look at the protest, it’s black and

your mask but, yes, protest, make

160
00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:41.077
your mask but, yes, protest, make
some noise and take this all the way

161
00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:42.202
some noise and take this all the way
to November, because we know what

162
00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:42.744
to November, because we know what
Donald Tmmp is

163
00:05:42.744 --> 00:05:45.869
to November, because we know what
Donald Trump is up to. This is

164
00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:46.160
Donald Tmmp is up to. This is
deliberate,

165
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.119
Donald Trump is up to. This is
deliberate, the military, they are

166
00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.702
deliberate, the military, they are
railing for

167
00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:49.494
deliberate, the military, they are
calling for shooting, his behaviour,

168
00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:50.035
railing for shooting, his behaviour,
he is winding

169
00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:51.994
calling for shooting, his behaviour,
he is winding up parts of his face

170
00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:53.494
he is winding up parts of his face
who want to see this conflict

171
00:05:53.494 --> 00:05:55.535
who want to see this conflict
between black and white in his

172
00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:56.952
between black and white in his
country, because he thinks it might

173
00:05:56.952 --> 00:05:59.952
country, because he thinks it might
keep him in office. Stand up to it.

174
00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:04.827
keep him in office. Stand up to it.
Your question was about does the UK

175
00:06:04.827 --> 00:06:05.119
Your question was about does the UK
suffer from

176
00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.369
Your question was about does the UK
sufferfrom similar

177
00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.952
Your question was about does the UK
suffer from similar systemic racial

178
00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:07.202
suffer from similar systemic racial
issues. What is your view and

179
00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:11.244
issues. what is your view and
experience?

180
00:06:11.244 --> 00:06:11.660
issues. What is your view and
experience? Well, I

181
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.119
issues. What is your view and
experience? Well, Ithink, without

182
00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:13.035
experience? Well, Ithink, without
question, I think everyone would

183
00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:18.952
question, I think everyone would
know. I think we’ve come from a

184
00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:22.244
know. I think we’ve come from a
time, talking about going back

185
00:06:22.244 --> 00:06:25.910
time, talking about going back
decades and centuries, where there

186
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.952
decades and centuries, where there
were structural implementations that

187
00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:32.452
were stmctural implementations that
were

188
00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:35.994
were structural implementations that
were conscious that disadvantaged

189
00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:39.285
were conscious that disadvantaged
black people and people of colour,

190
00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:39.452
black peopla and peopla of colour,
and

191
00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:40.827
black people and people of colour,
and then we’ve moved forward into a

192
00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:47.744
and then we’ve moved forward into a
situation whereby it’s probably

193
00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:50.077
situation whereby it’s probably
stubborn, a stubborn approach to,

194
00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:52.494
stubborn, a stubborn approach to,
0K, we know there is something going

195
00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:57.452
0K, we know there is something going
on. No, we are not really ready to

196
00:06:57.452 --> 00:06:59.702
on. No, we are not really ready to
do that yet. And then, probably more

197
00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:01.410
do that yet. And then, probably more
recently, it’s been more like an

198
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.619
recently, it’s been more like an
apathy for sub is the spotlight on

199
00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:05.369
apathy for sub is the spotlight on
us? Not really, let’s leave it for a

200
00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:09.327
us? Not really, let’s leave it for a
bit. But now the spotlight is on,

201
00:07:09.327 --> 00:07:13.327
bit. But now the spotlight is on,
and obviously prevention is always

202
00:07:13.327 --> 00:07:17.285
and obviously prevention is always
better than cure, and here we are in

203
00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:20.660
better than cure, and here we are in
a situation where, if prevention had

204
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.869
a situation where, if prevention had
been implemented, then we wouldn’t

205
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:27.327
been implemented, then we wouldn’t
see the ugliness that we’ve seen, in

206
00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:31.452
see the ugliness that we’ve seen, in
terms of... What I mean is, in terms

207
00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:33.994
terms of... what I mean is, in terms
of the protest, I’m

208
00:07:33.994 --> 00:07:34.577
terms of... What I mean is, in terms
of the protest, I’m not calling that

209
00:07:34.577 --> 00:07:35.619
of the protest, I’m not calling that
ugliness, I’m calling that desperate

210
00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:35.827
ugliness, I’m falling that desperate
and

211
00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:38.702
ugliness, I’m calling that desperate
and passionate. These are ugly

212
00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:42.577
and passionate. These are ugly
scenes, nobody wants to see this.

213
00:07:42.577 --> 00:07:43.827
scenes, nobody wants to see this.
They have been lots of peaceful

214
00:07:43.827 --> 00:07:45.119
They have been lots of peaceful
protests and you are talking about

215
00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:46.327
protests and you are talking about
those where there has been violence

216
00:07:46.327 --> 00:07:54.452
those where there has been violence
and looting. Yes. I wanted to ask,

217
00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:55.702
and looting. Yes. I wanted to ask,
Donna, looking at your career, which

218
00:07:55.702 --> 00:08:00.577
Donna, looking at your career, which
is stellar, you must have broken

219
00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:01.702
is stellar, you must have broken
through quite a few glass ceilings

220
00:08:01.702 --> 00:08:05.035
through quite a few glass ceilings
to get where you have. You still see

221
00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:07.952
to get where you have. You still see
systemic issues of racism in the UK?

222
00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:11.785
systemic issues of racism in the UK?
As a nurse, you see it every day.

223
00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:13.369
As a nurse, you see it every day.
You see it both in the structure you

224
00:08:13.369 --> 00:08:14.327
You see it both in the stmcture you
are within, in

225
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.785
You see it both in the structure you
are within, in the institution of

226
00:08:16.785 --> 00:08:19.827
are within, in the institution of
health, the NHS institution. If you

227
00:08:19.827 --> 00:08:21.202
health, the NHS institution. If you
look at how many managers have

228
00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:23.952
look at how many managers have
broken through the glass ceiling,

229
00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:25.160
broken through the glass ceiling,
black managers, you will see there

230
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.535
black managers, you will see there
are very few Philip but also, as a

231
00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:30.077
are very few Philip but also, as a
nurse, we face these issues on a

232
00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:31.535
nurse, we face these issues on a
daily basis stop at the outcomes for

233
00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:34.119
daily basis stop at the outcomes for
our patients. Every single measure

234
00:08:34.119 --> 00:08:36.577
our patients. Every single measure
that you ran

235
00:08:36.577 --> 00:08:38.827
our patients. Every single measure
that you can apply, the outcomes are

236
00:08:38.827 --> 00:08:39.202
that you ran apply, the outcomes are
worse for

237
00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.035
that you can apply, the outcomes are
worse for black and minority ethnic

238
00:08:41.035 --> 00:08:43.827
worse for black and minority ethnic
patients. Whether it is diabetes,

239
00:08:43.827 --> 00:08:45.494
patients. Whether it is diabetes,
whether it is those that end up with

240
00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:50.119
whether it is those that end up with
amputations, the structure of our

241
00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:50.785
amputations, the stmcture of our
society is

242
00:08:50.785 --> 00:08:51.369
amputations, the structure of our
society is inherent, the structural

243
00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:51.702
society is inherent, the stmctural
racism is

244
00:08:51.702 --> 00:08:52.535
society is inherent, the structural
racism is inherent, and the outcomes

245
00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:53.952
racism is inherent, and the outcomes
are poor for a

246
00:08:53.952 --> 00:08:57.202
racism is inherent, and the outcomes
are poorfor a number of people that

247
00:08:57.202 --> 00:08:57.744
are poor for a number of peopla that
are of black,

248
00:08:57.744 --> 00:08:58.327
are poorfor a number of people that
are of black, Asian and minority

249
00:08:58.327 --> 00:09:01.369
are of black, Asian and minority
ethnic communities. 50,

250
00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:01.535
are of black, Asian and minority
ethnic communities. So, personally

251
00:09:01.535 --> 00:09:02.119
ethnic communities. So, personally
to me in

252
00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:03.535
ethnic communities. 50, personally
to me in terms of my career, yes, we

253
00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:07.535
to me in terms of my career, yes, we
do have to bash down some glass

254
00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:08.619
do have to bash down some glass
ceilings and circumvent some overtly

255
00:09:08.619 --> 00:09:09.077
ceilings and circumvent some overtly
racist peopla,

256
00:09:09.077 --> 00:09:12.369
ceilings and circumvent some overtly
racist people, but for me just look

257
00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:13.119
racist peopla, but for me just look
at the

258
00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.119
racist people, but for me just look
at the health of our nation, and

259
00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:16.369
at the health of our nation, and
that will tell you about some of the

260
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:17.202
that will tell you about some of the
structural inequalities that we

261
00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:19.744
stmctural inequalities that we
have.

262
00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:21.327
structural inequalities that we
have. Is racism something you have

263
00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:25.744
have. Is racism something you have
had direct experience of? Yes, to

264
00:09:25.744 --> 00:09:26.910
had direct experience of? Yes, to
the question, I don’t think anyone

265
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.994
the question, I don’t think anyone
of my colour or Olu ‘s, or David or

266
00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:34.535
of my colour or Olu ‘s, or David or
Donna would say they haven’t, it’ll

267
00:09:34.535 --> 00:09:37.535
Donna would say they haven’t, it’ll
most impossible to when we first

268
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:37.785
most impossible to when we first
name

269
00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:38.827
most impossible to when we first
came to this country, my parents

270
00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:40.452
fame to this country, my parents
fame as

271
00:09:40.452 --> 00:09:41.077
came to this country, my parents
came as Kurdish immigrants from

272
00:09:41.077 --> 00:09:41.452
fame as Kurdish immigrants from
Iran, the

273
00:09:41.452 --> 00:09:42.994
came as Kurdish immigrants from
Iran, the first thing people called

274
00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:47.535
Iran, the first thing peopla rallad
me was

275
00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:49.077
Iran, the first thing people called
me was a Pakistani, and then I had

276
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:50.702
me was a Pakistani, and then I had
to explain that I was really

277
00:09:50.702 --> 00:09:52.660
to explain that I was really
Kurdish, and then you got bullied. I

278
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.119
Kurdish, and then you got bullied. I
saw a horrific video online of two

279
00:09:58.119 --> 00:09:59.577
saw a horrific video online of two
white kids are scared black kid to

280
00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:01.910
white kids are scared black kid to
go down and kiss their feet. You get

281
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.369
go down and kiss their feet. You get
that sort of behaviour at school at

282
00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.244
that sort of behaviour at school at
the time. But you try and survive

283
00:10:05.244 --> 00:10:07.869
the time. But you try and survive
it. I’d like to think things have

284
00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:11.202
it. I’d like to think things have
changed and they have in many ways,

285
00:10:11.202 --> 00:10:13.535
changed and they have in many ways,
but I think some of it has been

286
00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:15.869
but I think some of it has been
transformed to social media. Back to

287
00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:17.410
transformed to social media. Back to
David Button point or mine or Donna,

288
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.577
David Button point or mine or Donna,
you still get casual racism every

289
00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.619
you still get casual racism every
day, he doesn’t quite belong in

290
00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:25.244
day, he doesn’t quite belong in
Stratford—on—Avon, you know, he

291
00:10:25.244 --> 00:10:25.619
Stratford-on-Avon, you know, he
isn’t from

292
00:10:25.619 --> 00:10:26.535
Stratford—on—Avon, you know, he
isn’t from here. That sort of thing

293
00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:27.619
isn’t from here. That sort of thing
that it’s difficult for somebody

294
00:10:27.619 --> 00:10:32.952
that it’s difficult for somebody
with a name like Zahawi to claim he

295
00:10:32.952 --> 00:10:35.160
with a name like Zahawi to claim he
is born and bred in Stratford but

296
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.244
is born and bred in Stratford but
nonetheless I think things are

297
00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:37.410
nonetheless I think things are
getting better and lots of people

298
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.619
getting better and lots of people
are speaking up. Millions of people

299
00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:40.869
are speaking up. Millions of peopla
have

300
00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:43.952
are speaking up. Millions of people
have come out and said, enough is

301
00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:47.744
have come out and said, enough is
enough. Tag the equalities minister

302
00:10:47.744 --> 00:10:50.702
enough. Tag the equalities minister
said today that the UK plan, Cribbs

303
00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:52.327
said today that the UK plan, Cribbs
is one of the best countries in the

304
00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:53.327
is one of the best countries in the
world the quality

305
00:10:57.327 --> 00:10:59.952
because there are lots of great
things that happened in this country

306
00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:01.327
things that happened in this country
that have allowed people like

307
00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:01.577
that have allowed peopla like
myself,

308
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.494
that have allowed people like
myself, David and Donat to do well,

309
00:11:03.494 --> 00:11:04.327
myself, David and Donat to do well,
but we can

310
00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:04.494
myself, David and Donat to do well,
but we ran go

311
00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:05.285
myself, David and Donat to do well,
but we can go much further. I did

312
00:11:05.285 --> 00:11:05.994
but we ran go much further. I did
this in the

313
00:11:05.994 --> 00:11:06.494
but we can go much further. I did
this in the Department for Education

314
00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:08.994
this in the Department for Education
when I was families minister,

315
00:11:08.994 --> 00:11:09.785
when I was families minister,
working with the permanent

316
00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:12.285
working with the permanent
secretary, because the permanent

317
00:11:12.285 --> 00:11:13.077
secretary, because the permanent
secretary there basically didn’t

318
00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:14.785
secretary there basically didn’t
think that we were trying hard

319
00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:16.327
think that we were trying hard
enough because, if you look at the

320
00:11:16.327 --> 00:11:19.619
enough because, if you look at the
profile of the civil service, of

321
00:11:19.619 --> 00:11:20.952
profile of the civil service, of
parliamentarians, there are very few

322
00:11:20.952 --> 00:11:21.577
partiamentarians, there are very few
people of my

323
00:11:21.577 --> 00:11:22.702
parliamentarians, there are very few
people of my colour or David Button

324
00:11:22.702 --> 00:11:23.035
peopla of my colour or David Button
colour in

325
00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:25.327
people of my colour or David Button
colour in the leadership roles in

326
00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:28.660
colour in the leadership roles in
those institutions. Even in the

327
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.327
those institutions. Even in the
health service. We need to do

328
00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:32.494
health service. We need to do
better. There is no point us

329
00:11:32.494 --> 00:11:32.785
health service. We need to do
better. There is no point usjust

330
00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:33.327
better. There is no point us just
saying, it’s OK,

331
00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:34.202
better. There is no point usjust
saying, it’s OK, and that’s fine. We

332
00:11:34.202 --> 00:11:37.535
saying, it’s OK, and that’s fine. We
have to do better. I have to share

333
00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:41.202
have to do better. I have to share
this with the audience. My

334
00:11:41.202 --> 00:11:42.452
this with the audience. My
seven—year—old came up to me,

335
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:42.744
seven-year-old name up to me,
unprompted,

336
00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:46.327
seven—year—old came up to me,
unprompted, and said, dad, black

337
00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:48.202
unprompted, and said, dad, black
lives matter, and I looked and said,

338
00:11:48.202 --> 00:11:50.160
lives matter, and I looked and said,
where did you get that from? She

339
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.244
where did you get that from? She
says, dad, I got it from TikTok and

340
00:11:54.244 --> 00:11:56.285
says, dad, I got it from TikTok and
YouTube stop I said, what does it

341
00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:57.744
YouTube stop I said, what does it
mean? She says, it means nobody

342
00:11:57.744 --> 00:11:58.827
mean? She says, it means nobody
should be killed because of their

343
00:11:58.827 --> 00:12:03.702
should be killed because of their
colour. So presumably Trump’s

344
00:12:03.702 --> 00:12:05.452
colour. So presumably Trump’s
comments about, when the looting

345
00:12:05.452 --> 00:12:07.119
comments about, when the looting
starts, the shooting starts, you

346
00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:12.869
starts, the shooting starts, you
condemn that? any comments which

347
00:12:12.869 --> 00:12:16.619
condemn that? any comments which
caused division, I condemn that. I

348
00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:18.202
caused division, I condemn that. I
condemn that, at any other comment

349
00:12:18.202 --> 00:12:20.869
condemn that, at any other comment
which divides us. George W Bush made

350
00:12:20.869 --> 00:12:21.035
which divides us. George w Bush made
a

351
00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:23.160
which divides us. George W Bush made
a beautiful statement about how you

352
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.327
a beautiful statement about how you
bring people together, the country

353
00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.369
bring people together, the country
together, and I want to think of the

354
00:12:26.369 --> 00:12:27.327
together, and I want to think of the
millions of people who will

355
00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:30.577
millions of people who will
peacefully go out and demonstrate

356
00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:33.994
peacefully go out and demonstrate
the not the few agitators for the

357
00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:34.660
the not the few agitators for the
let’s hear from our

358
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.160
the not the few agitators for the
let’s hearfrom our audience. Laura.

359
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.327
let’s hear from our audience. laura.
I

360
00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:38.494
let’s hear from our audience. laura.
Ijust

361
00:12:38.494 --> 00:12:39.160
let’s hear from our audience. laura.
I just want to say

362
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.702
let’s hearfrom our audience. Laura.
I just want to say that you are

363
00:12:39.702 --> 00:12:44.244
I just want to say that you are
talking about how you want to

364
00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:45.744
talking about how you want to
address the racism in this country,

365
00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:48.327
address the racism in this country,
but the problem is, if we don’t

366
00:12:48.327 --> 00:12:49.744
but the problem is, if we don’t
start speaking out, if the

367
00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:50.952
start speaking out, if the
government doesn’t start speaking

368
00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:52.494
government doesn’t start speaking
out and condemning what is going on

369
00:12:52.494 --> 00:12:55.660
out and condemning what is going on
in America right now then we are

370
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.160
in America right now then we are
being bystanders and watching this

371
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.452
being bystanders and watching this
happen, and we are not trying to

372
00:12:59.452 --> 00:13:03.202
happen, and we are not trying to
stop it, and I think it’s all well

373
00:13:03.202 --> 00:13:04.327
stop it, and I think it’s all well
and good leaving the responsibility

374
00:13:04.327 --> 00:13:06.494
and good leaving the responsibility
to the public to be protesting at a

375
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.327
to the public to be protesting at a
time and we should be social

376
00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:09.202
time and we should be social
distancing but, because the

377
00:13:09.202 --> 00:13:10.202
distancing but, because the
government is doing nothing, they

378
00:13:10.202 --> 00:13:12.452
government is doing nothing, they
are complicit in the action the

379
00:13:12.452 --> 00:13:12.660
are complicit in the action the
pub“:

380
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.660
are complicit in the action the
public is having to take to show our

381
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.285
public is having to take to show our
support for America,

382
00:13:16.285 --> 00:13:16.452
public is having to take to show our
support forAmerica, because

383
00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:16.619
public is having to take to show our
support for America, because nobody

384
00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:19.327
support for America, because nobody
in the government is doing that.

385
00:13:19.327 --> 00:13:23.327
in the government is doing that.
First of all, I want to thank David

386
00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:24.827
First of all, I want to thank David
Lammy for the work he has done on

387
00:13:24.827 --> 00:13:26.577
Lammy for the work he has done on
educating nonblack people for years

388
00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:26.952
educating nonblack peopla for years
on this

389
00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:31.327
educating nonblack people for years
on this issue. But I also wanted to

390
00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:34.327
on this issue. But I also wanted to
address Nadhim Zahawi in asking him

391
00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:37.327
address Nadhim Zahawi in asking him
what his government is doing to

392
00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:41.160
what his government is doing to
improve the curriculum in schools? I

393
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.577
improve the curriculum in schools? I
think a huge amount of the problem

394
00:13:43.577 --> 00:13:45.744
think a huge amount of the problem
here comes from a lack of education

395
00:13:45.744 --> 00:13:47.535
here comes from a lack of education
about black history in the UK,

396
00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:48.952
about black history in the UK,
because it’s all well and good as

397
00:13:48.952 --> 00:13:50.077
because it’s all well and good as
looking at the United States now

398
00:13:50.077 --> 00:13:51.369
looking at the United States now
from a distance and saying, this

399
00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:54.494
from a distance and saying, this
isn’t our problem, but we had a

400
00:13:54.494 --> 00:13:54.910
isn’t our problam, but we had a
huge, long

401
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.910
isn’t our problem, but we had a
huge, long history in the UK from

402
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.369
huge, long history in the UK from
slavery at our ports to Windrush,

403
00:13:59.369 --> 00:13:59.619
slavery at our ports to windrush,
the

404
00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:01.202
slavery at our ports to Windrush,
the MacPherson report, and then

405
00:14:01.202 --> 00:14:03.744
the MacPherson report, and then
Diane Abbott becoming one of the

406
00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:05.327
Diane Abbott becoming one of the
first black MPs in the country. We

407
00:14:05.327 --> 00:14:09.410
first black MPs in the country. We
don’t learn that and now we have

408
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.702
don’t learn that and now we have
Bellingham agenda, who it looks like

409
00:14:10.702 --> 00:14:13.160
Bellingham agenda, who it looks like
the justice system has given up on,

410
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.077
the justice system has given up on,
and it’s because we don’t learn

411
00:14:15.077 --> 00:14:17.619
and it’s because we don’t learn
about these black voices, these

412
00:14:17.619 --> 00:14:21.285
about these black voices, these
black faces, and we just don’t know

413
00:14:21.285 --> 00:14:29.119
black faces, and we just don’t know
what our own history is. Hello. I

414
00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.494
what our own history is. Hello. I
just think it’s horrible, what’s

415
00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:30.702
just think it’s horribla, what’s
happened,

416
00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:33.910
just think it’s horrible, what’s
happened, but I wondered whether,

417
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.119
happened, but I wondered whether,
bearing in mind all the positive

418
00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:38.119
bearing in mind all the positive
vibes we’ve had, clapping every

419
00:14:38.119 --> 00:14:40.285
vibes we’ve had, clapping every
Thursday, we know that a lot of the

420
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:40.910
Thursday, we know that a lot of the
peopla, and I

421
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:41.119
Thursday, we know that a lot of the
peopla, and lam

422
00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:41.994
Thursday, we know that a lot of the
people, and I am sure Donna will

423
00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:42.494
peopla, and I am sure Donna will
agree with me,

424
00:14:42.494 --> 00:14:46.702
people, and I am sure Donna will
agree with me, who looked after us

425
00:14:46.702 --> 00:14:47.619
agree with me, who looked after us
come from ethnic minorities. Should

426
00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:49.994
come from ethnic minorities. Should
we not be harnessing that power and

427
00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:52.327
we not be harnessing that power and
doing something with it right now,

428
00:14:52.327 --> 00:14:56.410
doing something with it right now,
rather than allowing it to

429
00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.577
rather than allowing it to
disappear? I wondered whether any of

430
00:15:00.577 --> 00:15:02.077
disappear? I wondered whether any of
the politicians had ideas how we

431
00:15:02.077 --> 00:15:08.077
the politicians had ideas how we
could do this. Hugh Pennington, I

432
00:15:08.077 --> 00:15:09.660
could do this. Hugh Pennington, I
wanted to come to you on the

433
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.119
wanted to come to you on the
original question. To what extent

434
00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.577
original question. To what extent
does the panel think the UK suffers

435
00:15:13.577 --> 00:15:16.952
does the panel think the UK suffers
from systematic racial issues

436
00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:19.035
from systematic racial issues
similar to those in the States, and

437
00:15:19.035 --> 00:15:19.410
similar to those in the States, and
what ran

438
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.160
similar to those in the States, and
what can be done about it? Now, you

439
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.577
what ran be done about it? Now, you
were marching

440
00:15:22.577 --> 00:15:23.369
what can be done about it? Now, you
were marching after the death of

441
00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:27.452
were marching after the death of
Martin Luther King, so you have seen

442
00:15:27.452 --> 00:15:31.994
Martin Luther King, so you have seen
this over many years. Custom cut

443
00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:32.785
this over many years. Custom cut
that’s right. Really rather

444
00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:37.160
that’s right. Really rather
pessimistic. I lived in the US at

445
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.327
pessimistic. I lived in the US at
that time, and there were terrible

446
00:15:39.327 --> 00:15:40.577
that time, and there were terrible
things happening, and I went to

447
00:15:40.577 --> 00:15:41.660
things happening, and I went to
Chicago and the National Guard was

448
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.994
Chicago and the National Guard was
out on the streets everything seems

449
00:15:42.994 --> 00:15:44.952
out on the streets everything seems
to repeat itself of the I think an

450
00:15:44.952 --> 00:15:48.244
to repeat itself of the I think an
important thing we must do, and I

451
00:15:48.244 --> 00:15:49.702
important thing we must do, and I
agree with the audience member who

452
00:15:49.702 --> 00:15:52.494
agree with the audience member who
was talking about history, the US

453
00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.535
was talking about history, the US
has this terrible legacy of slavery,

454
00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:55.952
has this terrible legacy of slavery,
and we have a legacy from the

455
00:15:55.952 --> 00:15:59.660
and we have a legacy from the
Empire. Clearly, these are very

456
00:15:59.660 --> 00:15:59.869
Empire. Clearty, these are very
important

457
00:15:59.869 --> 00:16:01.244
Empire. Clearly, these are very
important historical things which

458
00:16:01.244 --> 00:16:04.827
important historical things which
still have a big effect and, if we

459
00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:08.660
still have a big effect and, if we
learn more about them... We should

460
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.119
learn more about them... We should
be learning about them at school,

461
00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:12.452
be learning about them at school,
learning about what happened at what

462
00:16:12.452 --> 00:16:13.910
learning about what happened at what
should be done correct any kind of

463
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.702
should be done correct any kind of
problams that

464
00:16:16.702 --> 00:16:17.577
should be done correct any kind of
problems that persist, and we know

465
00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:17.994
problams that persist, and we know
that many

466
00:16:17.994 --> 00:16:20.452
problems that persist, and we know
that many problems do persist. My

467
00:16:20.452 --> 00:16:20.577
that many problams do persist. My
pessimism

468
00:16:20.577 --> 00:16:23.244
that many problems do persist. My
pessimism will stay. I hope I am

469
00:16:23.244 --> 00:16:24.452
pessimism will stay. I hope I am
going to be more optimistic than

470
00:16:24.452 --> 00:16:30.327
going to be more optimistic than
that. After all, the US elected a

471
00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:30.452
that. After all, the US eluted a
black

472
00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:31.785
that. After all, the US elected a
black president, but it’s a work in

473
00:16:31.785 --> 00:16:35.452
black president, but it’s a work in
progress. But it is work in progress

474
00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:36.952
progress. But it is work in progress
that we must put our shoulder behind

475
00:16:36.952 --> 00:16:39.452
that we must put our shoulder behind
to make sure that things do improve.

476
00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:43.702
ﬂ

477
00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:50.410
I have got one more question, given
what is happening these days, we

478
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.452
what is happening these days, we
really wanted to discuss the issue

479
00:16:51.452 --> 00:16:53.244
really wanted to discuss the issue
of race at the beginning of this

480
00:16:53.244 --> 00:16:54.952
of race at the beginning of this
programme and we have got a

481
00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:56.994
programme and we have got a
different take on it from Ashya

482
00:16:56.994 --> 00:17:02.994
different take on it from Ashya
Roberts. Can we hear your question?

483
00:17:03.702 --> 00:17:03.910
Roberts. (“an we hear your question?
MY

484
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:04.369
Roberts. (“an we hear your question?
My question is

485
00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:04.994
Roberts. Can we hear your question?
My question is should the government

486
00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:10.702
My question is should the government
actively be doing more to

487
00:17:11.202 --> 00:17:11.744
actively be doing more to protect
peopla from

488
00:17:11.744 --> 00:17:12.160
actively be doing more to protect
people from ethnic minorities

489
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.327
peopla from ethnic minorities
against

490
00:17:12.327 --> 00:17:16.119
people from ethnic minorities
against the virus? We had a report

491
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.494
against the vims? We had a report
and you will be

492
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:18.952
against the virus? We had a report
and you will be familiar with this.

493
00:17:18.952 --> 00:17:21.535
and you will be familiar with this.
Age and sex are the biggest factors

494
00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:22.869
Age and sex are the biggest factors
when it comes to coronavirus. But

495
00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.410
when it comes to coronavirus. But
then you look at the Bangladeshi

496
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.327
then you look at the Bangladeshi
ethnicity, that is double the death

497
00:17:29.327 --> 00:17:31.119
ethnicity, that is double the death
rate of coronavirus compared to the

498
00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:35.160
rate of coronavirus compared to the
white British and then other black

499
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.119
white British and then other black
Asian and minority ethnic groups

500
00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:39.327
Asian and minority ethnic groups
tend to 50% more at risk. Is there

501
00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:39.702
tend to 5096 more at risk. Is there
more that

502
00:17:39.702 --> 00:17:44.410
tend to 50% more at risk. Is there
more that can be done in terms of

503
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:44.785
more that ran be done in terms of
staff, for

504
00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:45.577
more that can be done in terms of
staff, for example? Is there more

505
00:17:45.577 --> 00:17:45.910
staff, for exampla? Is there more
that ran

506
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.535
staff, for example? Is there more
that can be done to protect them as

507
00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:47.952
that ran be done to protect them as
opposed to

508
00:17:47.952 --> 00:17:50.202
that can be done to protect them as
opposed to their white counterparts?

509
00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.785
opposed to their white counterparts?
There has to be more that needs to

510
00:17:52.785 --> 00:17:53.994
There has to be more that needs to
be done. That whole report was

511
00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:56.202
be done. That whole report was
commissioned on the basis of the

512
00:17:56.202 --> 00:17:58.119
commissioned on the basis of the
question of why is this happening?

513
00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.327
question of why is this happening?
Yet we have had surveillance, we

514
00:18:00.327 --> 00:18:03.369
Yet we have had surveillance, we
have got statistics, but we have not

515
00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:03.785
have got statistic, but we have not
yet answered

516
00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:05.119
have got statistics, but we have not
yet answered why. Nobody expected an

517
00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:06.952
yet answered why. Nobody expected an
answer to come overnight, but surely

518
00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:09.244
answer to come overnight, but surely
there is much more we can do to

519
00:18:09.244 --> 00:18:09.494
there is much more we ran do to
protect nursing

520
00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:13.869
there is much more we can do to
protect nursing staff. I think there

521
00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:15.285
protect nursing staff. I think there
is something about adequate PPE and

522
00:18:15.285 --> 00:18:17.785
is something about adequate PPE and
I was on this programme not long ago

523
00:18:17.785 --> 00:18:20.660
I was on this programme not long ago
saying we needed the adequate PPE.

524
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.535
saying we needed the adequate PPE.
Are you getting that now? It is

525
00:18:24.535 --> 00:18:25.494
Are you getting that now? It is
still patchy. There are some

526
00:18:25.494 --> 00:18:27.494
still patchy. There are some
hospitals that are getting it, but

527
00:18:27.494 --> 00:18:29.994
hospitals that are getting it, but
we know many care homes are

528
00:18:29.994 --> 00:18:30.535
we know many rare homes are
stmggling to

529
00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:33.577
we know many care homes are
struggling to receive PPE. We also

530
00:18:33.577 --> 00:18:33.744
stmggling to receive PPE. We also
know

531
00:18:33.744 --> 00:18:35.119
struggling to receive PPE. We also
know that those district nurses are

532
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:38.660
know that those district nurses are
still struggling to get proper PPE.

533
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.119
still stmggling to get proper PPE.
It is

534
00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.410
still struggling to get proper PPE.
It is interesting that we have had

535
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.035
It is interesting that we have had
the latest announcement about face

536
00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:45.035
the latest announcement about face
coverings. . .

537
00:18:45.035 --> 00:18:45.744
the latest announcement about face
coverings... Face coverings on

538
00:18:45.744 --> 00:18:45.910
coverings... Face coverings on
pub“:

539
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.160
coverings... Face coverings on
public transport will be required

540
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.119
public transport will be required
from the 15th of

541
00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:50.577
public transport will be required
from the 15th ofJune. But we

542
00:18:50.577 --> 00:18:50.994
from the 15th of june. But we
struggle to

543
00:18:50.994 --> 00:18:52.327
from the 15th ofJune. But we
struggle to get nurses to have masks

544
00:18:52.327 --> 00:18:54.744
struggle to get nurses to have masks
when they are less than a metre away

545
00:18:54.744 --> 00:18:55.327
when they are less than a metre away
providing rare to

546
00:18:55.327 --> 00:18:56.202
when they are less than a metre away
providing care to patients. There

547
00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:56.952
providing rare to patients. There
has to be

548
00:18:56.952 --> 00:19:05.119
providing care to patients. There
has to be more. Do you think that

549
00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:07.660
has to be more. Do you think that
the main community nurses should be

550
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.619
the main community nurses should be
prioritised when it comes to the

551
00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:11.577
prioritised when it comes to the
stats that we know and the more at

552
00:19:11.577 --> 00:19:15.535
stats that we know and the more at
risk they are? We do not know from

553
00:19:15.535 --> 00:19:17.452
risk they are? We do not know from
this report whether it is linked to

554
00:19:17.452 --> 00:19:20.619
this report whether it is linked to
occupation or exposure. We know the

555
00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:21.744
occupation or exposure. We know the
viral load increases the more

556
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:26.369
viral load increases the more
exposed you are to the virus. Many

557
00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:26.744
exposed you are to the vims. Many
black, Asian

558
00:19:26.744 --> 00:19:28.577
exposed you are to the virus. Many
black, Asian and minority ethnic

559
00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:28.952
black, Asian and minority ethnic
peopla work

560
00:19:28.952 --> 00:19:31.119
black, Asian and minority ethnic
people work in front line

561
00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:33.244
people work in front line
conditions, most of our nurses are

562
00:19:33.244 --> 00:19:36.035
conditions, most of our nurses are
at band five delivering care, our

563
00:19:36.035 --> 00:19:36.535
at band five delivering rare, our
health

564
00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:37.660
at band five delivering care, our
health care assistance, and there

565
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.160
health rare assistance, and there
are many

566
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.494
health care assistance, and there
are many questions yet to be

567
00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:41.369
are many questions yet to be
answered. Obviously I am a public

568
00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:43.369
answered. Obviously I am a public
health nurse and I am looking for

569
00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:45.285
health nurse and I am looking for
protection before the answer occur.

570
00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:48.160
protection before the answer occur.
So as much protection that we can

571
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.035
So as much protection that we ran
give people is

572
00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:49.369
So as much protection that we can
give people is absolutely essential.

573
00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:51.702
give people is absolutely essential.
If that means that those with

574
00:19:51.702 --> 00:19:52.035
If that means that those with
undertying

575
00:19:52.035 --> 00:19:52.827
If that means that those with
underlying conditions are redeployed

576
00:19:52.827 --> 00:19:52.952
undertying conditions are redeployed
from

577
00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:56.327
underlying conditions are redeployed
from the front line, so be it. Their

578
00:19:56.327 --> 00:19:58.619
from the front line, so be it. Their
protection is hugely important. That

579
00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:00.369
protection is hugely important. That
goes to my concern about the

580
00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:03.577
goes to my concern about the
question that was as previously. I

581
00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.119
question that was as previously. I
stood on the front line trying to

582
00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:08.369
stood on the front line trying to
fight for patients permit lives a

583
00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:10.285
fight for patients permit lives a
few weeks ago and I do not want to

584
00:20:10.285 --> 00:20:12.577
few weeks ago and I do not want to
see that trash. I put my own life at

585
00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:14.119
see that trash. I put my own life at
risk and so have many other health

586
00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:14.244
risk and so have many other health
rare

587
00:20:14.244 --> 00:20:17.452
risk and so have many other health
care workers. We really wa nt

588
00:20:17.452 --> 00:20:17.702
risk and so have many other health
care workers. We really want people

589
00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:18.535
rare workers. We really want people
if they are

590
00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:19.327
care workers. We really want people
if they are protesting to observe

591
00:20:19.327 --> 00:20:20.910
if they are protesting to observe
social distancing because there is

592
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.785
social distancing because there is
no point in us coming back to look

593
00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:28.327
no point in us coming back to look
after them because of another cause.

594
00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:29.952
after them because of another cause.
11 weeks now we have had this look

595
00:20:29.952 --> 00:20:31.744
11 weeks now we have had this look
down and she is still seen people

596
00:20:31.744 --> 00:20:33.702
down and she is still seen people
who have not got PPE. How is that

597
00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:35.952
who have not got PPE. How is that
possibla? First

598
00:20:35.952 --> 00:20:36.744
who have not got PPE. How is that
possible? First of all, that should

599
00:20:36.744 --> 00:20:37.202
possibla? First of all, that should
not be

600
00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:41.952
possible? First of all, that should
not be happening. I can tell you

601
00:20:41.952 --> 00:20:42.494
not be happening. I ran tell you
from my own

602
00:20:42.494 --> 00:20:45.744
not be happening. I can tell you
from my own local experience, both

603
00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:45.952
from my own [oral experience, both
rare

604
00:20:45.952 --> 00:20:47.119
from my own local experience, both
care homes and the NHS, they have

605
00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:47.744
rare homes and the NHS, they have
got the PPE

606
00:20:47.744 --> 00:20:51.535
care homes and the NHS, they have
got the PPE that they need. That is

607
00:20:51.535 --> 00:20:53.910
got the PPE that they need. That is
OK, but it is 11 weeks on and I have

608
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.327
OK, but it is 11 weeks on and I have
had countless people from the

609
00:20:55.327 --> 00:20:56.660
had countless people from the
government saying we are sorting it,

610
00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.994
government saying we are sorting it,
we are getting it out next weekend,

611
00:20:58.994 --> 00:21:01.202
we are getting it out next weekend,
all the lorries are on the way, it

612
00:21:01.202 --> 00:21:03.910
all the lorries are on the way, it
is not a question of supply, it is

613
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.035
is not a question of supply, it is
logistic,

614
00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:05.077
is not a question of supply, it is
logistics, which turned out not to

615
00:21:05.077 --> 00:21:06.202
logistic, which turned out not to
be the

616
00:21:06.202 --> 00:21:08.202
logistics, which turned out not to
be the case in the end, how are we

617
00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:09.244
be the use in the end, how are we
11 weeks on,

618
00:21:09.244 --> 00:21:10.202
be the case in the end, how are we
11 weeks on, Donna is sitting there,

619
00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:12.452
11 weeks on, Donna is sitting there,
and we still have not got PPE where

620
00:21:12.452 --> 00:21:12.619
and we still have not got PPE where
peopla

621
00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:17.535
and we still have not got PPE where
people need it? Both the experience

622
00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:17.994
people need it? Both the experience
[orally and

623
00:21:17.994 --> 00:21:19.535
people need it? Both the experience
locally and nationally with the PPE

624
00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:19.744
[orally and nationally with the PPE
is

625
00:21:19.744 --> 00:21:21.160
locally and nationally with the PPE
is there. In Warwickshire it is

626
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.119
is there. In Warwickshire it is
therefore any care home as they

627
00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:23.285
therefore any rare home as they
asked

628
00:21:23.285 --> 00:21:24.994
therefore any care home as they
asked for. That is all very well.

629
00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:28.577
asked for. That is all very well.
You have heard Donna’s experience. I

630
00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:30.952
You have heard Donna’s experience. I
am trying to answer the question.

631
00:21:30.952 --> 00:21:32.910
am trying to answer the question.
Don had a specific example and I

632
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.494
Don had a specific example and I
will take that away and look at it

633
00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:36.744
will take that away and look at it
because that should not be

634
00:21:36.744 --> 00:21:38.160
because that should not be
happening. What I will say in answer

635
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.285
happening. what I will say in answer
to your

636
00:21:39.285 --> 00:21:40.327
happening. What I will say in answer
to your question is a couple of

637
00:21:40.327 --> 00:21:43.202
to your question is a couple of
things. Professor

638
00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:43.869
to your question is a couple of
things. ProfessorJohn Newton, the

639
00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:45.077
things. Professor john Newton, the
expert on this,

640
00:21:45.077 --> 00:21:46.494
things. ProfessorJohn Newton, the
expert on this, said that now that

641
00:21:46.494 --> 00:21:47.994
expert on this, said that now that
we have got the report the first

642
00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:50.077
we have got the report the first
thing that will happen is NHS

643
00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:52.327
thing that will happen is NHS
England is getting it out to the NHS

644
00:21:52.327 --> 00:21:52.494
England is getting it out to the NHS
tmsts

645
00:21:52.494 --> 00:21:55.035
England is getting it out to the NHS
trusts so they all have the data in

646
00:21:55.035 --> 00:21:58.660
trusts so they all have the data in
front of them. Secondly, equalities

647

sure that whatever we do we follow

649
00:22:03.244 --> 00:22:06.244
sure that whatever we do we follow
the report findings and effectively

650
00:22:06.244 --> 00:22:09.327
the report findings and effectively
take that and translate that into

651
00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:11.285
take that and translate that into
actions that we will take to make

652
00:22:11.285 --> 00:22:15.119
actions that we will take to make
sure actually people of black, Asian

653
00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.660
sure actually peopla of black, Asian
and minority

654
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.535
sure actually people of black, Asian
and minority ethnic backgrounds are

655
00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:20.952
and minority ethnic backgrounds are
protected. Hugh Pennington. The

656
00:22:20.952 --> 00:22:24.160
protected. Hugh Pennington. The
report was disappointing in the fact

657
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.952
report was disappointing in the fact
it did not come out with answers as

658
00:22:26.952 --> 00:22:27.577
it did not come out with answers as
to why peopla

659
00:22:27.577 --> 00:22:28.119
it did not come out with answers as
to why people from Bangladesh are

660
00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:28.494
to why peopla from Bangladesh are
more likely

661
00:22:28.494 --> 00:22:29.494
to why people from Bangladesh are
more likely to die from this virus

662
00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:34.494
more likely to die from this virus
than other people of other different

663
00:22:34.494 --> 00:22:36.160
than other people of other different
ethnic backgrounds. I can understand

664
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.577
ethnic backgrounds. I ran understand
why, to drill

665
00:22:37.577 --> 00:22:38.952
ethnic backgrounds. I can understand
why, to drill down to the data you

666
00:22:38.952 --> 00:22:41.035
why, to drill down to the data you
have to look at patients’ hospital

667
00:22:41.035 --> 00:22:41.244
have to look at patients“ hospital
records

668
00:22:41.244 --> 00:22:43.244
have to look at patients’ hospital
records to look at their particular

669
00:22:43.244 --> 00:22:45.244
records to look at their particular
circumstances. I sincerely hope that

670
00:22:45.244 --> 00:22:46.535
circumstances. I sincerely hope that
is proceeding with pace because that

671
00:22:46.535 --> 00:22:49.577
is proceeding with pace because that
will be quite a long task. It will

672
00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:52.035
will be quite a long task. It will
take a long time to do. I do this

673
00:22:52.035 --> 00:22:54.035
take a long time to do. I do this
sort of thing for medical and legal

674
00:22:54.035 --> 00:22:56.785
sort of thing for medical and legal
work and it is very time consuming.

675
00:22:56.785 --> 00:22:58.244
work and it is very time consuming.
However, it has to be done because

676
00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:01.035
However, it has to be done because
we want to find out what is going

677
00:23:01.035 --> 00:23:02.077
we want to find out what is going
wrong. why

678
00:23:02.077 --> 00:23:03.535
we want to find out what is going
wrong. Why are people, say from

679
00:23:03.535 --> 00:23:03.702
wrong. why are peopla, say from
Bangladesh,

680
00:23:03.702 --> 00:23:04.994
wrong. Why are people, say from
Bangladesh, because they were at the

681
00:23:04.994 --> 00:23:07.035
Bangladesh, because they were at the
top of the list in terms of

682
00:23:07.035 --> 00:23:09.827
top of the list in terms of
mortality, why are they in that

683
00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:11.494
mortality, why are they in that
group? We cannot understand it. We

684
00:23:11.494 --> 00:23:14.785
group? We cannot understand it. We
don’t know. Is it something to do

685
00:23:14.785 --> 00:23:18.119
don’t know. Is it something to do
with lifestyle? Housing?

686
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.494
with lifestyle? Housing?
Deprivation? Occupation? We cannot

687
00:23:20.494 --> 00:23:23.327
Deprivation? Occupation? We cannot
say. It is possible, that data is

688
00:23:23.327 --> 00:23:25.910
say. It is possible, that data is
out there, but it will be difficult

689
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.202
out there, but it will be difficult
to accumulate it. We want to get

690
00:23:27.202 --> 00:23:29.202
to accumulate it. We want to get
that right now because the virus has

691
00:23:29.202 --> 00:23:32.869
that right now because the virus has
not gone away. All these groups of

692
00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.327
not gone away. All these groups of
people with high mortality rates,

693
00:23:34.327 --> 00:23:34.744
peopla with high mortality rates,
that is

694
00:23:34.744 --> 00:23:34.910
people with high mortality rates,
that is a

695
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:35.119
peopla with high mortality rates,
that is a very

696
00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:39.077
people with high mortality rates,
that is a very strong measure, you

697
00:23:39.077 --> 00:23:39.952
that is a very strong measure, you
rannot laugh

698
00:23:39.952 --> 00:23:40.952
that is a very strong measure, you
cannot laugh that off, of course

699
00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:44.077
cannot laugh that off, of course
not, it is rightly important that

700
00:23:44.077 --> 00:23:46.077
not, it is rightly important that
while the virus persists we must do

701
00:23:46.077 --> 00:23:47.535
while the virus persists we must do
something to protect people who are

702
00:23:47.535 --> 00:23:48.077
something to protect peopla who are
more at

703
00:23:48.077 --> 00:23:50.285
something to protect people who are
more at risk in terms of having a

704
00:23:50.285 --> 00:23:52.785
more at risk in terms of having a
very serious infection and dying

705
00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:55.160
very serious infection and dying
from it. It is a no—brainer. We have

706
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:55.910
from it. It is a no-brainer. We have
got to get that

707
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.327
from it. It is a no—brainer. We have
got to get that work done. If you

708
00:23:59.327 --> 00:24:01.327
got to get that work done. If you
have to hire 20 PhD students to go

709
00:24:01.327 --> 00:24:02.452
have to hire 20 PhD students to go
through the notes, we should be

710
00:24:02.452 --> 00:24:06.244
through the notes, we should be
doing it right now. Kieran, you have

711
00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:10.494
doing it right now. Kieran, you have
got your hand up. In light of the

712
00:24:10.494 --> 00:24:12.535
got your hand up. In light of the
recent report is it safe for

713
00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:14.119
recent report is it safe for
children to now return to school and

714
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.660
children to now return to school and
workers to return to work from the

715
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.244
workers to return to work from the
ethnic minorities? This is what it

716
00:24:19.244 --> 00:24:22.369
ethnic minorities? This is what it
comes down to. The question from

717
00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:25.035
comes down to. The question from
Ashya Roberts is what should the

718
00:24:25.035 --> 00:24:29.035
Ashya Roberts is what should the
government do to protect people?

719
00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:29.285
government do to protect people?
where

720
00:24:29.285 --> 00:24:31.035
government do to protect people?
Where do the results of that report

721
00:24:31.035 --> 00:24:31.285
where do the results of that report
takers?

722
00:24:31.285 --> 00:24:32.452
Where do the results of that report
takers? Does it take us down the

723
00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:38.244
takers? Does it take us down the
route of if you are from the BAME

724
00:24:38.244 --> 00:24:40.160
route of if you are from the BAME
community, should the lockdown be

725
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:40.452
community, should the lockdown be
tighter for

726
00:24:40.452 --> 00:24:41.119
community, should the lockdown be
tighterfor you?

727
00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:41.535
community, should the lockdown be
tighterforyou? Is

728
00:24:41.535 --> 00:24:41.785
community, should the lockdown be
tighterfor you? Is that

729
00:24:41.785 --> 00:24:41.994
community, should the lockdown be
tighter for you? Is that even

730
00:24:41.994 --> 00:24:44.119
tighter for you? Is that even
remotely acceptable to think that?

731
00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:45.619
remotely acceptable to think that?
Should there be certain jobs you

732
00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:46.119
Should there be certainjobs you
should

733
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:48.119
Should there be certain jobs you
should not be going back to? Or

734
00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:50.327
should not be going back to? Or
children not going back to school?

735
00:24:50.327 --> 00:24:51.327
children not going back to school?
Treating people differently because

736
00:24:51.327 --> 00:24:55.619
Treating people differently because
of their ethnic background? Let’s be

737
00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:57.494
of their ethnic background? Let’s be
clear, right across black and Asian

738
00:24:57.494 --> 00:24:59.160
clear, right across black and Asian
communities in this country there is

739
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.577
communities in this country there is
fear and anxiety. It is now getting

740
00:25:01.577 --> 00:25:03.452
fear and anxiety. It is now getting
to the stage where it is hard not to

741
00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:06.244
to the stage where it is hard not to
know someone who has died. I have

742

now want recommendations. They want
risk assessments at work

774
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.535
risk assessments at work
particularly because we are talking

particularty because we are talking
about a

776
00:25:53.202 --> 00:25:54.410
particularly because we are talking
about a community of people who

about a community of peopla who
arrived

778
00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:55.910
about a community of people who
arrived from Asia and the Caribbean

779
00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:00.160
arrived from Asia and the Caribbean
who came to work in public services,

780
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.202
who came to work in public services,
the NHS, post offices, our transport

781
00:26:02.202 --> 00:26:05.619
the NHS, post offices, our transport
system, London underground. They

782
00:26:05.619 --> 00:26:06.785
system, London underground. They
come into contact with many people

783
00:26:06.785 --> 00:26:07.119
come into contact with many peopla
and we

784
00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:12.327
come into contact with many people
and we have no answers. I say to

785
00:26:12.327 --> 00:26:14.160
and we have no answers. I say to
Nadeem, I don’t want to say it in an

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:14.327
Nadeem, I don’t want to say it in an
angry

787
00:26:14.327 --> 00:26:14.577
Nadeem, I don’t want to say it in an
5"ng WY-

788
00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:16.494
Nadeem, I don’t want to say it in an
angry way, but I say we need action

789
00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:16.910
angry way, but I say we need action
now, not

790
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.077
angry way, but I say we need action
now, notjust

791
00:26:17.077 --> 00:26:18.160
angry way, but I say we need action
now, not just the

792
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:18.577
angry way, but I say we need action
now, notjust the rhetoric about

793
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:18.785
angry way, but I say we need action
now, not just the rhetoric about all

794
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:21.869
now, not just the rhetoric about all
this is terrible, but where we have

795
00:26:21.869 --> 00:26:22.494
this is terribla, but where we have
had

796
00:26:22.494 --> 00:26:23.744
this is terrible, but where we have
had guidelines and rules for others,

797
00:26:23.744 --> 00:26:24.077
had guidelines and mles for others,
ran we

798
00:26:24.077 --> 00:26:25.327
had guidelines and rules for others,
can we now have some to protect and

799
00:26:25.327 --> 00:26:28.035
ran we now have some to protect and
save lives?

800
00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:29.910
can we now have some to protect and
save lives? If protecting the NHS

801
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.827
save lives? If protecting the NHS
and saving lives means something, it

802
00:26:31.827 --> 00:26:34.035
and saving lives means something, it
has to mean something also for black

803
00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:35.327
has to mean something also for black
and ethnic minorities in our own

804
00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:41.119
and ethnic minorities in our own
country. And to Kieran’s question.

805
00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:41.494
country. And to Kieran’s question.
801: of

806
00:26:41.494 --> 00:26:42.410
country. And to Kieran’s question.
80% of schools

807
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.494
country. And to Kieran’s question.
80% of schools remained open to make

808
00:26:44.494 --> 00:26:45.744
8096 of schools remained open to make
sure that

809
00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:47.035
80% of schools remained open to make
sure that the critical workers, the

810
00:26:47.035 --> 00:26:48.577
sure that the critical workers, the
front line workers, and those

811
00:26:48.577 --> 00:26:50.327
front line workers, and those
children who are in need could

812
00:26:50.327 --> 00:26:54.660
children who are in need could
actually still get to school. We are

813
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.035
actually still get to school. We are
very slowly, deliberately slowly,

814
00:26:56.035 --> 00:26:58.285
very slowly, deliberately slowly,
asking schools to return for the

815
00:26:58.285 --> 00:27:00.660
asking schools to return for the
earty years

816
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.452
asking schools to return for the
early years and of course year one

817
00:27:02.452 --> 00:27:03.285
earty years and of course year one
and six as

818
00:27:03.285 --> 00:27:04.660
early years and of course year one
and six as well. No, that is not

819
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.035
and six as well. No, that is not
what Kieran was talking about. I

820
00:27:07.035 --> 00:27:09.244
what Kieran was talking about. I
want to get to the... We have only

821
00:27:09.244 --> 00:27:13.452
want to get to the... We have only
got a limited time. You cannot have

822
00:27:13.452 --> 00:27:16.910
got a limited time. You cannot have
half an answer. You need to answer

823
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:17.952
half an answer. You need to answer
the question. Kieran’s point is

824
00:27:17.952 --> 00:27:18.744
the question. Kieran’s point is
should

825
00:27:18.744 --> 00:27:22.119
the question. Kieran’s point is
should children from black and Asian

826
00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:24.785
should children from black and Asian
minority and ethnic communities go

827
00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:27.327
minority and ethnic communities go
to school because of that? I was

828
00:27:27.327 --> 00:27:31.327
to school because of that? I was
about to say, if you allow me... I

829
00:27:31.327 --> 00:27:35.702
about to say, if you allow me... I
am all ears. If we all follow the

830
00:27:35.702 --> 00:27:38.119
am all ears. If we all follow the
social distancing rules, we have

831
00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:38.994
social distancing mles, we have
issued

832
00:27:38.994 --> 00:27:40.910
social distancing rules, we have
issued guidelines across education,

833
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.327
issued guidelines across education,
the environment, construction, the

834
00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:43.494
the environment, constmction, the
warehouses,

835
00:27:43.494 --> 00:27:44.452
the environment, construction, the
warehouses, if you follow the rules

836
00:27:44.452 --> 00:27:46.494
warehouses, if you follow the mles
and socially

837
00:27:46.494 --> 00:27:47.285
warehouses, if you follow the rules
and socially distance and you wash

838
00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:49.619
and socially distance and you wash
your hands, you will be safe and we

839
00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:53.119
your hands, you will be safe and we
will continue to bear down. Whew,

840
00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:53.619
will continue to bear down. when,
you wanted to

841
00:27:53.619 --> 00:27:57.369
will continue to bear down. Whew,
you wanted to come in. One thing we

842
00:27:57.369 --> 00:27:59.660
you wanted to come in. One thing we
ran say pretty

843
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.244
you wanted to come in. One thing we
can say pretty certainly from the

844
00:28:00.244 --> 00:28:00.452
ran say pretty certainly from the
Pub“:

845
00:28:00.452 --> 00:28:04.869
can say pretty certainly from the
Public Health England report is that

846
00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:06.327
Public Health England report is that
children and anybody under 20 has a

847
00:28:06.327 --> 00:28:08.827
children and anybody under 20 has a
very low risk of having any kind of

848
00:28:08.827 --> 00:28:11.285
very low risk of having any kind of
serious illness with this virus.

849
00:28:11.285 --> 00:28:11.619
serious illness with this vims.
This very

850
00:28:11.619 --> 00:28:13.327
serious illness with this virus.
This very small group of younger

851
00:28:13.327 --> 00:28:20.035
This very small group of younger
children with Kawasaki

852
00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:23.119
children with Kawasaki syndrome,
they are at risk, but that is very

853
00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:28.327
they are at risk, but that is very
rare. Young children do not fall ill

854
00:28:28.327 --> 00:28:30.702
rare. Young children do not fall ill
in the first place. This is a

855
00:28:30.702 --> 00:28:32.577
in the first place. This is a
peculiar virus because there is a

856
00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.327
peculiar virus because there is a
very strong relationship between age

857
00:28:34.327 --> 00:28:37.077
very strong relationship between age
and having a bad outcome. Those over

858
00:28:37.077 --> 00:28:39.494
and having a bad outcome. Those over
80 or 70 times more likely to die

859
00:28:39.494 --> 00:28:41.119
80 or 70 times more likely to die
than peopla in

860
00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.077
80 or 70 times more likely to die
than people in their 405. That is an

861
00:28:43.077 --> 00:28:43.327
than peopla in their 405. That is an
enormously

862
00:28:43.327 --> 00:28:43.702
than people in their 40s. That is an
enormously impressive statistic

863
00:28:43.702 --> 00:28:46.244
enormously impressive statistic
which does not happen with any other

864
00:28:46.244 --> 00:28:47.285
which does not happen with any other
vims. I

865
00:28:47.285 --> 00:28:47.494
which does not happen with any other
vims. Iran

866
00:28:47.494 --> 00:28:48.119
which does not happen with any other
vims. I ran put

867
00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:49.035
which does not happen with any other
virus. I can put that in as

868
00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:50.035
virus. I can put that in as
reassurance that children will not

869
00:28:50.035 --> 00:28:52.077
reassurance that children will not
get a serious illness and they will

870
00:28:52.077 --> 00:28:54.577
get a serious illness and they will
not have complications and so on.

871
00:28:54.577 --> 00:28:56.702
not have complications and so on.
But one question that has not been

872
00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:58.035
But one question that has not been
answered is are they going to get

873
00:28:58.035 --> 00:29:02.952
answered is are they going to get
the virus and take it home and in

874
00:29:02.952 --> 00:29:04.535
the virus and take it home and in
fact their parents and their

875
00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:05.827
fact their parents and their
grandparents? That is something that

876
00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:08.119
grandparents? That is something that
is still not certain. It does not

877
00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:09.994
is still not certain. It does not
look very likely, but, but, you

878
00:29:09.994 --> 00:29:13.077
look very likely, but, but, you
cannot rule it out. Let’s take

879
00:29:13.077 --> 00:29:13.285
cannot mla it out. Let’s take
another

880
00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:14.327
cannot rule it out. Let’s take
another question from Lorraine

881
00:29:14.327 --> 00:29:17.535
another question from Lorraine
jones.

882
00:29:17.535 --> 00:29:19.369
another question from Lorraine
Jones. Doesn’t the 1A day quarantine

883
00:29:19.369 --> 00:29:19.827
jones. Doesn’t the 14 day quarantine
for incoming

884
00:29:19.827 --> 00:29:21.077
Jones. Doesn’t the 1A day quarantine
for incoming travellers to the UK

885
00:29:21.077 --> 00:29:23.035
for incoming travellers to the UK
seem pointless when we are mostly

886
00:29:23.035 --> 00:29:24.952
seem pointless when we are mostly
lagging behind the other European

887
00:29:24.952 --> 00:29:27.035
lagging behind the other European
countries in getting control of the

888
00:29:27.035 --> 00:29:27.452
countries in getting control of the
vims as

889
00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:29.119
countries in getting control of the
virus as the main EU countries now

890
00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:30.327
virus as the main EU countries now
have a lower transmission rate than

891
00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:34.744
have a lower transmission rate than
the UK? That is the point, is this a

892
00:29:34.744 --> 00:29:34.869
the UK? That is the point, is this a
use

893
00:29:34.869 --> 00:29:35.285
the UK? That is the point, is this a
rase of shutting

894
00:29:35.285 --> 00:29:37.327
the UK? That is the point, is this a
case of shutting the stable door

895
00:29:37.327 --> 00:29:37.577
rase of shutting the stable door
after

896
00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:39.119
case of shutting the stable door
after the horse has bolted? When

897
00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:39.494
after the horse has bolted? when
other

898
00:29:39.494 --> 00:29:40.410
after the horse has bolted? When
other countries had a higher

899
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.619
other countries had a higher
infection rate we were letting them

900
00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:44.202
infection rate we were letting them
in and we still are, you can still

901
00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:44.619
in and we still are, you ran still
come in

902
00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:47.119
in and we still are, you can still
come in from Brazil, from New York,

903
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.327
come in from Brazil, from New York,
but now we are talking about

904
00:29:48.327 --> 00:29:50.869
but now we are talking about
stopping countries. In the case of

905
00:29:50.869 --> 00:29:51.452
stopping countries. In the rase of
Europe they

906
00:29:51.452 --> 00:29:52.785
stopping countries. In the case of
Europe they have all got a lower

907
00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:58.035
Europe they have all got a lower
infection rates than we have.

908
00:29:58.035 --> 00:30:00.910
It’s an important question. When

909
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.035
It’s an important question. when
this virus

910
00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:02.910
It’s an important question. When
this virus was in the containment

911
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.910
this virus was in the containment
phase, when we could contain it, it

912
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:09.327
phase, when we could contain it, it
was right that we introduced

913
00:30:09.327 --> 00:30:10.035
was right that we introduced
quarantine and effectively dealing

914
00:30:10.035 --> 00:30:12.744
quarantine and effectively dealing
with people coming from Li Wenliang

915
00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:13.160
with peopla coming from Li Wenliang
and the

916
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.202
with people coming from Li Wenliang
and the rest of China in early

917
00:30:15.202 --> 00:30:16.827
and the rest of China in earty
january. But

918
00:30:16.827 --> 00:30:17.660
and the rest of China in early
January. But we let everybody else

919
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.369
january. But we let everybody else
come. As

920
00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:22.494
January. But we let everybody else
come. As it turned out, the Italians

921
00:30:22.494 --> 00:30:24.035
come. As it turned out, the Italians
and the Spanish had a huge infection

922
00:30:24.035 --> 00:30:27.952
and the Spanish had a huge infection
rate but we let them come in. We

923
00:30:27.952 --> 00:30:29.494
rate but we let them come in. We
didn’t, because we stop people

924
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.952
didn’t, because we stop people
coming from northern Italy and then

925
00:30:30.952 --> 00:30:33.285
coming from northern Italy and then
the whole of Italy, we did the same

926
00:30:33.285 --> 00:30:35.119
the whole of Italy, we did the same
for Iran and Japan and, early on,

927
00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:35.327
for Iran and japan and, earty on,
from

928
00:30:35.327 --> 00:30:37.119
for Iran and Japan and, early on,
from Wuhan and the whole of China.

929
00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:37.452
from Wuhan and the whola of China.
when we

930
00:30:37.452 --> 00:30:38.577
from Wuhan and the whole of China.
When we went from containment to

931
00:30:38.577 --> 00:30:39.077
when we went from containment to
delay, when

932
00:30:39.077 --> 00:30:41.577
When we went from containment to
delay, when the virus was already

933
00:30:41.577 --> 00:30:44.827
delay, when the virus was already
spreading through our communities,

934
00:30:44.827 --> 00:30:46.702
spreading through our communities,
the scientists and the advice was to

935
00:30:46.702 --> 00:30:50.244
the scientists and the advice was to
say, actually, there is almost no

936
00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:52.910
say, actually, there is almost no
difference of actually doing

937
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.410
difference of actually doing
anything at ports and airports. But

938
00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.535
anything at ports and airports. But
now they are not advising you to

939
00:30:59.535 --> 00:31:03.494
now they are not advising you to
introduce quarantine, are they? Or

940
00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:04.660
introduce quarantine, are they? Or
the advice now is, when infection

941
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.160
the advice now is, when infection
rates are low and coming down even

942
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.410
rates are low and coming down even
further, the risk from a spike from

943
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.535
further, the risk from a spike from
outside the UK is much higher, which

944
00:31:12.535 --> 00:31:13.994
outside the UK is much higher, which
is why we have introduced the

945
00:31:13.994 --> 00:31:16.494
is why we have introduced the
quarantine. We’ve also introduced a

946
00:31:16.494 --> 00:31:18.910
quarantine. We’ve also introduced a
review of it every three weeks so we

947
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.160
review of it every three weeks so we
make sure we are able to

948
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.202
make sure we are able to
effectively, for example, and this

949
00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:24.077
effectively, for example, and this
has been talked about, look at other

950
00:31:24.077 --> 00:31:25.785
has been talked about, look at other
countries and build air bridges to

951
00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:29.494
countries and build air bridges to
save countries, and that is an

952
00:31:29.494 --> 00:31:31.744
save countries, and that is an
important part of this. All of these

953
00:31:31.744 --> 00:31:33.285
important part of this. All of these
decisions are really difficult but

954
00:31:33.285 --> 00:31:36.285
decisions are really difficult but
actually, when the virus is low and

955
00:31:36.285 --> 00:31:37.494
actually, when the virus is low and
coming down even further, it’s the

956
00:31:37.494 --> 00:31:39.369
coming down even further, it’s the
right thing to do to not allow

957
00:31:39.369 --> 00:31:39.785
right thing to do to not allow
peopla to

958
00:31:39.785 --> 00:31:40.369
right thing to do to not allow
people to come in without

959
00:31:40.369 --> 00:31:47.202
people to come in without
quarantine. David. It’s got to be

960
00:31:47.202 --> 00:31:51.827
quarantine. David. It’s got to be
based on the science. The WHA set

961
00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:52.910
based on the science. The WHA set
back in February, quarantine was

Now we have a situation where we

974
00:32:15.744 --> 00:32:17.494
Now we have a situation where we
know 40,000 have died from Covid

975
00:32:17.494 --> 00:32:19.910
know 40,000 have died from Covid
but, if you look at the year—on—year

976
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:20.410
but, if you look at the year-on-year
figures, its

977
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.285
but, if you look at the year—on—year
figures, its 60,000 people have lost

978
00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:23.035
figures, its 60,000 peopla have lost
over this

979
00:32:23.035 --> 00:32:24.077
figures, its 60,000 people have lost
over this period stop we have got

980
00:32:24.077 --> 00:32:27.577
over this period stop we have got
the worst rate, in fact, we have a

981
00:32:27.577 --> 00:32:29.702
the worst rate, in fact, we have a
higher rate and the whole of Europe

982
00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:30.660
higher rate and the whole of Europe
combined and now we are

983
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.535
combined and now we are
quarantining? This feels like late.

984
00:32:33.535 --> 00:32:35.035
quarantining? This feels like late.
We were late on the lockdown, late

985
00:32:35.035 --> 00:32:38.910
We were late on the lockdown, late
on the testing, late on the PPE and

986
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.535
on the testing, late on the PPE and
we are late again on quarantine. I

987
00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:45.785
we are late again on quarantine. I
would listen to you if you didn’t

988
00:32:45.785 --> 00:32:47.369
would listen to you if you didn’t
quote an inaccurate stat which was

989
00:32:47.369 --> 00:32:53.119
quote an inaccurate stat which was
been proven to be wrong. If we used

990
00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:55.452
been proven to be wrong. If we used
the same scale of measure is fame we

991
00:32:55.452 --> 00:32:57.077
the same scale of measure is fame we
would have reported only 20 deaths

992
00:32:57.077 --> 00:32:58.452
would have reported only 20 deaths
yesterday, and I’m sure the BBC at

993
00:32:58.452 --> 00:33:02.494
yesterday, and I’m sure the BBC at
some point... Is there a country in

994
00:33:02.494 --> 00:33:03.827
some point... Is there a country in
Europe with a higher death rate than

995
00:33:03.827 --> 00:33:08.160
Europe with a higher death rate than
us? Every death is a regrettable

996
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:08.410
us? Every death is a regrettable
thing. I

997
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:08.827
us? Every death is a regrettable
thing. lam not

998
00:33:08.827 --> 00:33:09.119
us? Every death is a regrettable
thing. I am not sitting

999
00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:09.702
us? Every death is a regrettable
thing. lam not sitting here

1000
00:33:09.702 --> 00:33:09.785
us? Every death is a regrettable
thing. I am not sitting here saying

1001
00:33:09.785 --> 00:33:10.452
thing. lam not sitting here saying
to you that

1002
00:33:10.452 --> 00:33:11.285
thing. I am not sitting here saying
to you that everything we have done

1003
00:33:11.285 --> 00:33:13.035
to you that everything we have done
we have done well but, at the end of

1004
00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:16.119
we have done well but, at the end of
this crisis, we will learn the

1005
00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.244
this crisis, we will learn the
lessons, because it’s only right we

1006
00:33:17.244 --> 00:33:18.869
lessons, because it’s only right we
look at this, and we are trying to

1007
00:33:18.869 --> 00:33:21.285
look at this, and we are trying to
be as transparent as we can, but

1008
00:33:21.285 --> 00:33:21.910
be as transparent as we ran, but
it’s wrong to

1009
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.660
be as transparent as we can, but
it’s wrong to quote figures that are

1010
00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:29.202
it’s wrong to quote figures that are
completely spurious. Get a grip! We

1011
00:33:29.202 --> 00:33:31.202
completely spurious. Get a grip! We
are languishing globally. We are a

1012
00:33:31.202 --> 00:33:32.160
are languishing globally. We are a
laughing stock. People have died.

1013
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.202
laughing stock. People have died.
It’s horrendous. People can’t

1014
00:33:35.202 --> 00:33:37.660
It’s horrendous. People can’t
believe that Britain is so behind

1015
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.994
believe that Britain is so behind
the curve globally, because we have

1016
00:33:38.994 --> 00:33:42.785
the curve globally, because we have
been slow and dithering. It is

1017
00:33:42.785 --> 00:33:43.910
been slow and dithering. It is
disappointing you are making this a

1018
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.160
disappointing you are making this a
partisan point in the way care

1019
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.744
partisan point in the way care

Starmer. I want you to succeed

1021
00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:55.660
Starmer. I want you to succeed
because I don’t want more people to

1022
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.869
because I don’t want more peopla to
die, but... Is

1023
00:33:58.869 --> 00:33:59.035
because I don’t want more peopla to
die, but... Isto

1024
00:33:59.035 --> 00:33:59.827
because I don’t want more people to
die, but... Is to then take away the

1025
00:33:59.827 --> 00:34:01.619
die, but... Is to then take away the
inaccuracies and tell the truth and

1026
00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:02.744
inaccuracies and tell the truth and
don’t quote the BBC, which were

1027
00:34:02.744 --> 00:34:04.785
don’t quote the BBC, which were
wrong last night, I hope they will

1028
00:34:04.785 --> 00:34:09.035
wrong last night, I hope they will
correct it tonight.

1029
00:34:09.035 --> 00:34:10.327
correct it tonight.

16 cadets. There is no doubt. Even

1032
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.577
16 cadets. There is no doubt. Even
if the figures come out slightly

1033
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:18.827
if the figures come out slightly
higher in other countries we will

1034
00:34:18.827 --> 00:34:21.952
higher in other countries we will
still be an outlier. And we have to

1035
00:34:21.952 --> 00:34:25.035
still be an outlier. And we have to
learn the lessons. I am not proud of

1036
00:34:25.035 --> 00:34:25.452
learn the lassons. I am not proud of
that. We

1037
00:34:25.452 --> 00:34:28.869
learn the lessons. I am not proud of
that. We have to learn the lessons.

1038
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:30.244
that. We have to learn the lessons.
The Prime Minister said he was proud

The Prime Minister said he was proud
of our record. Custom I’m not proud

of our record. Custom I’m not proud
of the deaths. I’m proud of our

a day to day. I’m proud of the
record of the NHS and the amazing

record of the NHS and the amazing
front line workers who make sure the

continued to treat peopla. I am
proud of

continued to treat people. I am
proud of what we have done in the

proud of what we have done in the
Treasury to make sure that

from the furlough scheme. I am proud

1057
00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:08.327
from the furlough scheme. I am proud
of all of that. Donna, the question

1058
00:35:08.327 --> 00:35:09.619
of all of that. Donna, the question
is about quarantine. Is it pointless

1059
00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:13.994
is about quarantine. Is it pointless
now? It feels a bit late to me. I

1060
00:35:13.994 --> 00:35:16.744
now? It feels a bit late to me. I
will say that, on the 8th of March,

1061
00:35:16.744 --> 00:35:18.535
will say that, on the 8th of March,
I had a trip booked to Italy and I

1062
00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:20.660
I had a trip booked to Italy and I
didn’t go because I could see what

1063
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.494
didn’t go because I could see what
was happening in Italy, but I could

1064
00:35:22.494 --> 00:35:24.244
was happening in Italy, but I could
have gone and come back, and it was

1065
00:35:24.244 --> 00:35:28.285
have gone and come back, and it was
to Milan. And people from Italy

1066
00:35:28.285 --> 00:35:28.452
to Milan. And peopla from Italy
could

1067
00:35:28.452 --> 00:35:31.035
to Milan. And people from Italy
could come here first they were

1068
00:35:31.035 --> 00:35:32.160
could come here first they were
asked to self—isolate when they

1069
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.327
asked to self-isolate when they
arrived

1070
00:35:32.327 --> 00:35:36.410
asked to self—isolate when they
arrived but they could arrive. I

1071
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.369
arrived but they could arrive. I
chose to lose the money from my

1072
00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:39.077
chose to lose the money from my
ﬂight because

1073
00:35:39.077 --> 00:35:39.577
chose to lose the money from my
flight because it seemed pointless

1074
00:35:39.577 --> 00:35:40.327
ﬂight because it seemed pointless
to go and

1075
00:35:40.327 --> 00:35:41.285
flight because it seemed pointless
to go and contaminate and bring it

1076
00:35:41.285 --> 00:35:41.619
to go and contaminate and bring it
back, but

1077
00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:41.785
to go and contaminate and bring it
back, butl

1078
00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:43.827
to go and contaminate and bring it
back, but I feel we were a bit late

1079
00:35:43.827 --> 00:35:46.327
back, but I feel we were a bit late
to get to it. However, we are where

1080
00:35:46.327 --> 00:35:47.952
to get to it. However, we are where
we are, and the important thing is

1081
00:35:47.952 --> 00:35:51.244
we are, and the important thing is
that we do the right thing, so it

1082
00:35:51.244 --> 00:35:53.119
that we do the right thing, so it
isn’t about quarantine now, it’s

1083
00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:55.535
isn’t about quarantine now, it’s
about us complying with the

1084
00:35:55.535 --> 00:35:57.785
about us complying with the
standards, washing our hands, social

1085
00:35:57.785 --> 00:35:58.994
standards, washing our hands, social
distancing, doing the right things

1086
00:35:58.994 --> 00:36:00.077
distancing, doing the right things
to protect ourselves from this

1087
00:36:00.077 --> 00:36:01.327
to protect ourselves from this
vims.

1088
00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:03.494
to protect ourselves from this
virus. The virus hasn’t gone away.

1089
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:03.994
vims. The virus hasn’t gone away.
It’s still

1090
00:36:03.994 --> 00:36:04.869
virus. The virus hasn’t gone away.
It’s still virulent, we can all

1091
00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:05.285
It’s still virulant, we ran all
still

1092
00:36:05.285 --> 00:36:07.035
It’s still virulent, we can all
still catch it and we are where we

1093
00:36:07.035 --> 00:36:09.577
still catch it and we are where we
are. It’s a bit pointless, really,

1094
00:36:09.577 --> 00:36:11.869
are. It’s a bit pointless, really,
we look back in history, because

1095
00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.285
we look back in history, because
we’ve had 40,000 deaths now and the

1096
00:36:13.285 --> 00:36:14.869
we’ve had 40,000 deaths now and the
only thing we ran

1097
00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:15.494
we’ve had 40,000 deaths now and the
only thing we can do is protect

1098
00:36:15.494 --> 00:36:17.119
only thing we can do is protect
ourselves going forward, and that’s

1099
00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:18.327
ourselves going forward, and that’s
by complying with the science and

1100
00:36:18.327 --> 00:36:20.535
by complying with the science and
the guidance that we have. I think

1101
00:36:20.535 --> 00:36:24.369
the guidance that we have. I think
that’s the important thing now.

1102
00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:24.494
that’s the important thing now.
(lient

1103
00:36:24.494 --> 00:36:25.577
that’s the important thing now.
Client Lorraine wanted to come back

1104
00:36:25.577 --> 00:36:27.994
(lient Lorraine wanted to come back
in.

1105
00:36:27.994 --> 00:36:28.410
(1ient Lorraine wanted to come back
in. Seems

1106
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.619
Client Lorraine wanted to come back
in. Seems to me that we have missed

1107
00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:32.827
in. Seems to me that we have missed
the boat and, if we are going to

1108
00:36:32.827 --> 00:36:34.869
the boat and, if we are going to
quarantine, why wait until Monday

1109
00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:36.660
quarantine, why wait until Monday
before we put it in place if it was

1110
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.660
before we put it in place if it was
so important? Basically, up until

1111
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.327
so important? Basically, up until
Monday, people could still come in,

1112
00:36:42.327 --> 00:36:42.660
Monday, peopla could still come in,
so what’s

1113
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:48.244
Monday, people could still come in,
so what’s the point of it? Carrie.

1114
00:36:48.244 --> 00:36:50.952
so what’s the point of it? Carrie.
Thank you for letting me join the

1115
00:36:50.952 --> 00:36:51.660
Thank you for [citing me join the
I’ve got quite

1116
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.494
Thank you for letting me join the
I’ve got quite an important point to

1117
00:36:53.494 --> 00:36:55.785
I’ve got quite an important point to
make, as you were talking about

1118
00:36:55.785 --> 00:37:00.285
make, as you were talking about
stats and testing at R rate. We are

1119
00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:00.910
stats and testing at R rate. We are
specifically talking about

1120
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.660
specifically talking about
quarantine. 0K,

1121
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.494
specifically talking about
quarantine. OK, then I probably need

1122
00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:06.827
quarantine. OK, then I probably need
to rewind a bit. I was trying to

1123
00:37:06.827 --> 00:37:10.744
to rewind a bit. I was trying to
interject with David speaking I have

1124
00:37:10.744 --> 00:37:12.035
interject with David speaking I have
Covid and I’ve tested negative twice

1125
00:37:12.035 --> 00:37:18.827
Covid and I’ve tested negative twice
and been told from my bloods that I

1126
00:37:18.827 --> 00:37:20.827
and been told from my bloods that I
have it, and there is a 30% failure

1127
00:37:20.827 --> 00:37:21.202
have it, and there is a 3096 failure
rate with

1128
00:37:21.202 --> 00:37:23.327
have it, and there is a 30% failure
rate with the swabs, so we are

1129
00:37:23.327 --> 00:37:28.452
rate with the swabs, so we are
potentially missing 30 in 100 cases.

1130
00:37:28.452 --> 00:37:28.785
potentially missing 30 in 100 cases.
So how

1131
00:37:28.785 --> 00:37:30.619
potentially missing 30 in 100 cases.
50 how can we rely on those stats?

1132
00:37:30.619 --> 00:37:30.994
So how ran we rely on those stats?
where do

1133
00:37:30.994 --> 00:37:31.202
So how can we rely on those stats?
Where do we

1134
00:37:31.202 --> 00:37:31.410
So how ran we rely on those stats?
where do we go

1135
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.910
So how can we rely on those stats?
Where do we go with that? I think we

1136
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.452
where do we go with that? I think we
might come onto

1137
00:37:35.452 --> 00:37:37.327
Where do we go with that? I think we
might come onto testing later, so

1138
00:37:37.327 --> 00:37:38.910
might come onto testing later, so
I’m going to hold that thought, if

1139
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.744
I’m going to hold that thought, if
that’s all right. Thaddeus, you put

1140
00:37:40.744 --> 00:37:42.994
that’s all right. Thaddeus, you put
your hand up. I was

1141
00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:45.202
that’s all right. Thaddeus, you put
your hand up. I wasjust wondering,

1142
00:37:45.202 --> 00:37:48.619
your hand up. I was just wondering,
in any one

1143
00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:51.077
your hand up. I wasjust wondering,
in any one country,... Would they

1144
00:37:51.077 --> 00:37:54.410
in any one country,... Would they
let us travel there and travel back?

1145
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.410
let us travel there and travel back?
We have higher infection rates any

1146
00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:57.619
We have higher infection rates any
other country in Europe, but were

1147
00:37:57.619 --> 00:37:58.994
other country in Europe, but were
talking about not letting them come

1148
00:37:58.994 --> 00:37:59.160
talking about not latting them come
when

1149
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.035
talking about not letting them come
when it’s probably safer for

1150
00:38:02.035 --> 00:38:02.160
talking about not letting them come
when it’s probably saferfor them

1151
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.410
talking about not letting them come
when it’s probably safer for them to

1152
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.827
when it’s probably safer for them to
come here and not quarantine that it

1153
00:38:03.827 --> 00:38:05.619
come here and not quarantine that it
is for us to go there and infect

1154
00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:10.119
is for us to go there and infect
them. There are quite a few

1155
00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:11.702
them. There are quite a few
countries we can go to. Soon we can

1156
00:38:11.702 --> 00:38:12.660
countries we ran go to. Soon we ran
go to Italy to stop

1157
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.202
countries we can go to. Soon we can
go to Italy to stop we can go to

1158
00:38:14.202 --> 00:38:14.535
go to Italy to stop we ran go to
Portugal now,

1159
00:38:14.535 --> 00:38:15.285
go to Italy to stop we can go to
Portugal now, I think, possibly

1160
00:38:15.285 --> 00:38:19.785
Portugal now, I think, possibly
other countries. Whew. it’s a bit

1161
00:38:19.785 --> 00:38:20.035
other countries. whew. it’s a bit
academic

1162
00:38:20.035 --> 00:38:20.785
other countries. Whew. it’s a bit
academic because many countries will

1163
00:38:20.785 --> 00:38:22.952
academic because many countries will
not let us in because we have such a

1164
00:38:22.952 --> 00:38:26.285
not let us in because we have such a
high rate of infection. Do you think

1165
00:38:26.285 --> 00:38:27.285
high rate of infection. Do you think
we should have quarantine measures

1166
00:38:27.285 --> 00:38:29.202
we should have quarantine measures
had to stop people coming in? 7 0h,

1167
00:38:29.202 --> 00:38:30.827
had to
yeah. stop peopla '
comlng in? 7
. . 0h,

1168
00:38:30.827 --> 00:38:31.660
had to stop peopla coming in? ? Oh,
yeah. The time to

1169
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.327
had to stop people coming in? 7 Oh,
yeah. The time to do that is when we

1170
00:38:33.327 --> 00:38:34.744
yeah. The time to do that is when we
have a very low infection rate but

1171
00:38:34.744 --> 00:38:36.327
have a very low infection rate but
it isn’t very low yet it is coming

1172
00:38:36.327 --> 00:38:38.077
it isn’t very low yet it is coming
down very slowly. It is coming down

1173
00:38:38.077 --> 00:38:43.077
down very slowly. It is coming down
more slowly than the press

1174
00:38:43.077 --> 00:38:44.202
more slowly than the press
conference at Number Ten would like,

1175
00:38:44.202 --> 00:38:45.827
conference at Number Ten would like,
the experts there and so on. Until

1176
00:38:45.827 --> 00:38:50.702
the experts there and so on. Until
it is down a lot further, then our

1177
00:38:50.702 --> 00:38:51.035
it is down a lot further, than our
residents

1178
00:38:51.035 --> 00:38:52.077
it is down a lot further, then our
residents will be welcomed in Italy

1179
00:38:52.077 --> 00:38:53.452
residents will be welcomed in Italy
and Spain and Greece and all these

1180
00:38:53.452 --> 00:38:55.035
and Spain and Greece and all these
other countries. At the moment, I

1181
00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:56.369
other countries. At the moment, I
don’t think they will let us in

1182
00:38:56.369 --> 00:39:00.785
don’t think they will let us in
because they have a better situation

1183
00:39:00.785 --> 00:39:02.827
because they have a better situation
than us and they don’t want to

1184
00:39:02.827 --> 00:39:04.744
than us and they don’t want to
import infection. It’s a bit early

1185
00:39:04.744 --> 00:39:05.369
import infection. It’s a bit earty
to be talking

1186
00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:05.994
import infection. It’s a bit early
to be talking about quarantine for

1187
00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:08.327
to be talking about quarantine for
its right to make a plan when we get

1188
00:39:08.327 --> 00:39:10.660
its right to make a plan when we get
to that happy point where we have

1189
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.160
to that happy point where we have
the virus right down to low levels

1190
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.994
the virus right down to low levels
but at the moment I think one has to

1191
00:39:13.994 --> 00:39:16.244
but at the moment I think one has to
55V

1192
00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:17.410
but at the moment I think one has to
say that it’s a pity this wasn’t

1193
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.744
say that it’s a pity this wasn’t
done a long time ago, because my own

1194
00:39:20.744 --> 00:39:22.160
done a long time ago, because my own
view, and it’s only a guess because

1195
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.244
view, and it’s only a guess because
we don’t have the statistics

1196
00:39:23.244 --> 00:39:25.327
we don’t have the statistics
published, is that we have lots of

1197
00:39:25.327 --> 00:39:27.285
published, is that we have lots of
outbreaks in this country started

1198
00:39:27.285 --> 00:39:31.660
outbreaks in this country started
off by people coming back from high

1199
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.285
off by people coming back from high
incidence countries Italy

1200
00:39:32.285 --> 00:39:35.660
incidence countries Italy
particularly, and the virus going

1201
00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:35.827
particularty, and the virus going
under

1202
00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:40.369
particularly, and the virus going
under the radar and causing lots of

1203
00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:41.577
under the radar and causing lots of
infections, and changing in a subtle

1204
00:39:41.577 --> 00:39:43.035
infections, and changing in a subtia
way. We

1205
00:39:43.035 --> 00:39:44.035
infections, and changing in a subtle
way. We clearly don’t want that to

1206
00:39:44.035 --> 00:39:45.869
way. We dearty don’t want that to
happen in the

1207
00:39:45.869 --> 00:39:46.910
way. We clearly don’t want that to
happen in the future, so it’s a bit

1208
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:47.410
happen in the future, so it’s a bit
earty to be

1209
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.077
happen in the future, so it’s a bit
early to be talking about that now

1210
00:39:49.077 --> 00:39:50.702
early to be talking about that now
because we still have this very high

1211
00:39:50.702 --> 00:39:52.327
because we still have this very high
infection rate and we have to get it

1212
00:39:52.327 --> 00:39:55.410
infection rate and we have to get it
down before we can really get the

1213
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:55.619
down before we ran really get the
quarantine

1214
00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:56.410
down before we can really get the
quarantine thing rolling. Its right

1215
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.410
quarantine thing rolling. Its right
to make a plan for it but whether it

1216
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.535
to make a plan for it but whether it
should come in on Monday or not,

1217
00:40:00.535 --> 00:40:00.994
should come in on Monday or not,
well, I

1218
00:40:00.994 --> 00:40:01.119
should come in on Monday or not,
well, Idon’t

1219
00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:05.660
should come in on Monday or not,
well, I don’t know. Hi.

1220
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:05.827
should come in on Monday or not,
well, Idon’t know. Hi. If

1221
00:40:05.827 --> 00:40:05.994
should come in on Monday or not,
well, I don’t know. Hi. If the

1222
00:40:05.994 --> 00:40:08.202
well, Idon’t know. Hi. Ifthe
government

1223
00:40:08.202 --> 00:40:12.827
well, I don’t know. Hi. If the
government brings in regulations

1224
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:15.035
government brings in regulations
concerning quarantine, how

1225
00:40:15.035 --> 00:40:16.369
concerning quarantine, how
effectively are they going to be

1226
00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:17.744
effectively are they going to be
able to actually enforce the

1227
00:40:17.744 --> 00:40:22.327
able to actually enforce the
quarantine? There is talk of one in

1228
00:40:22.327 --> 00:40:24.910
quarantine? There is talk of one in
five people being randomly checked,

1229
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.535
five people being randomly checked,
but that is probably not good

1230
00:40:27.535 --> 00:40:29.744
but that is probably not good
enough. Does that mean they will be

1231
00:40:29.744 --> 00:40:31.952
enough. Does that mean they will be
checked once every five days, the

1232
00:40:31.952 --> 00:40:35.952
checked once every five days, the
same person? Are the people in

1233
00:40:35.952 --> 00:40:37.285
same person? Are the people in
quarantine going to be allowed to go

1234
00:40:37.285 --> 00:40:39.035
quarantine going to be allowed to go
and shop and receive medical

1235
00:40:39.035 --> 00:40:42.327
and shop and receive medical
suppﬁes?

1236
00:40:42.327 --> 00:40:47.077
and shop and receive medical
supplies? I think realistically it’s

1237
00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:48.369
supplies? I think realistically it’s
unenforceable stop I think the

1238
00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:49.577
unenforceable stop I think the
suggestion is not quite as

1239
00:40:49.577 --> 00:40:51.202
suggestion is not quite as
favourable as you are making it. I

1240
00:40:51.202 --> 00:40:52.577
favourable as you are making it. I
think it’s one in ten are expected

1241
00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:55.827
think it’s one in ten are expected
to be checked by border officials.

1242
00:40:55.827 --> 00:40:59.160
to be checked by border officials.
Let me ask you, Nadhim Zahawi.

1243
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.702
Let me ask you, Nadhim Zahawi.
People are required to supply an

1244
00:41:00.702 --> 00:41:03.327
People are required to supply an
address and a phone number. They can

1245
00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:06.785
address and a phone number. They ran
give you their

1246
00:41:06.785 --> 00:41:07.577
address and a phone number. They can
give you their mobile phone number,

1247
00:41:07.577 --> 00:41:09.410
give you their mobile phone number,
so I am wondering what the point of

1248
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.535
so I am wondering what the point of
that is. If you give your mobile

1249
00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:13.577
that is. If you give your mobile
phone, you can be anywhere if

1250
00:41:13.577 --> 00:41:14.827
phone, you can be anywhere if
someone rings and checks you are

1251
00:41:14.827 --> 00:41:16.619
someone rings and checks you are
supposedly where you say you are. If

1252
00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:16.827
suppos
you edly where yo
u 5.1
Y you a
re
. If

1253
00:41:16.827 --> 00:41:18.452
supposedly where you say you are. If
you go to Greece, you have to supply

1254
00:41:18.452 --> 00:41:19.869
you go to Greece, you have to supply
a landline number or you can’t get

1255
00:41:19.869 --> 00:41:24.077
a landline number or you can’t get
in. You have to fill in an online

1256
00:41:24.077 --> 00:41:25.827
in. You have to fill in an online
form with the address and phone

1257
00:41:25.827 --> 00:41:28.369
form with the address and phone
number, and of course there is a

1258
00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:29.785
number, and of course there is a
fine if they don’t comply with the

1259
00:41:29.785 --> 00:41:33.077
fine if they don’t comply with the
quarantine as well, but most people

1260
00:41:33.077 --> 00:41:34.119
quarantine as well, but most peopla
you will find,

1261
00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:35.160
quarantine as well, but most people
you will find, and before I became a

1262
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.410
you will find, and before I became a
politician I ran a research company,

1263
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.744
politician I ran a research company,
do the right thing. The reason we

1264
00:41:39.744 --> 00:41:41.119
do the right thing. The reason we
have done well is because the

1265
00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:44.327
have done well is because the
British people have done well and

1266
00:41:44.327 --> 00:41:45.285
British peopla have done well and
complied

1267
00:41:45.285 --> 00:41:46.244
British people have done well and
complied with the rules of social

1268
00:41:46.244 --> 00:41:46.410
complied with the mics of social
distancing,

1269
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.827
complied with the rules of social
distancing, washing their hands...

1270
00:41:49.827 --> 00:41:51.244
distancing, washing their hands...
So you think a mobile number is

1271
00:41:51.244 --> 00:41:54.452
So you think a mobile number is
adequate? Crop I think people will

1272
00:41:54.452 --> 00:41:54.660
adequate? Crop I think peopla will
do

1273
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.910
adequate? Crop I think people will
do the right thing. If they are

1274
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.160
do the right thing. If they are
coming to this country and filling

1275
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.244
coming to this country and filling
in a form and saying they will

1276
00:41:59.244 --> 00:42:00.327
in a form and saying they will
quarantine, they will do the right

1277
00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:03.785
quarantine, they will do the right
thing. We will keep this under

1278
00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:05.994
thing. We will keep this under
review and continued to take tough

1279
00:42:05.994 --> 00:42:07.077
review and continued to take tough
decisions, because these are

1280
00:42:07.077 --> 00:42:09.244
decisions, because these are
difficult, and we need people to

1281
00:42:09.244 --> 00:42:10.577
difficult, and we need people to
work together. We can’t do this on

1282
00:42:10.577 --> 00:42:13.577
work together. We can’t do this on
our own. But we know, the evidence

1283
00:42:13.577 --> 00:42:14.619
our own. But we know, the evidence
suggests that, when the incidence

1284
00:42:14.619 --> 00:42:18.452
suggests that, when the incidence
rate is low, we should try and make

1285
00:42:18.452 --> 00:42:21.202
rate is low, we should try and make
this work with our borders. Stick 3

1286
00:42:21.202 --> 00:42:21.660
this work with our borders. Stick a
question from

1287
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:26.619
this work with our borders. Stick 3
question from Mike Golding. We are

1288
00:42:26.619 --> 00:42:28.077
question from Mike Golding. We are
always told that we are following

1289
00:42:28.077 --> 00:42:29.994
always told that we are following
the science, but the government was

1290
00:42:29.994 --> 00:42:32.952
the science, but the government was
science advisers who we watch daily

1291
00:42:32.952 --> 00:42:37.035
science advisers who we watch daily
on the update look and sound

1292
00:42:37.035 --> 00:42:40.327
on the update look and sound
increasingly nervous about the early

1293
00:42:40.327 --> 00:42:43.952
increasingly nervous about the early
reduction in lockdown, before the UK

1294
00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:45.244
reduction in lockdown, before the UK
Test and Trace is fully operational

1295
00:42:45.244 --> 00:42:47.952
Test and Trace is fully operational
approval. Does the panel feel that

1296
00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:51.535
approval. Does the panel feel that
we are easing lockdown to quickly

1297
00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:52.910
we are easing lockdown to quickly
and so risking more deaths, 3 second

1298
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.702
and so risking more deaths, a second
wave of

1299
00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:56.827
and so risking more deaths, 3 second
wave of infection and, as a

1300
00:42:56.827 --> 00:42:57.327
wave of infection and, as a
consequence, further untold

1301
00:42:57.327 --> 00:43:02.327
consequence, further untold
increased damage to the UK economy

1302
00:43:02.327 --> 00:43:03.785
increased damage to the UK economy
Hugh, you don’t believe a second

1303
00:43:03.785 --> 00:43:06.202
Hugh, you don’t believe a second
wave is likely at all, do you? Could

1304
00:43:06.202 --> 00:43:10.285
wave is likely at all, do you? Could
you explain? I’m calling myself a

1305
00:43:10.285 --> 00:43:10.327
you explain? I’m falling myself a
second

1306
00:43:10.327 --> 00:43:11.535
you explain? I’m calling myself a
second wave sceptic because the idea

1307
00:43:11.535 --> 00:43:15.619
second wave sceptic because the idea
of that is faced with what happened

1308
00:43:15.619 --> 00:43:17.327
of that is faced with what happened
within Fraser in 1918, and I don’t

1309
00:43:17.327 --> 00:43:21.160
within Fraser in 1918, and I don’t
think that’s a good model for the

1310
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.327
think that’s a good model for the
stop in 1918, we were

1311
00:43:22.327 --> 00:43:22.577
think that’s a good model for the
stop in 1918, we werejust

1312
00:43:22.577 --> 00:43:22.744
think that’s a good model for the
stop in 1918, we were just coming

1313
00:43:22.744 --> 00:43:24.327
stop in 1918, we were just coming
out of the First World War and the

1314
00:43:24.327 --> 00:43:26.077
out of the First World War and the
virus was very different virus that

1315
00:43:26.077 --> 00:43:28.035
virus was very different virus that
forced the second wave was very

1316
00:43:28.035 --> 00:43:30.952
forced the second wave was very
different it attacks different

1317
00:43:30.952 --> 00:43:32.660
different it attacks different
people stop it killed more American

1318
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:32.744
peopla stop it killed more American
soldiers

1319
00:43:32.744 --> 00:43:34.035
people stop it killed more American
soldiers than the Germans did at end

1320
00:43:34.035 --> 00:43:36.202
soldiers than the Germans did at end
of the First World War, and we don’t

1321
00:43:36.202 --> 00:43:39.244
of the First World War, and we don’t
even know the first wave virus was

1322
00:43:39.244 --> 00:43:41.577
even know the first wave virus was
the same as the second and we don’t

1323
00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:43.577
the same as the second and we don’t
know if the third wave virus was the

1324
00:43:43.577 --> 00:43:45.994
know if the third wave virus was the
same as the second or first because

1325
00:43:45.994 --> 00:43:46.994
same as the second or first because
the virus wasn’t discovered until

1326
00:43:46.994 --> 00:43:52.077
the virus wasn’t discovered until
1933. What makes you think a second

1327
00:43:52.077 --> 00:43:52.327
1933. what makes you think a second
wave

1328
00:43:52.327 --> 00:43:53.702
1933. What makes you think a second
wave won’t happen with coronavirus,

1329
00:43:53.702 --> 00:43:54.494
wave won’t happen with coronavims,
given that we

1330
00:43:54.494 --> 00:43:55.702
wave won’t happen with coronavirus,
given that we are hearing from the

1331
00:43:55.702 --> 00:43:57.119
given that we are hearing from the
WHO and so many countries that there

1332
00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:59.327
WHO and so many countries that there
are fears it will happen? I think

1333
00:43:59.327 --> 00:44:02.910
are fears it will happen? I think
what would happen, if we got a lot

1334
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.994
what would happen, if we got a lot
done wrong, it would not be a second

1335
00:44:05.994 --> 00:44:07.577
done wrong, it would not be a second
wave. That is defined as the first

1336
00:44:07.577 --> 00:44:10.244
wave. That is defined as the first
wave goes away, then there is a gap

1337
00:44:10.244 --> 00:44:11.410
wave goes away, then there is a gap
when nothing happens and then the

1338
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:11.619
when nothing happens and then the
vims

1339
00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:12.994
when nothing happens and then the
virus takes off again. And that

1340
00:44:12.994 --> 00:44:18.119
virus takes off again. And that
hasn’t happened.

1341
00:44:20.785 --> 00:44:21.577
hasn’t happened. The big test is

1342
00:44:21.577 --> 00:44:21.952
hasn’t happened. The big testis
going to

1343
00:44:21.952 --> 00:44:25.244
hasn’t happened. The big test is
going to come in China, because

1344
00:44:25.244 --> 00:44:28.410
going to come in China, because
China has released its citizens from

1345
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.577
China has released its citizens from
lockdown and Sage, the advisory

1346
00:44:29.577 --> 00:44:32.369
lockdown and Sage, the advisory
committee, has been confident that

1347
00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.244
committee, has been confident that
China will have a second wave. Time

1348
00:44:34.244 --> 00:44:36.119
China will have a second wave. Time
will tell whether it does or not. No

1349
00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:38.535
will tell whether it does or not. No
sign yet. China is much more

1350
00:44:38.535 --> 00:44:41.369
sign yet. China is much more
worried, and all the cases in China

1351
00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:42.994
worried, and all the cases in China
are imported from other countries.

1352
00:44:42.994 --> 00:44:43.535
are imported from other countries.
So I think

1353
00:44:43.535 --> 00:44:46.327
are imported from other countries.
50 I think the second wave... I

1354
00:44:46.327 --> 00:44:47.785
So I think the second wave... I
can’t say it won’t happen but I

1355
00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:49.244
can’t say it won’t happen but I
think it’s unlikely to what will

1356
00:44:49.244 --> 00:44:50.952
think it’s unlikely to what will
happen is what happened in

1357
00:44:50.952 --> 00:44:52.035
happen is what happened in
Singapore, where they have very good

1358
00:44:52.035 --> 00:44:55.535
Singapore, where they have very good
controls. When the virus got into

1359
00:44:55.535 --> 00:44:55.952
controls. when the virus got into
these migrant

1360
00:44:55.952 --> 00:44:56.744
controls. When the virus got into
these migrant worker dormitories and

1361
00:44:56.744 --> 00:44:58.785
these migrant worker dormitories and
took off, a bit like it took off and

1362
00:44:58.785 --> 00:45:01.827
took off, a bit like it took off and
is still busy in our care homes,

1363
00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:02.035
is still busy in our rare homes,
because

1364
00:45:02.035 --> 00:45:03.702
is still busy in our care homes,
because these are very difficult

1365
00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:05.785
because these are very difficult
places to have infection control.

1366
00:45:05.785 --> 00:45:06.494
places to have infection control.
The vims

1367
00:45:06.494 --> 00:45:08.369
places to have infection control.
The virus will hang around and it

1368
00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:09.785
The virus will hang around and it
won’t be a second wave, it will

1369
00:45:09.785 --> 00:45:10.035
The virus will hang around and it
won’t be a second wave, it willjust

1370
00:45:10.035 --> 00:45:11.577
won’t be a second wave, it will just
be the

1371
00:45:11.577 --> 00:45:12.244
won’t be a second wave, it willjust
be the continuation of outbreaks

1372
00:45:12.244 --> 00:45:15.869
be the continuation of outbreaks
hither and thither. Those are the

1373
00:45:15.869 --> 00:45:19.535
hither and thither. Those are the
sort of noises coming from people

1374
00:45:19.535 --> 00:45:19.744
sort of noises coming from peopla
like

1375
00:45:19.744 --> 00:45:21.327
sort of noises coming from people
like Matt Hancock at the moment this

1376
00:45:21.327 --> 00:45:23.577
like Matt Hancock at the moment this
is what we have to worry about this

1377
00:45:23.577 --> 00:45:25.785
is what we have to worry about this
is what we have to stop without

1378
00:45:25.785 --> 00:45:30.619
is what we have to stop without
contact tracing. That will enable us

1379
00:45:30.619 --> 00:45:30.994
contact tracing. That will enablc us
to identify

1380
00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:35.202
contact tracing. That will enable us
to identify these outbreaks. This

1381
00:45:35.202 --> 00:45:35.952
to identify these outbreaks. This
virus specialises in causing

1382
00:45:35.952 --> 00:45:38.202
virus specialises in causing
outbreaks and about half the cases

1383
00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:38.535
outbreaks and about half the rases
are in

1384
00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:44.160
outbreaks and about half the cases
are in outbreaks, not single cases.

1385
00:45:45.994 --> 00:45:46.327
are in outbreaks, not singla cases.
We

1386
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:47.494
are in outbreaks, not single cases.
We need the system up and running

1387
00:45:47.494 --> 00:45:47.660
We need the system up and mnning
before

1388
00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.827
We need the system up and running
before we do any massive release of

1389
00:45:51.827 --> 00:45:52.994
before we do any massive release of
lockdown. I think what’s happened so

1390
00:45:52.994 --> 00:45:54.827
lockdown. I think what’s happened so
far is essentially pretty trivial

1391
00:45:54.827 --> 00:45:57.619
far is essentially pretty trivial
chipping away at the lockdown and

1392
00:45:57.619 --> 00:45:58.827
chipping away at the lockdown and
we’ll see whether that has any

1393
00:45:58.827 --> 00:46:03.577
we’ll see whether that has any
effect on the R number and perhaps

1394
00:46:03.577 --> 00:46:03.910
effect on the R number and perhaps
we ran

1395
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:04.910
effect on the R number and perhaps
we can talk about that later as

1396
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.744
we ran talk about that later as
well, how

1397
00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:08.702
we can talk about that later as
well, how much, how busy the virus

1398
00:46:08.702 --> 00:46:13.660
well, how much, how busy the virus
is.

1399
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:19.744
Mike, you wanted to come back in? I
think it is arbitrary, whatever you

1400
00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:20.285
think it is arbitrary, whatever you
rail it,

1401
00:46:20.285 --> 00:46:21.535
think it is arbitrary, whatever you
call it, whether you call it a

1402
00:46:21.535 --> 00:46:22.119
all it, whether you all it a
second

1403
00:46:22.119 --> 00:46:23.535
call it, whether you call it a
second wave or an increase in

1404
00:46:23.535 --> 00:46:26.785
second wave or an increase in
infection. The point is, the R

1405
00:46:26.785 --> 00:46:29.535
infection. The point is, the R
number, we know, is very close to

1406
00:46:29.535 --> 00:46:33.285
number, we know, is very close to
one. It seems to me that the

1407
00:46:33.285 --> 00:46:39.160
one. It seems to me that the
government’s messaging, some

1408
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.244
government’s messaging, some
conscious, some unconscious, has led

1409
00:46:44.244 --> 00:46:45.035
conscious, some unconscious, has lad
towards quite

1410
00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:45.619
conscious, some unconscious, has led
towards quite significant increase

1411
00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:47.827
towards quite significant increase
in traffic and people on beaches and

1412
00:46:47.827 --> 00:46:48.244
in traffic and peopla on beaches and
peopla at

1413
00:46:48.244 --> 00:46:52.577
in traffic and people on beaches and
people at beauty spots. And for

1414
00:46:52.577 --> 00:46:56.035
people at beauty spots. And for
instance even protesting. You can

1415
00:46:56.035 --> 00:46:56.744
instance even protesting. You ran
see that

1416
00:46:56.744 --> 00:46:57.494
instance even protesting. You can
see that there are causes for

1417
00:46:57.494 --> 00:47:03.535
see that there are causes for
concern. Does that make you anxious?

1418
00:47:03.535 --> 00:47:08.202
concern. Does that make you anxious?
Not for me personally, but it makes

1419
00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:12.119
Not for me personally, but it makes
me anxious for people around me, for

1420
00:47:12.119 --> 00:47:13.035
me anxious for peopla around me, for
peopla who we

1421
00:47:13.035 --> 00:47:14.035
me anxious for people around me, for
people who we know in our area who

1422
00:47:14.035 --> 00:47:14.410
peopla who we know in our area who
are in

1423
00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.327
people who we know in our area who
are in the at risk group. I would

1424
00:47:18.327 --> 00:47:20.160
are in the at risk group. I would
say it would be going a bit far to

1425
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:20.410
say it would be going a bit far to
55V

1426
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.244
say it would be going a bit far to
say it makes me anxious, but it

1427
00:47:23.244 --> 00:47:27.327
say it makes me anxious, but it
certainly concerns me, I don’t want

1428
00:47:27.327 --> 00:47:29.035
certainly concerns me, I don’t want
to end up going back into a

1429
00:47:29.035 --> 00:47:32.369
to end up going back into a
lockdown. Let me ask the panel here.

1430
00:47:32.369 --> 00:47:36.202
lockdown. Let me ask the panel here.
The thrust of the question is, is

1431
00:47:36.202 --> 00:47:38.660
The thrust of the question is, is
the lockdown being eased too early?

1432
00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:39.327
the lockdown being eased too earty?
At some point

1433
00:47:39.327 --> 00:47:40.577
the lockdown being eased too early?
At some point the lockdown has to be

1434
00:47:40.577 --> 00:47:41.994
At some point the lockdown has to be
eased as we go into the recovery

1435
00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:45.494
eased as we go into the recovery
phase because we know that the

1436
00:47:45.494 --> 00:47:46.619
phase because we know that the
lockdown is taking its toll and

1437
00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:49.702
lockdown is taking its toll and
lives will be lost in terms of

1438
00:47:49.702 --> 00:47:51.785
lives will be lost in terms of
economics anyway. At some point it

1439
00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:52.327
economic anyway. At some point it
needs to

1440
00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:53.910
economics anyway. At some point it
needs to be eased. But my view is

1441
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:56.410
needs to be eased. But my view is
that actually we need to do it

1442
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.410
that actually we need to do it
sensibly. We have got to come out of

1443
00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:00.244
sensibly. We have got to come out of
it sensibly, we have got to

1444
00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.827
it sensibly, we have got to
understand the rules and people need

1445
00:48:01.827 --> 00:48:02.244
understand the mles and people need
to follow

1446
00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:04.577
understand the rules and people need
to follow them. I would go back to

1447
00:48:04.577 --> 00:48:07.910
to follow them. I would go back to
saying, it depends on a really high

1448
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.160
saying, it depends on a really high
compliance to the rules that are put

1449
00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:10.619
compliance to the mles that are put
out there.

1450
00:48:10.619 --> 00:48:12.202
compliance to the rules that are put
out there. Even if we continue with

1451
00:48:12.202 --> 00:48:14.619
out there. Even if we continue with
the lockdown, people are becoming

1452
00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:14.785
the lockdown, peopla are becoming
resﬂass

1453
00:48:14.785 --> 00:48:16.827
the lockdown, people are becoming
restless anyway, so we will have to

1454
00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:17.410
resﬂass anyway, so we will have to
do something

1455
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.244
restless anyway, so we will have to
do something to mitigate that

1456
00:48:18.244 --> 00:48:19.327
do something to mitigate that
restlessness and make sure we come

1457
00:48:19.327 --> 00:48:19.785
resﬂassness and make sure we come
out of

1458
00:48:19.785 --> 00:48:23.077
restlessness and make sure we come
out of lockdown safely. Do you think

1459
00:48:23.077 --> 00:48:25.952
out of lockdown safely. Do you think
now is the right time? I guess if we

1460
00:48:25.952 --> 00:48:26.160
now is the right time? I guess if we
ran

1461
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.577
now is the right time? I guess if we
can maintain some of the things, the

1462
00:48:28.577 --> 00:48:29.410
ran maintain some of the things, the
handmshing

1463
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.744
can maintain some of the things, the
handwashing kills the virus, we know

1464
00:48:30.744 --> 00:48:31.285
handmshing kills the virus, we know
it is still

1465
00:48:31.285 --> 00:48:32.619
handwashing kills the virus, we know
it is still amongst us and there are

1466
00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:34.577
it is still amongst us and there are
steps we will have to take, we don’t

1467
00:48:34.577 --> 00:48:36.244
steps we will have to take, we don’t
know how long it is going to hang

1468
00:48:36.244 --> 00:48:38.660
know how long it is going to hang
around, so we will have to live our

1469
00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.994
around, so we will have to live our
lives very differently in terms of

1470
00:48:40.994 --> 00:48:43.327
lives very differently in terms of
going forward. It will mean we will

1471
00:48:43.327 --> 00:48:45.452
going forward. It will mean we will
have to socially distance for a

1472
00:48:45.452 --> 00:48:47.244
have to socially distance for a
while longer. We will have to be

1473
00:48:47.244 --> 00:48:47.410
whila longer. We will have to be
more

1474
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.577
while longer. We will have to be
more protective in the gear that we

1475
00:48:49.577 --> 00:48:51.660
more protective in the gear that we
wear. Whether we do it now, next

1476
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:52.785
wear. whether we do it now, next
week or

1477
00:48:52.785 --> 00:48:54.577
wear. Whether we do it now, next
week or two months’ time, we have to

1478
00:48:54.577 --> 00:48:56.994
week or two months’ time, we have to
gradually come out, as long as we

1479
00:48:56.994 --> 00:48:59.577
gradually come out, as long as we
have a sensible rationale for the

1480
00:48:59.577 --> 00:49:03.535
have a sensible rationale for the
steps are taking. Annamarie. I was

1481
00:49:03.535 --> 00:49:04.160
steps are taking. Annamaria. I was
thinking along

1482
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.202
steps are taking. Annemarie. I was
thinking along the same lines as

1483
00:49:05.202 --> 00:49:07.244
thinking along the same lines as
Donna. A lot of the measures the

1484
00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:09.994
Donna. A lot of the measures the
government are bringing in at the

1485
00:49:09.994 --> 00:49:13.619
government are bringing in at the
moment, quarantine, wearing

1486
00:49:13.619 --> 00:49:15.244
moment, quarantine, wearing
facemasks, social distancing, etc,

1487
00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:17.577
facemasks, social distancing, etc,
all rely on people’s goodwill and

1488
00:49:17.577 --> 00:49:20.619
all rely on people’s goodwill and
the general public agreeing to these

1489
00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:21.577
the general public agreeing to these
measures. I was

1490
00:49:21.577 --> 00:49:21.952
the general public agreeing to these
measures. I wasjust

1491
00:49:21.952 --> 00:49:22.327
the general public agreeing to these
measures. I was just wondering what

1492
00:49:22.327 --> 00:49:27.327
measures. I was just wondering what
the panel’s thoughts were on how can

1493
00:49:27.327 --> 00:49:27.702
the panel’s thoughts were on how ran
the government

1494
00:49:27.702 --> 00:49:29.660
the panel’s thoughts were on how can
the government actually try and

1495
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.577
the government actually try and
improve public goodwill with regards

1496
00:49:32.577 --> 00:49:35.952
improve public goodwill with regards
to the introduction of track and

1497
00:49:35.952 --> 00:49:39.744
to the introduction of track and
trace apps? It is very clear that

1498
00:49:39.744 --> 00:49:41.327
trace apps? It is very clear that
the public are getting a bit fed up

1499
00:49:41.327 --> 00:49:44.244
the public are getting a bit fed up
at the moment and going out on

1500
00:49:44.244 --> 00:49:45.452
at the moment and going out on
beaches and clearly breaking a lot

1501
00:49:45.452 --> 00:49:45.785
beaches and dearty breaking a lot
of the

1502
00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:51.160
beaches and clearly breaking a lot
of the rules. Ben? I wanted to touch

1503
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.119
of the mles. Ben? I wanted to touch
on something

1504
00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:53.744
of the rules. Ben? I wanted to touch
on something that Donna briefly

1505
00:49:53.744 --> 00:49:57.410
on something that Donna briefly
mentioned. While Mike is right to

1506
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.494
mentioned. while Mike is right to
55V

1507
00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:57.994
mentioned. while Mike is right to
say it is

1508
00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.952
mentioned. While Mike is right to
say it is important we listen to the

1509
00:49:59.952 --> 00:50:01.577
say it is important we listen to the
health experts, I think it is

1510
00:50:01.577 --> 00:50:02.827
health experts, I think it is
equally important that we listen to

1511
00:50:02.827 --> 00:50:05.702
equally important that we listen to
the economists. I think we are going

1512
00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:08.160
the economists. I think we are going
to approach a point soon where the

1513
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.452
to approach a point soon where the
lives lost due to the economy being

1514
00:50:10.452 --> 00:50:11.119
lives lost due to the economy being
shut down

1515
00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:12.744
lives lost due to the economy being
shutdown exceed the lives lost

1516
00:50:12.744 --> 00:50:15.410
shutdown exceed the lives lost
because of the virus. I have heard

1517
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.494
because of the vims. I have heard
stories

1518
00:50:15.494 --> 00:50:17.702
because of the virus. I have heard
stories about chemotherapy care

1519
00:50:17.702 --> 00:50:17.952
stories about chemotherapy rare
being

1520
00:50:17.952 --> 00:50:18.785
stories about chemotherapy care
being delayed, suicide and mental

1521
00:50:18.785 --> 00:50:24.244
being delayed, suicide and mental
health wards are going up, and in

1522
00:50:24.244 --> 00:50:25.535
health wards are going up, and in
schools, the deprived children who

1523
00:50:25.535 --> 00:50:28.535
schools, the deprived children who
are falling behind because of school

1524
00:50:28.535 --> 00:50:30.160
are falling behind because of school
closures, universities closed and

1525
00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.202
closures, universities closed and
teaching isn’t being delivered. This

1526
00:50:32.202 --> 00:50:33.785
teaching isn’t being delivered. This
will have effects for years to come

1527
00:50:33.785 --> 00:50:35.619
will have effects for years to come
and I think it is really time to

1528
00:50:35.619 --> 00:50:39.327
and I think it is really time to
start getting out of this lockdown

1529
00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:42.160
start getting out of this lockdown
now. David, coming back to my’s

1530
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:42.369
now. David, coming back to mrs
original

1531
00:50:42.369 --> 00:50:43.577
now. David, coming back to my’s
original question, is the lockdown

1532
00:50:43.577 --> 00:50:46.910
original question, is the lockdown
being eased too early? In part it is

1533
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.827
being eased too earty? In part it is
because

1534
00:50:47.827 --> 00:50:50.410
being eased too early? In part it is
because track and trace is not up

1535
00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:50.952
because track and trace is not up
and mnning. I

1536
00:50:50.952 --> 00:50:51.202
because track and trace is not up
and running. Iwould

1537
00:50:51.202 --> 00:50:51.327
because track and trace is not up
and running. I would support

1538
00:50:51.327 --> 00:50:51.785
and mnning. Iwould support
relaxing the

1539
00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:52.744
and running. I would support
relaxing the lockdown but it has to

1540
00:50:52.744 --> 00:50:56.160
relaxing the lockdown but it has to
be based on the science and clearly

1541
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:56.577
be based on the science and dearty
we are

1542
00:50:56.577 --> 00:50:57.994
be based on the science and clearly
we are worried about the R number.

1543
00:50:57.994 --> 00:50:59.827
we are worried about the R number.
You have got to sort out testing and

1544
00:50:59.827 --> 00:51:02.160
You have got to sort out testing and
you have got to make sure that

1545
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.577
you have got to make sure that
peopla ran

1546
00:51:02.577 --> 00:51:04.577
you have got to make sure that
people can get access to a test in

1547
00:51:04.577 --> 00:51:05.035
peopla ran get access to a test in
24 hours

1548
00:51:05.035 --> 00:51:06.702
people can get access to a test in
2A hours and get the results and 2A

1549
00:51:06.702 --> 00:51:07.327
24 hours and get the results and 24
hours. You

1550
00:51:07.327 --> 00:51:08.785
2A hours and get the results and 2A
hours. You have got to give local

1551
00:51:08.785 --> 00:51:10.410
hours. You have got to give local
authorities the power to act quickly

1552
00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:12.535
authorities the power to act quickly
if there is a break—out in their

1553
00:51:12.535 --> 00:51:13.077
if there is a break-out in their
area. You

1554
00:51:13.077 --> 00:51:16.244
if there is a break—out in their
area. You have got to get to 50,000

1555
00:51:16.244 --> 00:51:18.160
area. You have got to get to 50,000
human tracers and have an app that

1556
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.244
human tracers and have an app that
works that people have trust and

1557
00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:21.785
works that people have trust and
confidence in. Some of the challenge

1558
00:51:21.785 --> 00:51:23.410
confidence in. Some of the challenge
is that confidence has been lost and

1559
00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.869
is that confidence has been lost and
the government has to move quickly

1560
00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:28.202
the government has to move quickly
to regain that confidence and also

1561
00:51:28.202 --> 00:51:29.827
to regain that confidence and also
keep the messaging straightforward

1562
00:51:29.827 --> 00:51:30.869
keep the messaging straightforward
so people actually understand what

1563
00:51:30.869 --> 00:51:31.202
so peopla actually understand what
the

1564
00:51:31.202 --> 00:51:33.244
so people actually understand what
the rules are and what they have to

1565
00:51:33.244 --> 00:51:33.744
the mles are and what they have to
do. That

1566
00:51:33.744 --> 00:51:35.244
the rules are and what they have to
do. That was some of the concern

1567
00:51:35.244 --> 00:51:36.869
do. That was some of the concern
about Boris’s announcement a few

1568
00:51:36.869 --> 00:51:38.244
about Boris’s announcement a few
weeks ago because it

1569
00:51:38.244 --> 00:51:39.160
about Boris’s announcement a few
weeks ago because it was not clear

1570
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.244
weeks ago because it was not clear
and people did not understand it.

1571
00:51:42.244 --> 00:51:42.619
and peopla did not understand it.
Ollie, you

1572
00:51:42.619 --> 00:51:46.160
and people did not understand it.
Ollie, you have got your hand up.

1573
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:46.494
Ollie, you have got your hand up.
Yes, I

1574
00:51:46.494 --> 00:51:46.660
Ollie, you have got your hand up.
Yes, Ithink

1575
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:53.160
Ollie, you have got your hand up.
Yes, I think the horse has bolted. I

1576
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.327
Yes, I think the horse has bolted. I
was on the protest in Southampton

1577
00:51:54.327 --> 00:51:59.035
was on the protest in Southampton
yesterday. There were a certain

1578
00:51:59.035 --> 00:52:00.494
yesterday. There were a certain
amount of people, a fair amount of

1579
00:52:00.494 --> 00:52:01.535
amount of peopla, a fair amount of
peopla wearing

1580
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:02.785
amount of people, a fair amount of
people wearing masks, but an awful

1581
00:52:02.785 --> 00:52:03.952
peopla wearing masks, but an awful
lot that

1582
00:52:03.952 --> 00:52:09.577
people wearing masks, but an awful
lot that were not. And a lot of them

1583
00:52:09.577 --> 00:52:13.244
lot that were not. And a lot of them
were people like me. I think that

1584
00:52:13.244 --> 00:52:16.577
were people like me. I think that
one of the issues obviously coming

1585
00:52:16.577 --> 00:52:19.535
one of the issues obviously coming
back to the recent report that it is

1586
00:52:19.535 --> 00:52:22.577
back to the recent report that it is
not even like there has been a cat

1587
00:52:22.577 --> 00:52:23.119
not even like there has been a rat
amongst the

1588
00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:25.577
not even like there has been a cat
amongst the pigeons. Your government

1589
00:52:25.577 --> 00:52:31.160
amongst the pigeons. Your government
have not been clear

1590
00:52:31.202 --> 00:52:38.952
have not been clear enough on why we
are affected more by COVID—19. Has

1591
00:52:38.952 --> 00:52:39.160
are affected more by COVID-19. Has
your

1592
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.119
are affected more by COVID—19. Has
your government gone to Africa, for

1593
00:52:40.119 --> 00:52:44.952
your government gone to Africa, for
example, which has a better record

1594
00:52:44.952 --> 00:52:49.619
example, which has a better record
than we have in the UK? Has your

1595
00:52:49.619 --> 00:52:54.202
than we have in the UK? Has your
government gone to the countries

1596
00:52:54.202 --> 00:53:00.035
government gone to the countries
with the origins where people are

1597
00:53:00.035 --> 00:53:00.160
with the origins where peopla are
more

1598
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.535
with the origins where people are
more vulnerable? The horse has

1599
00:53:01.535 --> 00:53:03.327
more vulnerable? The horse has
bolted and as a parent I would say

1600
00:53:03.327 --> 00:53:04.619
bolted and as a parent I would say
the energy of the government now

1601
00:53:04.619 --> 00:53:10.035
the energy of the government now
needs to go into mitigation because

1602
00:53:10.035 --> 00:53:13.410
needs to go into mitigation because
even with the track and testing I

1603
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:15.285
even with the track and testing I
think a significant amount of people

1604
00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:15.660
think a significant amount of peopla
will not

1605
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.035
think a significant amount of people
will not be interested and will not

1606
00:53:17.035 --> 00:53:19.369
will not be interested and will not
be listening. This is a fact and

1607
00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:22.994
be listening. This is a fact and
there needs to be energy put into

1608
00:53:22.994 --> 00:53:23.327
there needs to be energy put into
how ran

1609
00:53:23.327 --> 00:53:24.369
there needs to be energy put into
how can we mitigate against the fact

1610
00:53:24.369 --> 00:53:24.827
how ran we mitigate against the fact
that people

1611
00:53:24.827 --> 00:53:27.577
how can we mitigate against the fact
that people are now not listening?

1612
00:53:27.577 --> 00:53:31.619
that peopla are now not listening?
Flora.

1613
00:53:31.619 --> 00:53:33.827
that people are now not listening?
Flora. Touching on Ben’s point about

1614
00:53:33.827 --> 00:53:35.410
Flora. Touching on Ben’s point about
the economy, I think maybe the

1615
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:36.660
the economy, I think maybe the
conversation around that needs to be

1616
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.619
conversation around that needs to be
focused more on the inequalities

1617
00:53:40.619 --> 00:53:42.827
focused more on the inequalities
that arise. There are studies that

1618
00:53:42.827 --> 00:53:46.785
that arise. There are studies that
suggest mortality rate improves in

1619
00:53:46.785 --> 00:53:48.952
suggest mortality rate improves in
situations of economic crises, but

1620
00:53:48.952 --> 00:53:50.785
situations of economic crises, but
you really need to be focusing on

1621
00:53:50.785 --> 00:53:53.202
you really need to be focusing on
how we need to try and reduce the

1622
00:53:53.202 --> 00:53:56.785
how we need to try and reduce the
inequalities that will be arising

1623
00:53:56.785 --> 00:53:58.619
inequalities that will be arising
there. Secondly, we have seen the

1624
00:53:58.619 --> 00:53:59.327
there. Secondly, we have seen the
trust in government absolutely

1625
00:53:59.327 --> 00:54:03.619
trust in government absolutely
plummet ever since the Prime

1626
00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:04.660
plummet ever since the Prime
Minister’s special adviser broke his

1627
00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.327
Minister’s special adviser broke his
own lockdown rules, and yet the

1628
00:54:08.327 --> 00:54:08.702
own lockdown mles, and yet the
trust in

1629
00:54:08.702 --> 00:54:10.577
own lockdown rules, and yet the
trust in scientists like Chris

1630
00:54:10.577 --> 00:54:12.160
trust in scientists like Chris
whitty is

1631
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.619
trust in scientists like Chris
Whitty is incredibly high and I was

1632
00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:14.035
whitty is incredibly high and I was
wondering

1633
00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:15.285
Whitty is incredibly high and I was
wondering whether we should discuss

1634
00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:16.744
wondering whether we should discuss
whether the scientists should have

1635
00:54:16.744 --> 00:54:18.160
whether the scientists should have
more influence in the policies that

1636
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.202
more inﬂuence in the policies that
are being

1637
00:54:19.202 --> 00:54:20.202
more influence in the policies that
are being made rather than acting as

1638
00:54:20.202 --> 00:54:26.410
are being made rather than acting as
an advisory group. Lorraine? One of

1639
00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.577
an advisory group. Lorraine? One of
the things they produced on the

1640
00:54:29.577 --> 00:54:34.119
the things they produced on the
lockdown was allowing people to

1641
00:54:34.119 --> 00:54:34.577
lockdown was allowing peopla to
travel long

1642
00:54:34.577 --> 00:54:35.160
lockdown was allowing people to
travel long distances, any distance,

1643
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.952
travel long distances, any distance,
to exercise. Of course all the

1644
00:54:38.952 --> 00:54:40.202
to exercise. Of course all the
south—west where we had really low

1645
00:54:40.202 --> 00:54:41.702
south-west where we had really low
infection

1646
00:54:41.702 --> 00:54:44.785
south—west where we had really low
infection rates has been invaded

1647
00:54:44.785 --> 00:54:46.327
infection rates has been invaded
from hordes of people coming to the

1648
00:54:46.327 --> 00:54:48.660
from hordes of people coming to the
beaches and the beauty spots, who

1649
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.994
beaches and the beauty spots, who
come from areas of the UK that have

1650
00:54:52.994 --> 00:54:56.577
come from areas of the UK that have
very high rates, and yet the

1651
00:54:56.577 --> 00:55:00.827
very high rates, and yet the
government have not addressed that.

1652
00:55:00.827 --> 00:55:03.285
government have not addressed that.
Nadhim Cumming coming to my’s

1653
00:55:03.285 --> 00:55:03.660
Nadhim Cumming coming to mrs
question, is

1654
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.869
Nadhim Cumming coming to my’s
question, is the lockdown being

1655
00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:06.619
question, is the lockdown being
eased too quickly before track and

1656
00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:08.452
eased too quickly before track and
trace is fully operational and

1657
00:55:08.452 --> 00:55:12.535
trace is fully operational and
proven? Are we risking more deaths?

1658
00:55:12.535 --> 00:55:14.577
proven? Are we risking more deaths?
First of all, we have been

1659
00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:15.494
First of all, we have been
deliberately slow, baby steps.

1660
00:55:15.494 --> 00:55:18.119
deliberately slow, baby steps.
Initially there was a huge pressure

1661
00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:20.452
Initially there was a huge pressure
on the Prime Minister to open all

1662
00:55:20.452 --> 00:55:21.952
on the Prime Minister to open all
nonessential retail by the lst of

1663
00:55:21.952 --> 00:55:22.869
nonessential retail by the 1st of
june and the

1664
00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:23.119
nonessential retail by the ist of
June and the Prime

1665
00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:25.202
nonessential retail by the 1st of
June and the Prime Minister said,

1666
00:55:25.202 --> 00:55:25.994
june and the Prime Minister said,
no, we will

1667
00:55:25.994 --> 00:55:26.910
June and the Prime Minister said,
no, we will look at car showrooms

1668
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.994
no, we will look at far showrooms
and

1669
00:55:26.994 --> 00:55:29.744
no, we will look at car showrooms
and outdoor markets and if we

1670
00:55:29.744 --> 00:55:32.410
and outdoor markets and if we
continue to bear down on the R

1671
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:34.285
continue to bear down on the R
number, by the 15th of

1672
00:55:34.285 --> 00:55:35.369
continue to bear down on the R
number, by the 15th ofJune we will

1673
00:55:35.369 --> 00:55:35.744
number, by the 15th of june we will
open up

1674
00:55:35.744 --> 00:55:37.410
number, by the 15th ofJune we will
open up nonessential retail. I am

1675
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:38.452
open up nonessential retail. I am
the business and industry minister

1676
00:55:38.452 --> 00:55:40.035
the business and industry minister
and I have been working on all the

1677
00:55:40.035 --> 00:55:43.619
and I have been working on all the
different guidelines for different

1678
00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:45.910
different guidelines for different
environments of work, outdoor,

1679
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:47.619
environments of work, outdoor,
indoor, construction and retail. We

1680
00:55:47.619 --> 00:55:48.994
indoor, constmction and retail. We
have got task

1681
00:55:48.994 --> 00:55:49.869
indoor, construction and retail. We
have got task forces led by

1682
00:55:49.869 --> 00:55:52.119
have got task forces led by
ministers, looking at pubs and

1683
00:55:52.119 --> 00:55:54.619
ministers, looking at pubs and
restaurants, places of worship,

1684
00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:57.244
restaurants, places of worship,
theatres, salons, for example, all

1685
00:55:57.244 --> 00:55:59.619
theatres, salons, for example, all
the difficult areas of work. We are

1686
00:55:59.619 --> 00:56:02.077
the difficult areas of work. We are
doing all of that work at the same

1687
00:56:02.077 --> 00:56:05.619
doing all of that work at the same
time. Track and trace, the pilot

1688
00:56:05.619 --> 00:56:07.910
time. Track and trace, the pilot
that we ran in the Isle of Wight,

1689
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:09.619
that we ran in the Isle of Wight,
one of the important findings of

1690
00:56:09.619 --> 00:56:11.160
one of the important findings of
that is that people said the first

1691
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:11.369
that is that peopla said the first
contact

1692
00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:13.119
that is that people said the first
contact they want is with a human

1693
00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:16.244
contact they want is with a human
being, which is why we have

1694
00:56:16.244 --> 00:56:18.369
being, which is why we have
recruited 25,000 people who can deal

1695
00:56:18.369 --> 00:56:19.077
recruited 25,000 peopla who ran deal
with

1696
00:56:19.077 --> 00:56:20.327
recruited 25,000 people who can deal
with about 10,000 cases... When are

1697
00:56:20.327 --> 00:56:21.744
with about 10,000 cases... when are
we going to get

1698
00:56:21.744 --> 00:56:22.535
with about 10,000 cases... When are
we going to get figures because it

1699
00:56:22.535 --> 00:56:24.535
we going to get figures because it
has been a week now since track and

1700
00:56:24.535 --> 00:56:26.744
has been a week now since track and
trace was launched? We have had some

1701
00:56:26.744 --> 00:56:27.660
trace was hunched? We have had some
figures that were

1702
00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.327
trace was launched? We have had some
figures that were leaked to Channel

1703
00:56:29.327 --> 00:56:30.744
figures that were leaked to Channel
4 News, which suggested very few

1704
00:56:30.744 --> 00:56:32.702
4 News, which suggested very few
people have been contacted. When are

1705
00:56:32.702 --> 00:56:34.952
people have been contacted. when are
we going to get

1706
00:56:34.952 --> 00:56:37.327
people have been contacted. When are
we going to get figures? A very good

1707
00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.702
we going to get figures? A very good
question and we are working ﬂat out

1708
00:56:38.702 --> 00:56:40.327
question and we are working ﬂat out
to make sure we get

1709
00:56:40.327 --> 00:56:40.660
question and we are working flat out
to make sure we get the figures

1710
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.077
to make sure we get the figures
right. The other question that links

1711
00:56:43.077 --> 00:56:44.910
right. The other question that links
to your question is the figures have

1712
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:48.494
to your question is the figures have
to be robust and accurate, which is

1713
00:56:48.494 --> 00:56:49.494
to be robust and accurate, which is
what the statisticians have asked

1714
00:56:49.494 --> 00:56:54.035
what the statisticians have asked
us. You want to make sure that the

1715
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:54.244
us. You want to make sure that the
statistis

1716
00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:54.827
us. You want to make sure that the
statistics authority does not

1717
00:56:54.827 --> 00:56:58.327
statistics authority does not
criticise you? We want to make sure

1718
00:56:58.327 --> 00:56:59.952
criticise you? We want to make sure
the figures we are releasing are

1719
00:56:59.952 --> 00:57:02.619
the figures we are releasing are
accurate and to get them right

1720
00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.202
accurate and to get them right
because people are being tracked and

1721
00:57:04.202 --> 00:57:06.160
because people are being tracked and
traced and tested in different

1722
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.077
traced and tested in different
modes, whether through going to a

1723
00:57:08.077 --> 00:57:12.160
modes, whether through going to a
physical point... When will we get

1724
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.327
physical point... when will we get
them?

1725
00:57:14.327 --> 00:57:15.494
physical point... When will we get
them? When we think they are robust

1726
00:57:15.494 --> 00:57:16.202
them? when we think they are robust
we will

1727
00:57:16.202 --> 00:57:17.119
them? When we think they are robust
we will start issuing the figures

1728
00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:19.035
we will start issuing the figures
and make sure that the app is then

1729
00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:20.327
and make sure that the app is than
fully rolled out

1730
00:57:20.327 --> 00:57:22.785
and make sure that the app is then
fully rolled out nationally. We are

1731
00:57:22.785 --> 00:57:24.285
fully rolled out nationally. We are
also asking local authorities to

1732
00:57:24.285 --> 00:57:24.785
also asking [oral authorities to
have a

1733
00:57:24.785 --> 00:57:26.619
also asking local authorities to
have a local plan ready. For the

1734
00:57:26.619 --> 00:57:27.285
have a [oral plan ready. For the
first time,

1735
00:57:27.285 --> 00:57:29.619
have a local plan ready. For the
first time, and this is really

1736
00:57:29.619 --> 00:57:32.160
first time, and this is really
important, Mike, in terms of your

1737
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.410
important, Mike, in terms of your
question, it is about confidence.

1738
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:36.119
question, it is about confidence.
The first time when the track and

1739
00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.577
The first time when the track and
trace system is fully operational we

1740
00:57:37.577 --> 00:57:40.327
trace system is fully operational we
will be ahead of the virus, not

1741
00:57:40.327 --> 00:57:44.119
will be ahead of the virus, not
behind it. If there is a spike in

1742
00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:45.202
behind it. If there is a spike in
Wimbledon or in Stratford—upon—Avon,

1743
00:57:45.202 --> 00:57:45.785
Wimbladon or in Stratford-upon-Avon,
we will be

1744
00:57:45.785 --> 00:57:47.119
Wimbledon or in Stratford—upon—Avon,
we will be ahead of it and that way

1745
00:57:47.119 --> 00:57:47.452
we will be ahead of it and that way
we ran

1746
00:57:47.452 --> 00:57:49.785
we will be ahead of it and that way
we can react very quickly with the

1747
00:57:49.785 --> 00:57:50.035
we ran react very quickly with the
[oral

1748
00:57:50.035 --> 00:57:50.952
we can react very quickly with the
local authority to control the virus

1749
00:57:50.952 --> 00:57:51.619
[oral authority to control the virus
in the

1750
00:57:51.619 --> 00:57:53.660
local authority to control the virus
in the area so we do not have to

1751
00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:53.785
in the area so we do not have to
dose

1752
00:57:53.785 --> 00:57:55.827
in the area so we do not have to
close down the whole country as we

1753
00:57:55.827 --> 00:57:55.910
close down the whola country as we
and

1754
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:57.619
close down the whole country as we
and other countries have been doing

1755
00:57:57.619 --> 00:57:58.869
and other countries have been doing
because the pandemic has been

1756
00:57:58.869 --> 00:58:00.535
because the pandemic has been
spreading so quickly around the

1757
00:58:00.535 --> 00:58:04.327
spreading so quickly around the
world. We have got very little time

1758
00:58:04.327 --> 00:58:08.494
world. We have got very little time
left. When will we get to 50,000

1759
00:58:08.494 --> 00:58:08.702
left. when will we get to 50,000
traces?

1760
00:58:08.702 --> 00:58:11.160
left. When will we get to 50,000
traces? When will the app to be

1761
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:11.535
traces? when will the app to be
ready? We

1762
00:58:11.535 --> 00:58:12.535
traces? When will the app to be
ready? We are working ﬂat out, we

1763
00:58:12.535 --> 00:58:14.244
ready? We are working ﬂat out, we
want to make sure it does everything

1764
00:58:14.244 --> 00:58:16.702
want to make sure it does everything
it needs to do and it will be in

1765
00:58:16.702 --> 00:58:18.285
it needs to do and it will be in
place this month. I cannot give you

1766
00:58:18.285 --> 00:58:19.827
place this month. I rannot give you
an exact

1767
00:58:19.827 --> 00:58:21.785
place this month. I cannot give you
an exact date. It will be in place

1768
00:58:21.785 --> 00:58:24.910
an exact date. It will be in place
this month? Let me be clear, the app

1769
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:28.785
this month? Let me be clear, the app
will be up and running this month?

1770
00:58:28.785 --> 00:58:29.577
will be up and mnning this month?
It was mnning in

1771
00:58:29.577 --> 00:58:30.619
will be up and running this month?
It was running in the Isle of Wight

1772
00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:30.994
It was mnning in the Isla of Night
and we

1773
00:58:30.994 --> 00:58:32.494
It was running in the Isle of Wight
and we will make sure it will be run

1774
00:58:32.494 --> 00:58:33.160
and we will make sure it will be nm
as soon as

1775
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.119
and we will make sure it will be run
as soon as we think it is robust. It

1776
00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:38.577
as soon as we think it is robust. It
will be in place this month? It will

1777
00:58:38.577 --> 00:58:39.952
will be in place this month? It will
be rolled out across the UK this

1778
00:58:39.952 --> 00:58:43.202
be rolled out across the UK this
month? I would like to think we can

1779
00:58:43.202 --> 00:58:44.702
month? I would like to think we ran
do it by this

1780
00:58:44.702 --> 00:58:46.410
month? I would like to think we can
do it by this month, yes. We will

1806
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.785
Welcome to the month—long party.

1807
00:59:58.785 --> 01:00:00.952
Brilliant! Brilliant goal!

1808
01:00:00.952 --> 01:00:02.494
It’s unbelievable!

1809
01:00:02.494 --> 01:00:04.410
One of the most sensational matches

1810
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.369
the European Championship
has ever seen!

1811
01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:09.410
What a turn, what a goal!

1812
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.119
I don’t believe it!

1813
01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:14.327
He has only gone and done it!

1814
01:00:14.327 --> 01:00:16.244
Not many players can do that.

1815
01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:18.660
I have never, ever witnessed
anything like this.

1816
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.994
who said there
were too many repeats on the BBC?

1817
01:00:20.994 --> 01:00:22.744
Rewind to the best of the Euros.

1818
01:00:28.452 --> 01:00:30.535
How did last night end?

1819
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.327
I’m starting to write
about my experiences.

1820
01:00:36.327 --> 01:00:38.327
First time?

1821
01:00:38.327 --> 01:00:39.702
Yeah.

1822
01:00:40.827 --> 01:00:42.702
SIRENS WAIL

1823
01:00:42.702 --> 01:00:44.452
HORNS BLARE

1824
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.452
Where does it go?

1825
01:00:56.535 --> 01:00:59.535
# You don’t have to say you love me

1826
01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:01.619
# Just be close at hand...

1827
01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:02.702
LAUGHTER

1828
01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:05.827
# You don’t have to stay forever

1829
01:01:05.827 --> 01:01:08.369
# I will understand...

1830
01:01:09.577 --> 01:01:11.410
Heroes only get the girl
in Hollywood.

1831
01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.535
# Believe me...

1832
01:01:13.535 --> 01:01:15.077
HE CHUCKLES

1833
01:01:15.077 --> 01:01:20.994
# Believe me... #

1834
01:01:20.994 --> 01:01:22.119
Killing Eve...

1835
01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.994
This has not been a good
week for my fragile ego

1836
01:01:48.994 --> 01:01:52.077
because I was flicking
through Good Housekeeping magazine,

1837
01:01:52.077 --> 01:01:55.535
Kirstie Allsopp on the front cover,
but, on page 3A, Vicki Young,

1838
01:01:55.535 --> 01:01:58.994
chief political
correspondent, it’s you!

1839
01:01:58.994 --> 01:02:00.035
It’s me!

1840
01:02:00.035 --> 01:02:02.077
I know, it’s incredible!

1841
01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:03.244
How did that happen?

1842
01:02:03.244 --> 01:02:05.619
Very interesting, especially hearing
that Clark Kent inspired

1843
01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:07.327
you to be a journalist.

1844
01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:09.494
And then things get
even worse for my ego.

1845
01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:14.452
This week’s Grazia, page
nine, Chart of Lust,

1846
01:02:15.285 --> 01:02:19.202
next to Michaeljordan,
Chris Mason!

1847
01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:20.244
Hello.

1848
01:02:20.244 --> 01:02:21.452
In the Chart of Lust.

1849
01:02:21.452 --> 01:02:22.869
What page were you on, Vicki?

1850
01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:23.952
34?

1851
01:02:23.952 --> 01:02:25.410
0h, stop it!

1852
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.160
Chris, you’re in the Chart of Lust
alongside Michaeljordan,

1853
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.077
Alexis from Schitt’s Creek and (“ardi
B.

1854
01:02:31.077 --> 01:02:32.285
Big Cardi B fan?

1855
01:02:32.285 --> 01:02:35.369
It’s nothing to do
with my winter outfits.

1856
01:02:35.369 --> 01:02:38.660
I think Cardi was marginally
above me in the chart,

1857
01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.119
but there’s always next week.

1858
01:02:40.119 --> 01:02:41.785
She is, but she wasn’t on Gogglebox.

1859
01:02:41.785 --> 01:02:42.827
How was that?

1860
01:02:42.827 --> 01:02:44.369
To make matters even worse!

1861
01:02:44.369 --> 01:02:45.785
It all came about...

1862
01:02:45.785 --> 01:02:49.327
The brief story is it came
about because we’re now having,

1863
01:02:49.327 --> 01:02:52.869
in the absence of make—up people,
to use technological

1864
01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:57.035
gadgetry when we appear
on the telly, like this.

1865
01:02:57.035 --> 01:02:58.077
Good morning.

1866
01:02:58.077 --> 01:03:00.244
Welcome to Breakfast
with Chris Mason and Rachel Burden.

1867
01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:01.327
I like Chris Mason.

1868
01:03:01.327 --> 01:03:05.077
I like the confidence he has
to part his hair in the middle.

1869
01:03:05.077 --> 01:03:06.577
I love it!

1870
01:03:06.577 --> 01:03:08.327
Did you catch Eurovision last night?

1871
01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:09.535
Yes, we did.

1872
01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:10.785
We watched it!

1873
01:03:10.785 --> 01:03:12.660
Did I BLEEP, Chris!

1874
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.494
The Coronavirus Newscast
from the BBC.

1875
01:03:21.285 --> 01:03:23.702
Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

1876
01:03:23.702 --> 01:03:25.160
And Vicki Young in the studio.

1877
01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.577
And Chris in my socially—distant
cupboard of news.

1878
01:03:27.577 --> 01:03:29.869
Just down the corridor.

1879
01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:33.494
Now, a long—running theme
of this podcast, Vicki,

1880
01:03:33.494 --> 01:03:38.452
has been face masks or,
as we call them now, face coverings,

1881
01:03:38.494 --> 01:03:43.077
and the advice that has changed
through time in different parts

1882
01:03:43.077 --> 01:03:46.660
of the UK about when and when not
to wear them and how to wear

1883
01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.202
them safely if you do.

1884
01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:52.077
Cast your mind back to the 3rd
of April and whenJonathan Van—Tam,

1885
01:03:52.077 --> 01:03:56.410
the Deputy Chief Medical Officer
for England, said this.

1886
01:03:56.410 --> 01:04:01.452
There is no evidence that general
wearing of face masks by the public

1887
01:04:01.577 --> 01:04:06.619
who are well affects the spread
of the disease in our society.

1888
01:04:06.994 --> 01:04:10.869
What matters right now
is social distancing.

1889
01:04:10.869 --> 01:04:13.744
And what is the government saying
about masks right now?

1890
01:04:13.744 --> 01:04:17.119
Well, the announcement came today —
from the 15th ofJune in England it

1891
01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:21.160
will be compulsory to wear a face
covering of some kind

1892
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.244
on public transport —
something that, for example,

1893
01:04:24.244 --> 01:04:26.327
the Mayor of London,
Sadiq Khan, has been talking

1894
01:04:26.327 --> 01:04:30.452
about for almost two months —
and, if you don’t do that,

1895
01:04:30.452 --> 01:04:33.952
you will not be allowed to travel
and you could end up being fined.

1896
01:04:33.952 --> 01:04:38.952
The government has, I think,
reluctantly eventually ended up

1897
01:04:39.077 --> 01:04:41.785
in this place and inevitably
lots of people are saying,

1898
01:04:41.785 --> 01:04:44.660
this is far too slow,
why didn’t you do it ages ago?

1899
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.535
And the government are saying,
now is the time to do it

1900
01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:49.244
because we’re starting
to open things up.

1901
01:04:49.244 --> 01:04:51.285
Here’s how Grant Shapps,
the Transport Secretary,

1902
01:04:51.285 --> 01:04:54.827
broke it to the plane,
train, bus and tram—using

1903
01:04:54.827 --> 01:04:58.869
public today.

1904
01:04:58.869 --> 01:05:03.244
As of Monday the 15th ofJune,
face coverings will become mandatory

1905
01:05:03.244 --> 01:05:06.785
on public transport.

1906
01:05:06.785 --> 01:05:08.952
That doesn’t mean surgical
masks, which we must keep

1907
01:05:08.952 --> 01:05:11.869
for clinical settings.

1908
01:05:11.869 --> 01:05:16.202
It means the kind of face covering
you can easily make at home.
