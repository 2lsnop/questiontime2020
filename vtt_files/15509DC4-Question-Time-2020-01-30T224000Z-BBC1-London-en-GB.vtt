the majority of the blame for
failures of Northern Rail? Northern

83
00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:40.869
failures of Northern Rail? Northern
Rail, which I imagine quite a lot of

Rail, which I imagine quite a lot of
you use here in the audience, since

85
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:45.827
you use here in the audience, since
it is the only line I think you can

86
00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:46.202
it is the only line I think you ran
use from

87
00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:47.786
it is the only line I think you can
use from Buxton. Sarah, do you want

88
00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:51.577
use from Buxton. Sarah, do you want
to kick as off? Just been taken back

89
00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:51.786
to kick as off? just been taken back
into

90
00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:52.952
to kick as off? Just been taken back
into government control? It has,

91
00:03:52.952 --> 00:03:54.827
into government control? It has,
renationalising it. Good to see they

92
00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:57.077
renationalising it. Good to see they
are following our lead. The

93
00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:58.827
are following our lead. The
government has no real strategy.

94
00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:00.911
government has no real strategy.
Chris Grayling, we remember,

95
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.952
Chris Grayling, we remember,
famously said I am not in charge of

96
00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:07.161
famously said I am not in charge of
the trains. Most of you will have

97
00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:08.577
the trains. Most of you will have
suffered under Northern Rail and

98
00:04:08.577 --> 00:04:10.577
suffered under Northern Rail and
most of us have suffered under the

99
00:04:10.577 --> 00:04:13.202
most of us have suffered under the
rail network as we find it now. This

100
00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:16.786
rail network as we find it now. This
is the second line now that the

101
00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:17.744
is the second line now that the
government have decided to

102
00:04:17.744 --> 00:04:19.327
government have decided to
renationalise, only on a temporary

103
00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:21.286
renationalise, only on a temporary
way. The question is why did it take

104
00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:23.411
way. The question is why did it take
so long? We knew it was rubbish for

105
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.494
so long? We knew it was rubbish for
so long before they acted. Why

106
00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.244
so long before they acted. why
didn’t they

107
00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:28.077
so long before they acted. Why
didn’t they act faster? And what

108
00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:30.411
didn’t they act faster? And what
reassurances have they put in place?

109
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:32.536
reassurances have they put in place?
None yet, that was say actually we

110
00:04:32.536 --> 00:04:34.661
None yet, that was say actually we
will stop the delays, reinvest in

111
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.911
will stop the delays, reinvest in
the infrastructure and we will make

112
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:36.994
the infrastmclure and we will make
sure we get a

113
00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:38.452
the infrastructure and we will make
sure we get a better deal for

114
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:40.452
sure we get a better deal for
customers. For me, rail

115
00:04:40.452 --> 00:04:42.077
customers. For me, rail
nationalisation make sense partly

116
00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:43.494
nationalisation make sense partly
because it’s actually quite simple.

117
00:04:43.494 --> 00:04:45.744
because it’s actually quite simple.
There are no assets you have to buy

118
00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.494
There are no assets you have to buy
back when the franchises come up,

119
00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:48.119
back when the franchises come up,
you ran take

120
00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.202
back when the franchises come up,
you can take them into public

121
00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:49.661
you ran take them into public
control

122
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.077
you can take them into public
control and say let’s put customers

123
00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:54.494
control and say let’s put customers
first, service first, security first

124
00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.994
first, service first, security first
and let’s make sure we run the rail

125
00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:57.619
and let’s make sure we nm the rail
companies in the

126
00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:58.744
and let’s make sure we run the rail
companies in the way that works for

127
00:04:58.744 --> 00:05:00.286
companies in the way that works for
us and not just

128
00:05:00.286 --> 00:05:01.202
companies in the way that works for
us and notjust for those privatised

129
00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:01.661
us and not just for those privatised
companies. I

130
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:01.869
us and notjust for those privatised
companies. I think,

131
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.994
us and notjust for those privatised
companies. Ithink, why

132
00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:02.661
us and notjust for those privatised
companies. I think, why didn’t they

133
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:04.661
companies. I think, why didn’t they
do it before, why has it taken so

134
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.827
do it before, why has it taken so
long, why don’t we go further?

135
00:05:07.827 --> 00:05:10.494
long, why don’t we go further?

franchising is absolutely welcomed.

143
00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:27.994
franchising is absolutely welcomed.
It is long, long overdue. I think

144
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.536
It is long, long overdue. I think
the difference between London

145
00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:32.077
the difference between London
transport and the transport in the

146
00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:33.911
transport and the transport in the
North is an absolute disgrace. It’s

147
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.661
North is an absolute disgrace. It’s
like comparing the premiership in

148
00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:38.244
like comparing the premiership in
London to Vauxhall conference

149

London to Vauxhall conference
league. The mayors in the North,

150

league. The mayors in the North,
Steve Rotherham and Andy Burnham, on

151
00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.369
Steve Rotherham and Andy Burnham, on
a daily basis have been complaining

152
00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:47.952
a daily basis have been complaining
to the government. I know people who

153
00:05:47.952 --> 00:05:49.119
to the government. I know people who
have lost their jobs

154
00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.702
to the government. I know people who
have lost theirjobs because they

155
00:05:49.702 --> 00:05:51.994
have lost theirjobs because they
have been waiting for these old

156
00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:53.244
have been waiting for these old
trains to turn up, they’re

157
00:05:53.244 --> 00:05:55.161
trains to turn up, they’re
cancelled, they turn up late, they

158
00:05:55.161 --> 00:05:56.411
cancelled, they turn up late, they
are consistently late for work and

159
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:58.202
are consistently late for work and
when they do get on them, they are

160
00:05:58.202 --> 00:06:01.411
when they do get on them, they are
overcrowded. It is not right. Why

161
00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:02.494
overcrowded. It is not right. why
does a

162
00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:05.827
overcrowded. It is not right. Why
does a bus in London cost £1, a bus

163
00:06:05.827 --> 00:06:10.369
does a bus in London cost £1, a bus
in Manchester costs £A? There is a

164
00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.911
in Manchester costs £4? There is a
great

165
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:11.119
in Manchester costs £A? There is a
great integrated

166
00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.827
in Manchester costs fir? There is a
great integrated transport system in

167
00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:14.911
great integrated transport system in
London that is capped at £10. In

168
00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:15.077
London that is rapped at £10. In
Greater

169
00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:16.619
London that is capped at £10. In
Greater Manchester, you can spend

170
00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:17.286
Greater Manchester, you ran spend
20- BO

171
00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:17.536
Greater Manchester, you can spend
20- £30 in

172
00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:19.411
Greater Manchester, you can spend
20— £30 in a day. I think it’s not

173
00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:20.244
20- £30 in a day. I think it’s not
fair and it’s great

174
00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:21.036
20— £30 in a day. I think it’s not
fair and it’s great we have seen a

175
00:06:21.036 --> 00:06:22.119
fair and it’s great we have seen a
slight sign the government are

176
00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.702
slight sign the government are
listening to what we in Greater

177
00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:27.036
listening to what we in Greater
Manchester and Buxton have been

178
00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:30.161
Manchester and Buxton have been
asking for. It’s about time, it’s

179
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:33.244
asking for. It’s about time, it’s
long, long overdue. APPLAUSE

180
00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:40.286
So the question, James, is how much

181
00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:41.202
So the question, james, is how much
should the

182
00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:42.327
So the question, James, is how much
should the Department for Transport

183
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:44.661
should the Department for Transport
and the Treasury, the government,

184
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:45.869
and the Treasury, the government,
shoulder the blame for the failures

185
00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:50.244
shoulder the blame for the failures
of Northern Rail. There are those

186
00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.869
of Northern Rail. There are those
who argue that the timetable was set

187
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.911
who argue that the timetable was set
for Northern Rail by the government

188
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:55.036
for Northern Rail by the government
and was undeliverable and the

189
00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:56.244
and was undeliverable and the
infrastructure was not there. The

190
00:06:56.244 --> 00:06:56.702
infrastmclure was not there. The
new railway

191
00:06:56.702 --> 00:06:59.202
infrastructure was not there. The
new railway lines were not there,

192
00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:00.036
new railway lines were not there,
the updates Manchester Piccadilly

193
00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:01.286
the updates Manchester Piccadilly
just went there in order for

194
00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:03.411
just went there in order for
Northern Rail... I’m not saying they

195
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:06.202
Northern Rail... I’m not saying they
have done everything right but the

196
00:07:06.202 --> 00:07:08.952
have done everything right but the
Northern Rail to deliver the

197
00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:10.411
Northern Rail to deliver the
timetable in 2018, when hundreds of

198
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:10.536
timetabla in 2018, when hundreds of
trains

199
00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:13.786
timetable in 2018, when hundreds of
trains were cancelled in a day?

200
00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:14.661
trains were ancellad in a day?
Well, it’s

201
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:15.327
trains were cancelled in a day?
Well, it’s absolutely right that the

202
00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:16.952
Well, it’s absolutely right that the
government has taken Northern Rail

203
00:07:16.952 --> 00:07:19.244
government has taken Northern Rail
or is in the process of taking

204
00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:23.036
or is in the process of taking
Northern Rail back into public

205
00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:23.994
Northern Rail back into public
ownership, public management. How

206
00:07:23.994 --> 00:07:25.786
ownership, public management. How
much do you take the blame for what

207
00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:28.286
much do you take the blame for what
has happened at Northern Rail? I

208
00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.994
has happened at Northern Rail? I
think we should remind ourselves

209
00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:33.286
think we should remind ourselves
that the franchising of our rail

210
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.411
that the franchising of our rail
network has seen record levels of

211
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:37.702
network has seen record levels of
investment, record increases in

212
00:07:37.702 --> 00:07:42.244
investment, record increases in
passenger numbers. The government is

213
00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:43.911
passenger numbers. The government is
now committed to extending the rail

214
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.452
now committed to extending the rail
network so it reaches more parts of

215
00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:46.869
network so it reaches more parts of
the country forced at Northern Rail

216
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:48.744
the country forced at Northern Rail
has not worked and that is why

217
00:07:48.744 --> 00:07:51.661
has not worked and that is why
Northern Rail has been brought back

218
00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:53.952
Northern Rail has been brought back
into public ownership. Do you think

219
00:07:53.952 --> 00:07:56.202
into public ownership. Do you think
the government has any role in

220
00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:58.244
the government has any role in
Northern Rail not working? The

221
00:07:58.244 --> 00:07:59.994
Northern Rail not working? The
government always has a role to play

222
00:07:59.994 --> 00:08:01.619
government always has a rola to play
in a public

223
00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:02.202
government always has a role to play
in a public transport network but

224
00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:03.494
in a public transport network but
the vast majority of the rail

225
00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:06.036
the vast majority of the rail
network in the country, we have seen

226
00:08:06.036 --> 00:08:07.286
network in the country, we have seen
increased passenger numbers,

227
00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.411
increased passenger numbers,
increased investment, new rolling

228
00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:11.661
increased investment, new rolling
stock. That has not happened in

229
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.077
stock. That has not happened in
Northern Rail. The pace of trains

230
00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.911
Northern Rail. The pace of trains
are long, long past their sell by

231
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:16.994
are long, long past their sell by
date. The Prime Minister made it

232
00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:18.994
date. The Prime Minister made it
clear when he was campaigning that

233
00:08:18.994 --> 00:08:21.369
clear when he was campaigning that
that would be resolved. I’m very

234
00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.077
that would be resolved. I’m very
pleased to see he is once again

235
00:08:23.077 --> 00:08:25.536
pleased to see he is once again
delivering on the promises he made

236
00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:26.661
delivering on the promises he made
in his leadership campaign. The

237
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:28.202
in his leadership campaign. The
promises we made in the general

238
00:08:28.202 --> 00:08:29.411
promises we made in the general
election campaign and we are getting

239
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:30.244
elaction campaign and we are getting
a grip on what

240
00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:32.202
election campaign and we are getting
a grip on what has been a failing

241
00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:35.702
a grip on what has been a failing
service. Right, quite a few hands

242
00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:38.202
service. Right, quite a few hands
up. You, sir? I’ve been a Northern

243
00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:39.661
up. You, sir? I’ve been a Northern
Rail customer for the last three to

244
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:42.411
Rail customer for the last three to
four years. What would you call it?

245
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.536
four years. what would you all it?
A disgrace is

246
00:08:43.536 --> 00:08:44.119
four years. What would you call it?
A disgrace is probably the polite

247
00:08:44.119 --> 00:08:45.994
A disgrace is probably the polite
term. The first thing I do in the

248
00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:47.994
term. The first thing I do in the
morning when my alarm goes off is

249
00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.327
morning when my alarm goes off is
which train is cancelled and if I

250
00:08:49.327 --> 00:08:50.369
which train is ancellad and if I
will get to

251
00:08:50.369 --> 00:08:51.494
which train is cancelled and if I
will get to work on time. I agree,

252
00:08:51.494 --> 00:08:52.994
will get to work on time. I agree,
if there is the south of the border

253
00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:55.244
if there is the south of the border
it would have been fixed yesterday.

254
00:08:55.244 --> 00:08:56.994
it would have been fixed yesterday.
As commuters, we welcome it but what

255
00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:59.369
As commuters, we welcome it but what
will happen in the next two or three

256
00:08:59.369 --> 00:08:59.952
will happen in the next two or three
years? will we

257
00:08:59.952 --> 00:09:00.661
will happen in the next two or three
years? Will we see an immediate

258
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:01.244
years? will we see an immediate
change or will

259
00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:03.119
years? Will we see an immediate
change or will we have to wait even

260
00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:04.494
change or will we have to wait even
longer for that?

261
00:09:04.494 --> 00:09:06.369

take you to task when you say there

take you to task when you say there
is more investment in the railways.

268
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:12.827
is more investment in the railways.
MY

My sons work in London. They go to

My sons work in London. They go to

272
00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:23.911
last ticket he bought was £160 and
he didn’t get a seat. Now, it’s

273
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.827
he didn’t get a seat. Now, it’s
almost impacting on family and now,

274
00:09:26.827 --> 00:09:28.411
almost impacting on family and now,
that families cannot go around the

that families rannot go around the
country and

276
00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:30.119
that families cannot go around the
country and be transported on your

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:32.661
country and be transported on your
railway network because of the

278
00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:36.077
railway network because of the
overcrowding, the expense, the

279
00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:37.536
overcrowding, the expense, the
delays, the cancellations. It’s an

280
00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:38.411
delays, the cancellations. It’s an
absolute joke.

281
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.119
delays, the cancellations. It’s an
absolutejoke. The railway network

282
00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:41.911

The announcement has only just come
out. I

313
00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:26.036
The announcement has only just come
out. Iran’t

314
00:10:26.036 --> 00:10:27.119
The announcement has onlyjust come
out. I can’t and I am not in a

315
00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:28.827
out. I can’t and I am not in a
position to give you the kind of

316
00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:30.827
position to give you the kind of
detail that you are asking for at

317
00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:31.994
detail that you are asking for at
the moment. The reason the

318
00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:33.869
the moment. The reason the
government has taken it in houses

319
00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:38.036
government has taken it in houses
because we have listened to the

320
00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:39.619
because we have listened to the
anger and the complaints from people

321
00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:39.786
anger and the complaints from peopla
that

322
00:10:39.786 --> 00:10:43.661
anger and the complaints from people
that use a service and we are

323
00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:44.827
that use a service and we are
responding to that. The Prime

324
00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:45.911
responding to that. The Prime
Minister has said is enough is

325
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:48.077
Minister has said is enough is
enough, you have had enough second

326
00:10:48.077 --> 00:10:49.244
enough, you have had enough second
chances, no more excuses, we are

327
00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:51.661
chances, no more excuses, we are
taking this off you, we’re going to

328
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:52.786
taking this off you, we’re going to
make improvements, going to make

329
00:10:52.786 --> 00:10:55.077
make improvements, going to make
sure there is more rolling stock and

330
00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:56.327
sure there is more rolling stock and
that it services the people that

331
00:10:56.327 --> 00:11:00.411
that it services the people that
rely on for work and to get... To

332
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:03.577
rely on for work and to get... To
see family or whatever reason you

333
00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:06.036
see family or whatever reason you
might use the train service. The

334
00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:07.702
might use the train service. The
gentleman who said the differential

335
00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:08.661
gentleman who said the differential
between transport investment in the

336
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:10.786
between transport investment in the
south of the country in the north of

337
00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:12.661
south of the country in the north of
the country is completely out of

338
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:13.994
the country is completely out of
kilter is absolutely right. This is

339
00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:18.911
kilter is absolutely right. This is
one of the big lessons that I think

340
00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:19.661
one of the big lassons that I think
politicians

341
00:11:19.661 --> 00:11:20.452
one of the big lessons that I think
politicians should have learned a

342
00:11:20.452 --> 00:11:23.827
politicians should have learned a
number of years ago... In the last

343
00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:24.661
number of years ago... In the last
ten years? when

344
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:25.369
number of years ago... In the last
ten years? When millions of people

345
00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:25.911
ten years? when millions of peopla
in the country

346
00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:27.119
ten years? When millions of people
in the country said we are not happy

347
00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.119
in the country said we are not happy
with the status quo. The

348
00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:29.161
with the status quo. The
Conservative Party took that lesson

349
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:29.327
Conservative Party took that lasson
on

350
00:11:29.327 --> 00:11:31.369
Conservative Party took that lesson
on board which is why we are taking

351
00:11:31.369 --> 00:11:33.619
on board which is why we are taking
a very different approach to

352
00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:34.994
a very different approach to
regional policy and making sure we

353
00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:36.327
regional policy and making sure we
increase the investment in the North

354
00:11:36.327 --> 00:11:40.786
increase the investment in the North
of England. Will you level up?

355
00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:42.161
of England. Will you level up?
Absolutely, the Prime Minister made

356
00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:43.494
Absolutely, the Prime Minister made
that commitment and this is the

357
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:45.327
that commitment and this is the
first of a number of delivery on the

358
00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:48.952
first of a number of delivery on the
promises that we made. For me, we

359
00:11:48.952 --> 00:11:51.119
promises that we made. For me, we
are talking about trains, it’s not

360
00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:53.827
are talking about trains, it’s not
just poor trains in the north but

361
00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:56.286
just poor trains in the north but
poor transport in general. We have

362
00:11:56.286 --> 00:11:57.244
poor transport in general. We have
sat here in

363
00:11:57.244 --> 00:11:58.786
poor transport in general. We have
set here in Buxton. Buxton is an

364
00:11:58.786 --> 00:11:59.161
sat here in Buxton. Buxton is an
absolute

365
00:11:59.161 --> 00:12:00.827
set here in Buxton. Buxton is an
absolute bottleneck for traffic,

366
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:02.577
absolute bottleneck for traffic,
it’s an absolute nightmare. I’m sure

367
00:12:02.577 --> 00:12:04.536
it’s an absolute nightmare. I’m sure
you are aware of that. I was amazed

368
00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:07.327
you are aware of that. I was amazed
today that I had two major cities,

369
00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:09.036
today that I had two major cities,
Manchester and Sheffield, had the

370
00:12:09.036 --> 00:12:10.411
Manchester and Sheffield, had the
poorest connection between the two

371
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.286
poorest connection between the two
cities in the whole of Europe. They

372
00:12:12.286 --> 00:12:15.661
cities in the whole of Europe. They
are major cities. It needs looking

373
00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:17.744
are major cities. It needs looking
at and quickly. I think we need to

374
00:12:17.744 --> 00:12:20.202
at and quickly. I think we need to
be giving more powers to people

375
00:12:20.202 --> 00:12:21.577
be giving more powers to peopla
locally. The

376
00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:22.119
be giving more powers to people
locally. The people in Westminster

377
00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:22.327
locally. The peopla in Westminster
don’t

378
00:12:22.327 --> 00:12:24.244
locally. The people in Westminster
don’t know what’s best for people in

379
00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.119
don’t know what’s best for people in
Greater Manchester. We need more

380
00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:27.327
Greater Manchester. We need more
powers in Greater Manchester. 50,

381
00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:31.036
powers in Greater Manchester. So,
for example,

382
00:12:31.036 --> 00:12:31.827
powers in Greater Manchester. 50,
for example, the mayor of Greater

383
00:12:31.827 --> 00:12:32.786
for example, the mayor of Greater
Manchester, Liverpool... They need

384
00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.661
Manchester, Liverpool... They need
the powers, they know what is right

385
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:36.994
the powers, they know what is right
to the buses and trains. We need to

386
00:12:36.994 --> 00:12:40.744
to the buses and trains. We need to
have more power devolved up here.

387
00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:44.661
have more power devolved up here.
Minutes? Behalf of the members I

388
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:45.452
Minutes? Behalf of the members I
represent, 10,000 farmers across

389
00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:45.911
represent, 47,000 farmers across
England and

390
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:47.244
represent, 10,000 farmers across
England and Wales, 3 lot of them are

391
00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:51.077
England and Walas, a lot of them are
living in very

392
00:12:51.077 --> 00:12:51.577
England and Wales, 3 lot of them are
living in very rural communities,

393
00:12:51.577 --> 00:12:51.827
living in very mral communities,
pub“:

394
00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:52.452
living in very rural communities,
public transport absolutely vital

395
00:12:52.452 --> 00:12:55.077
public transport absolutely vital
for them and I would very much agree

396
00:12:55.077 --> 00:12:56.286
for them and I would very much agree
with what Sacha says in the

397
00:12:56.286 --> 00:12:58.161
with what Sacha says in the
gentleman in the blue at the back. I

398
00:12:58.161 --> 00:13:00.327
gentleman in the blue at the back. I
think this has been London centric.

399
00:13:00.327 --> 00:13:03.244
think this has been London centric.
We have had a two tier public

400
00:13:03.244 --> 00:13:04.952
We have had a two tier public
transport system and it is failing

401
00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.161
transport system and it is failing
and it is failing very many parts of

402
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.744
and it is failing very many parts of
the country that need it most. 50 we

403
00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:10.036
the country that need it most. So we
have to

404
00:13:10.036 --> 00:13:10.952
the country that need it most. 50 we
have to prioritise the investment. I

405
00:13:10.952 --> 00:13:13.452
have to prioritise the investment. I
think it is great that it is being

406
00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:14.994
think it is great that it is being
brought back in—house but we cannot

407
00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:15.494
brought back in-house but we cannot
tarry on

408
00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:15.619
brought back in-house but we cannot
carry on with

409
00:13:15.619 --> 00:13:16.452
brought back in—house but we cannot
carry on with this two tier system

410
00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:19.619
carry on with this two tier system
and I think there a lot of the

411
00:13:19.619 --> 00:13:20.994
and I think there a lot of the
problems with bricks and anything

412
00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:21.577
problams with bricks and anything
else,

413
00:13:21.577 --> 00:13:22.952
problems with bricks and anything
else, everyone thinks everything is

414
00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:24.369
else, everyone thinks everything is
driven by Londoners in London it is

415
00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:27.077
driven by Londoners in London it is
out of touch with the rural parts of

416
00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:27.827
out of touch with the mral parts of
the country,

417
00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:28.369
out of touch with the rural parts of
the country, particularly in Buxton,

418
00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:29.786
the country, particularty in Buxton,
a very mral part

419
00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:30.827
the country, particularly in Buxton,
a very rural part of the country.

420
00:13:30.827 --> 00:13:31.744
a very mral part of the country.
People feel

421
00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.286
a very rural part of the country.
People feel let down and

422
00:13:33.286 --> 00:13:35.786
People feel let down and
disadvantaged. Geoff Norcott? It’s

423
00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:38.827
disadvantaged. Geoff Norcott? It’s
interesting, this far right Boris

424
00:13:38.827 --> 00:13:38.952
interesting, this far right Boris
johnson

425
00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.536
interesting, this far right Boris
Johnson government and one of the

426
00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:41.244
johnson government and one of the
first act is

427
00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:42.536
Johnson government and one of the
first act is to nationalise a rail

428
00:13:42.536 --> 00:13:43.744
first act is to nationalise a rail
provider. In fairness,

429
00:13:43.744 --> 00:13:44.119
first act is to nationalise a rail
provider. Infairness, I’m have

430
00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:44.994
provider. In fairness, I’m have
given a lot

431
00:13:44.994 --> 00:13:45.327
provider. Infairness, I’m have
given a lot stick to

432
00:13:45.327 --> 00:13:45.786
provider. Infairness, I’m have
given a lot stick toJeremy Corbyn

433
00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:46.369
given a lot stick to jeremy Corbyn
over the

434
00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:47.369
given a lot stick to Jeremy Corbyn
over the years and this is one

435
00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:50.994
over the years and this is one
argument that won the argument. I’m

436
00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:52.286
argument that won the argument. I’m
a little uncomfortable about

437
00:13:52.286 --> 00:13:53.827
a little uncomfortable about
governments getting too involved a

438
00:13:53.827 --> 00:13:55.702
governments getting too involved a
new hope is temporary. But I Sacha

439
00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.327
new hope is temporary. But I Sacha
brought up, the ridiculous thing in

440
00:13:57.327 --> 00:13:58.869
brought up, the ridiculous thing in
this country is the North to South

441
00:13:58.869 --> 00:14:00.286
this country is the North to South
links are the ones away looked at

442
00:14:00.286 --> 00:14:02.202
links are the ones away looked at
that if you want to go side to side,

443
00:14:02.202 --> 00:14:03.744
that if you want to go side to side,
there is some sort of weird

444
00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:05.119
there is some sort of weird
prejudice against that. You might as

445
00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:06.494
prejudice against that. You might as
well just get a

446
00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:06.619
prejudice against that. You might as
welljust get a new

447
00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:06.827
prejudice against that. You might as
well just get a new all.

448
00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:07.577
prejudice against that. You might as
welljust get a new all. Everyone

449
00:14:07.577 --> 00:14:08.869
well just get a new all. Everyone
nodding their

welljust get a new all. Everyone
nodding their heads in the audience.

451
00:14:10.952 --> 00:14:12.202
nodding their heads in the audience.
What’s the prejudice against side to

452
00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:12.702
what’s the prejudice against side to
side quest

453
00:14:12.702 --> 00:14:14.494
What’s the prejudice against side to
side quest about services connecting

Geoff. Julie Ollernshaw? Is HS2 the

468
00:14:42.327 --> 00:14:44.077
Geoff. julie Ollernshaw? Is HSZ the
best way to

469
00:14:44.077 --> 00:14:45.244
Geoff. Julie Ollernshaw? Is HS2 the
best way to spark infrastructure

470
00:14:45.244 --> 00:14:46.244
best way to spark infrastructure
revolution?

471
00:14:46.244 --> 00:14:48.536
revolution?
So, there has been a bit of a

472
00:14:48.536 --> 00:14:49.869
So, there has been a bit of a
meeting today with Boris Johnson,

473
00:14:49.869 --> 00:14:50.077
meeting today with Boris johnson,
with

474
00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:54.661
meeting today with Boris Johnson,
with the Transport Secretary Grant

475
00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:54.786
with the Transport Secretary Grant
Sharps

476
00:14:54.786 --> 00:14:55.827
with the Transport Secretary Grant
Shapps and Sergei Javid.

477
00:14:55.827 --> 00:14:56.161
with the Transport Secretary Grant
Shapps and Sergeijavid. Were

478
00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:56.327
with the Transport Secretary Grant
Shapps and Sergei Javid. Were you

479
00:14:56.327 --> 00:14:56.619
Shapps and Sergei javid. Were you
there,

480
00:14:56.619 --> 00:14:59.036
Shapps and Sergei Javid. Were you
there, James? No, I

481
00:14:59.036 --> 00:14:59.161
Shapps and Sergei Javid. Were you
there, James? No, Iwas

482
00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:00.119
Shapps and Sergei Javid. Were you
there, James? No, I was on my way

483
00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:01.244
there, james? No, I was on my way
here on a

484
00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:02.286
there, James? No, I was on my way
here on a Pacer train. When we were

485
00:15:02.286 --> 00:15:03.786
here on a Pacer train. when we were
on our way here,

486
00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:05.077
here on a Pacer train. When we were
on our way here, the train was

487
00:15:05.077 --> 00:15:07.536
on our way here, the train was
cancelled. Couldn’t get on the first

488
00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:09.244
cancelled. Couldn’t get on the first
train because it was overcrowded, I

489
00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:17.077
train because it was overcrowded, I
feel your pain. The review is

490
00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:19.619
feel your pain. The review is
looking at the whole situation

491
00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:20.994
looking at the whole situation
around HSZ, the cost and the

492
00:15:20.994 --> 00:15:23.202
around HSZ, the cost and the
sequencing and that kind of stuff.

493
00:15:23.202 --> 00:15:27.577
sequencing and that kind of stuff.
Is anyone dissenting in the cabinet?

494
00:15:27.577 --> 00:15:29.202
Is anyone dissenting in the cabinet?
The Cabinet the way cabinets work

495
00:15:29.202 --> 00:15:30.786
The Cabinet the way cabinets work
and the Premier because making this

496
00:15:30.786 --> 00:15:32.827
and the Premier because making this
clear, is we come to a collective

497
00:15:32.827 --> 00:15:33.286
clear, is we come to a collactive
decision in

498
00:15:33.286 --> 00:15:34.827
clear, is we come to a collective
decision in private and then once we

499
00:15:34.827 --> 00:15:37.786
decision in private and then once we
have come to a collective decision,

500
00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:38.327
have come to a collactive decision,
that is the

501
00:15:38.327 --> 00:15:40.494
have come to a collective decision,
that is the decision of the whole

502
00:15:40.494 --> 00:15:41.577
that is the decision of the whole
cabinet, the whole government. That

503
00:15:41.577 --> 00:15:43.452
cabinet, the whole government. That
will be quite a novelty, we haven’t

504
00:15:43.452 --> 00:15:44.327
will be quite a novelty, we haven’t
seen that in quite a

505
00:15:44.327 --> 00:15:44.619
will be quite a novelty, we haven’t
seen that in quite along

506
00:15:44.619 --> 00:15:45.786
will be quite a novelty, we haven’t
seen that in quite a long time!

507
00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:47.577
seen that in quite a long time!
Things are changing under the new

508
00:15:47.577 --> 00:15:48.952
Things are changing under the new
Prime Minister and changing for the

509
00:15:48.952 --> 00:15:51.661
Prime Minister and changing for the
better. You are in favour? I think

510
00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:54.911
better. You are in favour? I think
it’s absolutely key and as Geoff was

511
00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:55.369
it’s absolutely key and as Geoff was
saying, I

512
00:15:55.369 --> 00:15:55.827
it’s absolutely key and as Geoff was
saying, Ithink

513
00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:56.577
it’s absolutely key and as Geoff was
saying, I think there is unanimity

514
00:15:56.577 --> 00:15:58.827
saying, I think there is unanimity
on the panel here, that’s big parts

515
00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:01.036
on the panel here, that’s big parts
of the country, particularly in the

516
00:16:01.036 --> 00:16:01.577
of the country, particularty in the
North of

517
00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:03.494
of the country, particularly in the
North of England, have not been as

518
00:16:03.494 --> 00:16:04.827
North of England, have not been as
well serviced by public transport

519
00:16:04.827 --> 00:16:07.536
well serviced by public transport
and other things as they should be.

520
00:16:07.536 --> 00:16:10.619
and other things as they should be.
And making sure that that is

521
00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:11.827
And making sure that that is
addressed is absolutely a priority.

522
00:16:11.827 --> 00:16:12.952
addressed is absolutely a priority.
HSZ is

523
00:16:12.952 --> 00:16:14.411
addressed is absolutely a priority.
HS2 is one of the options, obviously

524
00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:14.869
HSZ is one of the options, obviously
there are

525
00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:16.536
HS2 is one of the options, obviously
there are concerns about some of the

526
00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:18.119
there are concerns about some of the
cost projections about that and that

527
00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:21.452
cost projections about that and that
will need to be looked at. But the

528
00:16:21.452 --> 00:16:24.077
will need to be looked at. But the
broader point I want to make is the

529
00:16:24.077 --> 00:16:25.036
broader point I want to make is the
government is absolutely committed

530
00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:27.786
government is absolutely committed
to making sure that the whole of the

531
00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:28.619
to making sure that the whola of the
country in

532
00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:29.827
to making sure that the whole of the
country in every community across

533
00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:30.786
country in every community across
the country, is properly connected

534
00:16:30.786 --> 00:16:31.202
the country, is property connected
and ran

535
00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:32.661
the country, is properly connected
and can feel the benefit of the

536
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:33.619
and ran feel the benefit of the
growth in

537
00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:34.327
and can feel the benefit of the
growth in the UK economy? Julie,

538
00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:34.952
growth in the UK economy? julie,
what is your

539
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:39.411
growth in the UK economy? Julie,
what is your view?

540
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:39.536
ﬂ

541
00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:42.411
I think we are better to be able to
cross the country by Northern Rail

542
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:45.119
cross the country by Northern Rail
rather than HS2

543
00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:45.994
cross the country by Northern Rail
rather than H52 and the amount of

544
00:16:45.994 --> 00:16:47.702
rather than H52 and the amount of
money and, by the time it gets to

545
00:16:47.702 --> 00:16:48.827
money and, by the time it gets to
the north, whether it will be

546
00:16:48.827 --> 00:16:54.119
the north, whether it will be
obsolete. The man at the front. I

547
00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:54.369
obsolate. The man at the front. I
think

548
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:57.452
obsolete. The man at the front. I
think there is a brilliant missed

549
00:16:57.452 --> 00:16:58.577
think there is a brilliant missed
opportunity to connect Derby with

550
00:16:58.577 --> 00:17:00.911
opportunity to connect Derby with
Buxton, and therefore Nottingham and

551
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:01.869
Buxton, and therefore Nottingham and
Derby with Manchester, by reopening

552
00:17:01.869 --> 00:17:05.244
Derby with Manchester, by reopening
a line which is 12 miles long and

553
00:17:05.244 --> 00:17:05.327
a line which is 12 mils long and
probably

554
00:17:05.327 --> 00:17:06.661
a line which is 12 miles long and
probably wouldn’t cost as much as

555
00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:06.911
probably wouldn’t cost as much as
HSZ,

556
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:11.494
probably wouldn’t cost as much as
H52, and that is a whole, you know,

557
00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:12.661
H52, and that is a whole, you know,
you could get a connection from

558
00:17:12.661 --> 00:17:13.994
you could get a connection from
Lincoln to Nottingham, and that

559
00:17:13.994 --> 00:17:16.494
Lincoln to Nottingham, and that
would connect the east with the law.

560
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:19.702
would connect the east with the law.
HSZ, is it the best to

561
00:17:19.702 --> 00:17:22.744
HSZ, is it the best to
infrastructure revolution? I think

562
00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:23.286
infrastmclure revolution? I think
we probably

563
00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:24.952
infrastructure revolution? I think
we probably wouldn’t start from this

564
00:17:24.952 --> 00:17:26.577
we probably wouldn’t start from this
point, but the issue with HS2 is

565
00:17:26.577 --> 00:17:26.911
point, but the issue with HSZ is
it’s been

566
00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:29.286
point, but the issue with HS2 is
it’s been going round for ten years,

567
00:17:29.286 --> 00:17:31.327
it’s been going round for ten years,
we’ve spent about 9 billion, a huge

568
00:17:31.327 --> 00:17:32.661
we’ve spent about 9 billion, a huge
amount of money, and 2000 people are

569
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:33.994
amount of money, and 2000 peopla are
working on it.

570
00:17:33.994 --> 00:17:37.702
amount of money, and 2000 people are
working on it. Seven billion already

571
00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:42.369
working on it. Seven billion already
spent. Work is under way, we are not

572
00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:43.827
spent. Work is under way, we are not
starting from scratch, so I think we

573
00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:46.786
starting from scratch, so I think we
have to go for it. This country is

574
00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:48.327
have to go for it. This country is
really bad at finishing large

575
00:17:48.327 --> 00:17:49.494
really bad at finishing large
infrastructure projects, so we have

576
00:17:49.494 --> 00:17:50.036
infrastmclure projects, so we have
to do this,

577
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.744
infrastructure projects, so we have
to do this, but not at the expense

578
00:17:51.744 --> 00:17:53.036
to do this, but not at the expense
of everything else, and we had an

579
00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:54.369
of everything else, and we had an
announcement two years ago from the

580
00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:56.827
announcement two years ago from the
government that they were going to

581
00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:58.202
government that they were going to
reopen all of the tracks that had

582
00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.494
reopen all of the tracks that had
been closed by the preaching review,

583
00:18:00.494 --> 00:18:01.994
been closed by the preaching review,
so 5000 miles worth of tracks that

584
00:18:01.994 --> 00:18:02.077
so 5000 milas worth of tracks that
we

585
00:18:02.077 --> 00:18:07.119
so 5000 miles worth of tracks that
we were

586
00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:09.952
we were promised it was a 500
million funding to help restore some

587
00:18:09.952 --> 00:18:13.786
million funding to help restore some
of the railway lines. They have

588
00:18:13.786 --> 00:18:15.161
of the railway lines. They have
promised £500 million, and I am told

589
00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:17.827
promised £500 million, and I am told
that will get you between 25 and 50

590
00:18:17.827 --> 00:18:19.577
that will get you between 25 and 50
miles worth of track, so the tracks

591
00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:19.786
milas worth of track, so the tracks
that

592
00:18:19.786 --> 00:18:21.619
miles worth of track, so the tracks
that were closed in this area, are

593
00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:24.036
that were closed in this area, are
they going to be reopened or not?

594
00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:26.161
they going to be reopened or not?
Are we going to be looking at some

595
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:27.411
Are we going to be looking at some
of those replacements? There is also

596
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:30.202
of those replacements? There is also
a big review going on at the moment

597
00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:31.202
a big review going on at the moment
the Department for Transport about

598
00:18:31.202 --> 00:18:32.786
the Department for Transport about
whether or not we have a whole new

599
00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:34.202
whether or not we have a whole new
system of the rail network, but it’s

600
00:18:34.202 --> 00:18:35.827
system of the rail network, but it’s
taking a very long time to stop they

601
00:18:35.827 --> 00:18:38.577
taking a very long time to stop they
are doing it piecemeal. You go into

602
00:18:38.577 --> 00:18:39.702
are doing it piecemeal. You go into
the Department for Transport and one

603
00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.911
the Department for Transport and one
person deals with that franchise,

604
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:43.452
person deals with that franchise,
one person deals with that one, and

605
00:18:43.452 --> 00:18:44.827
one person deals with that one, and
none of them ever talk to each

606
00:18:44.827 --> 00:18:47.244
none of them ever talk to each
other, none of them can do anything

607
00:18:47.244 --> 00:18:48.577
other, none of them ran do anything
for I did a project

608
00:18:48.577 --> 00:18:48.952
other, none of them can do anything
for I did a project once on

609
00:18:48.952 --> 00:18:50.369
for I did a project once on
ticketing, and trying to get a

610
00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:52.786
ticketing, and trying to get a
ticket that gets you to one place to

611
00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:53.952
ticket that gets you to one place to
another as cheap as possible, and

612
00:18:53.952 --> 00:18:56.786
another as cheap as possible, and
it’s virtually impossible. Yes, we

613
00:18:56.786 --> 00:18:59.577
it’s virtually impossible. Yes, we
need to do HSZ, we need to do far

614
00:18:59.577 --> 00:19:00.911
need to do HSZ, we need to do far
more in terms of infrastructure

615
00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:02.577
more in terms of infrastructure
development, because we are running

616
00:19:02.577 --> 00:19:02.827
development, because we are mnning
on

617
00:19:02.827 --> 00:19:03.827
development, because we are running
on Victorian lines at the moment,

618
00:19:03.827 --> 00:19:06.952
on Victorian lines at the moment,
and we need to expect more. Our

619
00:19:06.952 --> 00:19:08.744
and we need to expect more. Our
country, our transport system is a

620

country, our transport system is a
bit of an embarrassment, compared to

621
00:19:11.244 --> 00:19:12.119
bit of an embarrassment, compared to
other European countries, so we

622
00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:18.827
other European countries, so we
really need to step up and invest.

00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:19.369
really need to step up and invest.
who in

Who in the audience supports the

who in the audience supports the
building of

Who in the audience supports the
building of HS2? Yes, sir.

627

building of HS2? Yes, sir.
Absolutely, we need to start

628
00:19:26.577 --> 00:19:27.911
Absolutely, we need to start
increasing the connectivity to the

629
00:19:27.911 --> 00:19:29.536
increasing the connectivity to the
north, but the question which was

630
00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:31.452
north, but the question which was
asked earlier, which hasn’t been

631
00:19:31.452 --> 00:19:31.536
asked eartier, which hasn’t been
answered,

632
00:19:31.536 --> 00:19:32.619
asked earlier, which hasn’t been
answered, is the cost to the

633
00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:35.827
answered, is the cost to the
individual user. It’s a huge

634
00:19:35.827 --> 00:19:37.786
individual user. It’s a huge
disincentive to use the railways,

635
00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:40.327
disincentive to use the railways,
when it costs £250 for an open

636
00:19:40.327 --> 00:19:41.786
when it costs £250 for an open
return from Macclesfield to London,

a

00:19:41.994 --> 00:19:43.869
return from Macclesfield to London,
a scandalous amount of money for the

639
00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:44.536
a scandalous amount of money for the
lady said eartier,

640
00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:45.369
a scandalous amount of money for the

This is the thing I can’t get my

This is the thing I can’t get my
head around, from a business point

652
00:20:05.202 --> 00:20:07.786
head around, from a business point
of view. Somebody in the department

has been paid a lot of money to set

has been paid a lot of money to set

they came up

out —— sit down and budget H52, and
they came up with 38 billion, then

659

there is a

with all respect to the people of

with all respect to the people of

704
00:21:36.411 --> 00:21:36.786
much broader basis? For farmers,
this has

705
00:21:36.786 --> 00:21:37.911
much broader basis? Forfarmers,
this has been absolutely huge. It’s

706
00:21:37.911 --> 00:21:40.911
this has been absolutely huge. It’s
been ongoing for ten years. We have

707
00:21:40.911 --> 00:21:42.536
been ongoing for ten years. We have
had land

708
00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:44.411
been ongoing for ten years. We have
had [and that has been compulsorily

709
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:44.702
had land that has been compulsorily
purchased,

710
00:21:44.702 --> 00:21:45.452
had [and that has been compulsorily
purchased, houses being compulsorily

711
00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:47.869
purchased, houses being compulsorily
purchased, and in many cases that

712
00:21:47.869 --> 00:21:48.911
purchased, and in many cases that
transaction has not been completed,

713
00:21:48.911 --> 00:21:50.827
transaction has not been completed,
those farmers have not been paid for

714
00:21:50.827 --> 00:21:51.661
those farmers have not been paid for
that, they have sacrificed

715
00:21:51.661 --> 00:21:54.411
that, they have sacrificed
businesses. I have had farmers with

716
00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:57.452
businesses. I have had farmers with
tears in their eyes who have had to

717
00:21:57.452 --> 00:21:57.744
tears in their eyes who have had to
dose

718
00:21:57.744 --> 00:22:00.119
tears in their eyes who have had to
close their farm shop, close all of

719
00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:00.827
close their farm shop, close all of
their diversification, wedding

720
00:22:00.827 --> 00:22:02.452
their diversification, wedding
businesses, and ten years and still

721
00:22:02.452 --> 00:22:03.661
businesses, and ten years and still
not knowing, so that’s been a

722
00:22:03.661 --> 00:22:06.744
not knowing, so that’s been a
massive issue. We have also, I

723
00:22:06.744 --> 00:22:07.911
massive issue. We have also, I
think, got to look at infrastructure

724
00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:08.119
think, got to look at infrastmclure
and

725
00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.952
think, got to look at infrastructure
and investment and where it goes.

726
00:22:09.952 --> 00:22:13.036
and investment and where it goes.
This is going through historic

727
00:22:13.036 --> 00:22:14.911
This is going through historic
ancient woodland that is

728
00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:15.827
ancient woodland that is
irreplaceable, and the damage to

729
00:22:15.827 --> 00:22:17.327
irreplaceable, and the damage to
nature and the environment on the

730
00:22:17.327 --> 00:22:18.744
nature and the environment on the
back of that doesn’t seem to be

731
00:22:18.744 --> 00:22:20.452
back of that doesn’t seem to be
talked about nearly enough. We will

732
00:22:20.452 --> 00:22:21.119
talked about nearty enough. We will
not replace it

733
00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:23.036
talked about nearly enough. We will
not replace it with like for like.

734
00:22:23.036 --> 00:22:24.411
not replace it with like for like.
We do the same with house—building,

00:22:24.411 --> 00:22:27.286
We do the same with house-building,
we don’t

736
00:22:27.286 --> 00:22:28.202
We do the same with house—building,
we don’t prioritise housing land for

737
00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:30.994
we don’t prioritise housing land for
where we will produce food, and

738
00:22:30.994 --> 00:22:33.119
where we will produce food, and
going forward, with climate change,

739
00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:35.411
going forward, with climate change,
we have to prioritise infrastructure

740
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:36.119
we have to prioritise infrastmclure
and talk

741
00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:36.702
we have to prioritise infrastructure
and talk about food production,

742
00:22:36.702 --> 00:22:38.411
and talk about food production,
about nature, and we have to be

743
00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:40.786
about nature, and we have to be
responsible across society. Do you

744
00:22:40.786 --> 00:22:44.827
responsible across society. Do you
think we should go ahead? Little of

745
00:22:44.827 --> 00:22:46.244
think we should go ahead? Little of
a return on the investment? 50 many

746
00:22:46.244 --> 00:22:49.036
a return on the investment? So many
people don’t

747
00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:50.036
a return on the investment? 50 many
people don’t know. —— will it

destroyed, the woodland it will
destroy, and what those farmers in

that part of the country feel, in
Warwickshire and Staffordshire, is

Warwickshire and Staffordshire, is
they need an ombudsman to represent

757
00:23:03.411 --> 00:23:05.161
they need an ombudsman to represent
them to make the case. It has been

758
00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:08.536
them to make the use. It has been
ten years. So you

759
00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:09.494
them to make the case. It has been
ten years. So you haven’t taken a

760
00:23:09.494 --> 00:23:11.411
ten years. So you haven’t taken a
view on this yet, in terms of

761
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:14.577
view on this yet, in terms of
representing farmers? We have taken

762
00:23:14.577 --> 00:23:16.494
representing farmers? We have taken
a view to represent farmers and make

763
00:23:16.494 --> 00:23:17.827
a view to represent farmers and make
sure their concerns are heard, but

sure their concerns are heard, but
nobody has no if it will happen or

not, and its destroyed lives in its

766
00:23:21.952 --> 00:23:23.827
not, and its destroyed lives in its
wake, so we have to look at

767
00:23:23.827 --> 00:23:25.369
wake, so we have to look at
infrastructure, where it will go, in

768

infrastmclure, where it will go, in
the whola

the whole round, and the point

infrastructure, where it will go, in
the whole round, and the pointJulie

771
00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:28.327
the whole round, and the point julie
makes is, is

772
00:23:28.327 --> 00:23:28.952
the whole round, and the pointJulie
makes is, is that investment not

makes is, is that investment not
betting to Northern Rail as a whole,

774
00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:34.744
betting to Northern Rail as a whole,
on a wider basis, rather than just

775
00:23:34.744 --> 00:23:40.827
on a wider basis, rather than just
HSZ, with all of the ramifications?

776
00:23:41.577 --> 00:23:42.952
HSZ, with all of the ramifications?
I get the feeling, and looking at

777
00:23:42.952 --> 00:23:43.869
I get the feeling, and looking at
your face is now,

778
00:23:43.869 --> 00:23:44.369
I get the feeling, and looking at
yourface is now, that we

779
00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:44.702
I get the feeling, and looking at
your face is now, that we could talk

780
00:23:44.702 --> 00:23:47.577
your face is now, that we could talk
about rail all night. Let’s not do

781
00:23:47.577 --> 00:23:49.411
about rail all night. Let’s not do
that, because you put lots of other

782
00:23:49.411 --> 00:23:49.619
that, because you put lots of other
questions in,

783
00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:51.369
that, because you put lots of other
questions in, so I’m going to move

784
00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:53.244
questions in, so I’m going to move
on but, before I do that, just to

say that next week we will be in

Hopkinton in Hertfordshire, and the

we will go back later. jennifer

00:24:17.869 --> 00:24:19.994
we will go back later. Jennifer
Murphy. Is it really safe to apply

anyone out of Wuhan back to the UK,

799
00:24:23.369 --> 00:24:23.577
anyone out of Wuhan back to the UK,
given

800
00:24:23.577 --> 00:24:23.786
anyone out of Wuhan hack to the UK,
given the

801
00:24:23.786 --> 00:24:24.327
anyone out of Wuhan back to the UK,
given the severity of the

802
00:24:24.327 --> 00:24:27.327
given the severity of the
coronavirus? Would you rather that

803
00:24:27.327 --> 00:24:31.202
coronavirus? Would you rather that
we left them there, honestly? Yes, I

804
00:24:31.202 --> 00:24:32.202
we left them there, honestly? Yes, I
think they should be quarantined

805
00:24:32.202 --> 00:24:35.577
think they should be quarantined
there. Even it is like a plague, it

806
00:24:35.577 --> 00:24:36.036
there. Even it is like a plague, it
seems, I

807
00:24:36.036 --> 00:24:36.286
there. Even it is like a plague, it
seems, Idon’t

808
00:24:36.286 --> 00:24:37.327
there. Even it is like a plague, it
seems, I don’t know the mortality

809
00:24:37.327 --> 00:24:38.911
seems, I don’t know the mortality
rate and whether it kills everybody

810
00:24:38.911 --> 00:24:40.536
rate and whether it kills everybody
who is affected, I don’t know, but I

811
00:24:40.536 --> 00:24:44.536
who is affected, I don’t know, but I
think they should stay there. It

812
00:24:44.536 --> 00:24:45.911
think they should stay there. It
isn’t killing everybody affected,

813
00:24:45.911 --> 00:24:47.202
isn’t killing everybody affected,
because thousands of people have

814
00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:49.494
because thousands of people have
been affected and over a hundred had

815
00:24:49.494 --> 00:24:50.536
been affected and over a hundred had
died, but it certainly hasn’t,

816
00:24:50.536 --> 00:24:51.702
died, but it certainly hasn’t,
otherwise there would be about 7000

817
00:24:51.702 --> 00:24:55.786
otherwise there would be about 7000
people dead. Geoff Norcott, leave

818
00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:59.827
people dead. Geoff Norcott, leave
them there? I was really hoping

819
00:24:59.827 --> 00:25:02.369
them there? I was really hoping
you’d come for me on this! It is one

820
00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:04.452
you’d come for me on this! It is one
of these things, these new stories

821
00:25:04.452 --> 00:25:08.744
of these things, these new stories
ticking over, so when I’m watching

822
00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:09.911
ticking over, so when I’m watching
Question Time, I often think, you

823
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:11.244
Question Time, I often think, you
don’t know what you are talking

824
00:25:11.244 --> 00:25:12.702
don’t know what you are talking
about, make, let somebody else have

825
00:25:12.702 --> 00:25:15.744
about, make, let somebody else have
a go, so I will keep brief... Good

826
00:25:15.744 --> 00:25:18.577
a go, so I will keep brief... Good
for you! Nobody has ever said that

827
00:25:18.577 --> 00:25:21.286
for you! Nobody has ever said that
on my time on Question Time! Do you

828
00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.786
on my time on Question Time! Do you
think we know what we are talking

829
00:25:22.786 --> 00:25:26.202
think we know what we are talking
about? Whereas this is an issue

830
00:25:26.202 --> 00:25:26.369
about? whereas this is an issue
where

831
00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:27.827
about? Whereas this is an issue
where China is historically

832
00:25:27.827 --> 00:25:29.744
where China is historically
sometimes a bit guarded in this

833
00:25:29.744 --> 00:25:31.952
sometimes a bit guarded in this
respect, they are being quite open,

834
00:25:31.952 --> 00:25:33.202
respect, they are being quite open,
and I think that’s constructive, but

835
00:25:33.202 --> 00:25:36.286
and I think that’s constructive, but
I will let the experts take over.

836
00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:37.202
I will let the experts take over.
You are looking quite exercised

837
00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:40.536
You are looking quite exercised
about it. I can’t quite understand

838
00:25:40.536 --> 00:25:41.994
about it. I can’t quite understand
what is going on because first of

839
00:25:41.994 --> 00:25:44.536
what is going on because first of
all we are told there will be self

840
00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:45.452
all we are told there will be self
isolation, secondly, we are told

841
00:25:45.452 --> 00:25:50.036
isolation, secondly, we are told
there is quarantine. Yes, they will

842
00:25:50.036 --> 00:25:51.869
there is quarantine. Yes, they will
be a hospital. Then we are told they

843
00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:53.077
be a hospital. Then we are told they
will be coming back by playing

844
00:25:53.077 --> 00:25:54.661
will be coming back by playing
together and go to a military

845
00:25:54.661 --> 00:25:55.661
together and go to a military
building, where they will be

846
00:25:55.661 --> 00:25:57.994
building, where they will be
together until there is no symptom

847
00:25:57.994 --> 00:26:01.619
together until there is no symptom
appearing, and so, also, what will

848
00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:03.327
appearing, and so, also, what will
happen in the aeroplane with the air

849
00:26:03.327 --> 00:26:05.661
happen in the aeroplane with the air
conditioning, with the 200 people

850
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:06.077
conditioning, with the 200 peopla
coming back

851
00:26:06.077 --> 00:26:07.327
conditioning, with the 200 people
coming back together? I am a bit

852
00:26:07.327 --> 00:26:08.286
coming back together? I am a bit
concerned about these people coming

853
00:26:08.286 --> 00:26:13.202
concerned about these people coming
back. In case one infected person

854
00:26:13.202 --> 00:26:13.619
back. In use one infected person
would

855
00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:14.369
back. In case one infected person
would infect everybody else? Yes,

856
00:26:14.369 --> 00:26:17.952
would infect everybody else? Yes,
infecting the whole plane. Since

857
00:26:17.952 --> 00:26:18.411
infecting the whole plane. Since
january,

858
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:20.244
infecting the whole plane. Since
January, there are 1500 that

859
00:26:20.244 --> 00:26:20.327
january, there are 1500 that
actually

860
00:26:20.327 --> 00:26:25.952
January, there are 1500 that
actually come back

861
00:26:26.327 --> 00:26:29.577
actually come back from China,
Wuhan, and only if you have been

862
00:26:29.577 --> 00:26:29.786
Wuhan, and only if you have been
trackabla,

863
00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:31.369
Wuhan, and only if you have been
trackable, apparently. So where are

864
00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:31.744
trackabla, apparently. So where are
these peopla,

865
00:26:31.744 --> 00:26:32.827
trackable, apparently. So where are
these people, and are the public at

866
00:26:32.827 --> 00:26:36.327
these people, and are the public at
risk? We haven’t had an outbreak

867
00:26:36.327 --> 00:26:40.994
risk? We haven’t had an outbreak
yet. Fergus Walsh was on television

868
00:26:40.994 --> 00:26:41.911
yet. Fergus Walsh was on telavision
saying it, and it

869
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:43.452
yet. Fergus Walsh was on television
saying it, and it was also in the

870
00:26:43.452 --> 00:26:45.744

papers about the amount, in the

871
00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:46.661
papers about the amount, in the
newspapers, in the Guardian and

Telegraph. Sacha Lord, should we be
flying people back? We have seen

00:26:53.827 --> 00:26:54.286
ﬂying people back? We have seen
lots of

876
00:26:54.286 --> 00:26:56.827
flying people back? We have seen
lots of people on the news desperate

877
00:26:56.827 --> 00:26:59.494
lots of people on the news desperate
to come home. On that, I am not

878
00:26:59.494 --> 00:27:01.327
to come home. On that, I am not
qualified to answer

879
00:27:01.327 --> 00:27:01.536
to come home. On that, I am not
qualified to answerJennifer’s

880
00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:01.869
qualified to answer jennifer’s
question,

881
00:27:01.869 --> 00:27:03.036
qualified to answerJennifer’s
question, but I did find out

qualified to answerJennifer’s
question, but I did find outlast

883
00:27:03.202 --> 00:27:03.827

week, a fact

884
00:27:03.827 --> 00:27:05.452
question, but I did find outlast
week, a fact I never knew, that

Wuhan is twinned with Manchester,

886
00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:12.661
Wuhan is twinned with Manchester,
which is a new one for me. I think

887
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:13.952
which is a new one for me. I think
the government did a really, really

888
00:27:13.952 --> 00:27:14.952
the government did a really, really
poor job,

889
00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:16.911
the government did a really, really
poorjob, actually, when the news

890
00:27:16.911 --> 00:27:17.411
poor job, actually, when the news
first broke,

891
00:27:17.411 --> 00:27:21.077
poorjob, actually, when the news
first broke, so there are 9 million

892
00:27:21.077 --> 00:27:22.327
first broke, so there are 9 million
peopla. To

893
00:27:22.327 --> 00:27:23.911
first broke, so there are 9 million
people. To give you an idea,

894
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:25.036
people. To give you an idea,
Manchester is 2.8 million, Scotland

895
00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:28.244
Manchester is 2.8 million, Scotland
is 5 million. Their advice was to

896
00:27:28.244 --> 00:27:31.452
is 5 million. Their advice was to
get out of the area. When it is

897
00:27:31.452 --> 00:27:31.661
get out of the area. when it is
under

898
00:27:31.661 --> 00:27:32.702
get out of the area. When it is
under lockdown and there is no

899
00:27:32.702 --> 00:27:32.869
under lockdown and there is no
pub“:

900
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:34.952
under lockdown and there is no
public transport and you can’t

901
00:27:34.952 --> 00:27:36.244
public transport and you can’t
drive, you have got people watching

902
00:27:36.244 --> 00:27:37.161
drive, you have got peopla watching
on the

903
00:27:37.161 --> 00:27:39.952
drive, you have got people watching
on the news, clinic and for their

904
00:27:39.952 --> 00:27:41.744
on the news, clinic and for their
lives, skying interview is over, how

905
00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:45.536
lives, skying interview is over, how
are you supposed to get out?!

906
00:27:45.536 --> 00:27:46.911
are you supposed to get out?!
Panicking for their lives. And I see

907
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:51.702
Panicking for their lives. And I see
today that there is a plane, people

908
00:27:51.702 --> 00:27:52.286
today that there is a plane, people
being ﬂown

909
00:27:52.286 --> 00:27:53.327
today that there is a plane, people
being flown back to the Wirral, but

910
00:27:53.327 --> 00:27:54.202
being ﬂown back to the “ﬁnal, but
I think it

911
00:27:54.202 --> 00:27:55.327
being flown back to the Wirral, but
I think it was too little, too late,

912
00:27:55.327 --> 00:27:58.536
I think it was too little, too late,
and we should have followed other

913
00:27:58.536 --> 00:28:00.744
and we should have followed other
countries’ examples. The woman in

914
00:28:00.744 --> 00:28:03.869
countries“ examples. The woman in
the glasses. I am

915
00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:04.911
countries’ examples. The woman in
the glasses. I am a local GP and,

916
00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:06.244
the glasses. I am a [oral GP and,
with regards to

917
00:28:06.244 --> 00:28:06.827
the glasses. I am a local GP and,
with regards to the coronavirus, I

918
00:28:06.827 --> 00:28:07.244
with regards to the coronavims, I
think the

919
00:28:07.244 --> 00:28:07.952
with regards to the coronavirus, I
think the government have done a

920
00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:09.702
think the government have done a
good job. I

921
00:28:09.702 --> 00:28:09.827
think the government have done a
goodjob. I have

922
00:28:09.827 --> 00:28:10.661
think the government have done a
good job. I have a brilliant amount

923
00:28:10.661 --> 00:28:12.202
good job. I have a brilliant amount
of information very quickly. I think

924
00:28:12.202 --> 00:28:14.744
of information very quickly. I think
the problem is the press, they are

925
00:28:14.744 --> 00:28:15.827
the problem is the press, they are
scaremongering, not giving the right

926
00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:15.869
scaremongering, not giving the right
information.

927
00:28:15.869 --> 00:28:18.411
information.
APPLAUSE

928
00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:22.952
APPLAUSE
Let’s have some of it now.

929
00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:26.036
Let’s have some of it now.
Hopefully, Fergus is doing a

930
00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:26.452
Hopefully, Fergus is doing a
reasonable job.

931
00:28:26.452 --> 00:28:26.911
Hopefully, Fergus is doing a
reasonablejob. What

932
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:27.702
Hopefully, Fergus is doing a
reasonable job. What about what the

933
00:28:27.702 --> 00:28:28.494
reasonabla job. what about what the
lady was

934
00:28:28.494 --> 00:28:29.077
reasonable job. What about what the
lady was saying there about

935
00:28:29.077 --> 00:28:30.702
lady was saying there about
everybody coming back on the plane,

936
00:28:30.702 --> 00:28:32.077
everybody coming back on the plane,
and will they end up infecting each

937
00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:37.411
and will they end up infecting each
other? It’s an incredibly contagious

938
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:39.411
other? It’s an incredibly contagious
form of the flu virus, essentially,

939
00:28:39.411 --> 00:28:39.786
form of the ﬂu virus, essentially,
and what

940
00:28:39.786 --> 00:28:40.702
form of the flu virus, essentially,
and what nobody ever talks about is

941
00:28:40.702 --> 00:28:41.952
and what nobody ever talks about is
the military staff and medical

942
00:28:41.952 --> 00:28:42.244
the military staff and medical
staff,

943
00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:42.452
the military staff and mediral
staff, they

944
00:28:42.452 --> 00:28:44.494
the military staff and medical
staff, they are likely to be

945
00:28:44.494 --> 00:28:45.827
staff, they are likely to be
carriers and are going to infect

946
00:28:45.827 --> 00:28:46.327
carriers and are going to infect
peopla, but

947
00:28:46.327 --> 00:28:50.702
carriers and are going to infect
people, but where do they go? Almost

948
00:28:50.702 --> 00:28:51.036
peopla, but where do they go? Almost
as many

949
00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:52.536
people, but where do they go? Almost
as many questions as answers. Sarah?

950
00:28:52.536 --> 00:28:54.452
as many questions as answers. Sarah?
150 peopla are

951
00:28:54.452 --> 00:28:56.619
as many questions as answers. Sarah?
150 people are flying back tonight.

952
00:28:56.619 --> 00:28:57.161
150 peopla are ﬂying back tonight.
Possibly, as

953
00:28:57.161 --> 00:28:58.202
150 people are flying back tonight.
Possibly, as we speak. Was this the

954
00:28:58.202 --> 00:29:01.536
Possibly, as we speak. Was this the
right move? I wouldn’t claim to be

955
00:29:01.536 --> 00:29:04.077
right move? I wouldn’t claim to be
an expert. I think the point about

956
00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:05.494
an expert. I think the point about
China doing the right thing this

957
00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:07.327
China doing the right thing this
time is right, they have been much

958
00:29:07.327 --> 00:29:08.661
time is right, they have been much
more open, and I think, you know,

959
00:29:08.661 --> 00:29:09.536
more open, and Ithink, you know,
I’m not making a

960
00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:11.786
more open, and I think, you know,
I’m not making a point about exit

961
00:29:11.786 --> 00:29:13.286
I’m not making a point about exit
but I’m just saying, when we leave,

962
00:29:13.286 --> 00:29:15.911
but I’m just saying, when we leave,
we need to make sure we have got

963
00:29:15.911 --> 00:29:16.994
we need to make sure we have got
those cross government, cross

964
00:29:16.994 --> 00:29:18.161
those cross government, cross
country working together, because

965
00:29:18.161 --> 00:29:22.036
country working together, because
actually this has no borders. I

966
00:29:22.036 --> 00:29:23.619
actually this has no borders. I
think there has been criticism of

967
00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:24.827
think there has been criticism of
the government in that they have

968
00:29:24.827 --> 00:29:26.494
the government in that they have
been a bit slower to act than other

969
00:29:26.494 --> 00:29:27.661
been a bit slower to act than other
countries. I think the information

970
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:30.494
countries. I think the information
that peopla

971
00:29:30.494 --> 00:29:31.786
countries. I think the information
that people have got has been, and

972
00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:34.202
that people have got has been, and
maybe it is the government’s full,

973
00:29:34.202 --> 00:29:35.827
maybe it is the government’s full,
maybe it’s the public health role to

974
00:29:35.827 --> 00:29:38.202
maybe it’s the public health role to
get that information out, but are

975
00:29:38.202 --> 00:29:38.702
get that information out, but are
peopla being

976
00:29:38.702 --> 00:29:39.702
get that information out, but are
people being screened or not? Are

977
00:29:39.702 --> 00:29:42.494
people being screened or not? Are
they being brought or not? We have

978
00:29:42.494 --> 00:29:44.202
they being brought or not? We have
heard interviews on the radio with

979
00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:45.702
heard interviews on the radio with
people in Wuhan who are trying to

980
00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:46.077
peopla in Wuhan who are trying to
come back,

981
00:29:46.077 --> 00:29:47.119
people in Wuhan who are trying to
come back, who feel they are on

982
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.536
come back, who feel they are on
their own and not getting the help

983
00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:51.244
their own and not getting the help
they need. Do you think it’s the

984
00:29:51.244 --> 00:29:53.952
they need. Do you think it’s the
right thing to bring them back? Of

985
00:29:53.952 --> 00:29:55.786
right thing to bring them back? Of
course, if we can, and I think

986
00:29:55.786 --> 00:29:56.119
course, if we ran, and I think
quarantine is

987
00:29:56.119 --> 00:29:57.119
course, if we can, and I think
quarantine is the sensible approach.

988
00:29:57.119 --> 00:29:59.744
quarantine is the sensible approach.
I would say that we do public—health

989
00:29:59.744 --> 00:30:00.786
I would say that we do public-health
really well in

990
00:30:00.786 --> 00:30:01.494
I would say that we do public—health
really well in this country, but

991
00:30:01.494 --> 00:30:03.077
really well in this country, but
there has been a huge cut to the

992
00:30:03.077 --> 00:30:05.827
there has been a huge cut to the
budgets, and our diplomatic service

993
00:30:05.827 --> 00:30:08.036
budgets, and our diplomatic service
is at a 20 year low in terms of

994
00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:10.077
is at a 20 year low in terms of
funding, so the embassy, in China

995
00:30:10.077 --> 00:30:14.077
funding, so the embassy, in China
they will be struggling, and we will

996
00:30:14.077 --> 00:30:15.494
they will be struggling, and we will
be struggling with our public health

997
00:30:15.494 --> 00:30:15.702
be stmggling with our public health
approach

998
00:30:15.702 --> 00:30:17.036
be struggling with our public health
approach because we don’t have the

999
00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:19.202
approach because we don’t have the
resources we once had but I think,

1000
00:30:19.202 --> 00:30:20.827
resources we once had but I think,
is a country, we tend to be quite

1001
00:30:20.827 --> 00:30:22.827
is a country, we tend to be quite
good at managing these crises, and

1002
00:30:22.827 --> 00:30:24.619
good at managing these crises, and
we all need to make sure we are not

1003
00:30:24.619 --> 00:30:26.036
we all need to make sure we are not
trying to scaremonger. A lot of

1004
00:30:26.036 --> 00:30:26.411
trying to sraremonger. A lot of
ﬂights have

1005
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:27.494
trying to scaremonger. A lot of
flights have now been cancelled

1006
00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:27.869
ﬂights have now been ancellad
coming in

1007
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:29.077
flights have now been cancelled
coming in and out of the whole of

1008
00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:29.702
coming in and out of the whola of
China.

1009
00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:31.452
coming in and out of the whole of
China. There are a lot of people in

1010
00:30:31.452 --> 00:30:33.536
China. There are a lot of people in
the whole of China that might need

1011
00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:35.536
the whole of China that might need
to come back and, if this escalates

1012
00:30:35.536 --> 00:30:37.077
to come back and, if this escalates
quickly, we need to know what is the

1013
00:30:37.077 --> 00:30:39.744
quickly, we need to know what is the
government plans to its just been

1014
00:30:39.744 --> 00:30:42.077
government plans to its just been
declared a global emergency by the

1015
00:30:42.077 --> 00:30:45.077
declared a global emergency by the
World Health Organisation tonight

1016
00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:46.494
World Health Organisation tonight
from an NFU perspective, I am not

1017
00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:46.827
from an NFU perspective, lam not
entirely sure

1018
00:30:46.827 --> 00:30:48.202
from an NFU perspective, I am not
entirely sure what your view on this

1019
00:30:48.202 --> 00:30:48.827
entirely sure what your view on this
would be, but

1020
00:30:48.827 --> 00:30:50.161
entirely sure what your view on this
would be, butJennifer’s point,

1021
00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:50.369
would be, butjennifer’s point,
don’t

1022
00:30:50.369 --> 00:30:52.494
would be, butJennifer’s point,
don’t think it is a good idea to fly

1023
00:30:52.494 --> 00:30:52.827
don’t think it is a good idea to ﬂy
peopla back,

1024
00:30:52.827 --> 00:30:53.702
don’t think it is a good idea to fly
people back, despite the pleading we

1025
00:30:53.702 --> 00:30:58.119
people back, despite the pleading we
have been hearing over the airwaves.

1026
00:30:58.119 --> 00:30:58.619
have been hearing over the airwaves.
jennifer, I

1027
00:30:58.619 --> 00:30:59.161
have been hearing over the airwaves.
Jennifer, I sympathise with that,

1028
00:30:59.161 --> 00:30:59.577
jennifer, I sympathise with that,
but I

1029
00:30:59.577 --> 00:31:01.744
Jennifer, I sympathise with that,
but I think if you or I were out

1030
00:31:01.744 --> 00:31:02.827
but I think if you or I were out
there we would probably be pretty

1031
00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:04.702
there we would probably be pretty
desperate to come back. You know,

1032
00:31:04.702 --> 00:31:06.786
desperate to come back. You know,
it’s a really complex virus, and it

1033
00:31:06.786 --> 00:31:09.827
it’s a really complex virus, and it
ran

1034
00:31:09.827 --> 00:31:10.286
it’s a really complex virus, and it
ranjump from

1035
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:10.494
it’s a really complex virus, and it
canjumpfrom animal

1036
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:10.702
it’s a really complex virus, and it
canjumpfrom animalto

1037
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:11.036
it’s a really complex virus, and it
canjump from animal to human, and

1038
00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:11.494
ranjump from animal to human, and
it shows

1039
00:31:11.494 --> 00:31:12.952
canjump from animal to human, and
it shows how different China is to

1040
00:31:12.952 --> 00:31:17.494
it shows how different China is to
hear. This was at a wet market in

1041
00:31:17.494 --> 00:31:18.869
hear. This was at a wet market in
Wuhan where they bring in live

1042
00:31:18.869 --> 00:31:21.702
Wuhan where they bring in live
animals, they have snakes, marmots

1043
00:31:21.702 --> 00:31:23.536
animals, they have snakes, marmots
and bats, and the feeling is that

1044
00:31:23.536 --> 00:31:23.869
and hats, and the feeling is that
this jumped

1045
00:31:23.869 --> 00:31:24.411
and bats, and the feeling is that
this jumped from a bat

1046
00:31:24.411 --> 00:31:26.077
and bats, and the feeling is that
this jumped from a bet to a domestic

1047
00:31:26.077 --> 00:31:27.494
this jumped from a hat to a domestic
animal, and that was how it was

1048
00:31:27.494 --> 00:31:28.911
animal, and that was how it was
passed on to humans. I think there

1049
00:31:28.911 --> 00:31:31.244
passed on to humans. I think there
are big lessons to be learnt in how

1050
00:31:31.244 --> 00:31:34.494
are big lessons to be learnt in how
these things are spread, how these

1051
00:31:34.494 --> 00:31:35.411
these things are spread, how these
vimses

1052
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:37.827
these things are spread, how these
viruses spread, how they mutate, and

1053
00:31:37.827 --> 00:31:38.702
vimses spread, how they mutate, and
it is a real

1054
00:31:38.702 --> 00:31:42.077
viruses spread, how they mutate, and
it is a real lesson, I guess, in the

1055
00:31:42.077 --> 00:31:42.202
it is a real lesson, I guess, in the
whola

1056
00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:43.036
it is a real lesson, I guess, in the
whole standards. China had that

1057
00:31:43.036 --> 00:31:45.619
whole standards. China had that
horrendous outbreak whereby they had

1058
00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:49.119
horrendous outbreak whereby they had
contaminated baby milk, and they put

1059
00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:50.494
contaminated baby milk, and they put
56,000 babies in hospital, and so

1060
00:31:50.494 --> 00:31:50.702
contaminated baby milk, and they put
56,000 babies in hospital, and sol

1061
00:31:50.702 --> 00:31:52.536
56,000 babies in hospital, and sol
think we have to learn from what has

1062
00:31:52.536 --> 00:31:55.411
think we have to learn from what has
happened, and I am sure the Chinese,

1063
00:31:55.411 --> 00:31:56.911
happened, and I am sure the Chinese,
they seem to have reacted really

1064
00:31:56.911 --> 00:31:58.494
they seem to have reacted really
quickly to this, but they will have

1065
00:31:58.494 --> 00:31:58.911
quickly to this, but they will have
big lassons

1066
00:31:58.911 --> 00:32:00.077
quickly to this, but they will have
big lessons to learn on the back of

1067
00:32:00.077 --> 00:32:02.286
big lassons to learn on the back of
this that, if you

1068
00:32:02.286 --> 00:32:03.119
big lessons to learn on the back of
this that, if you have live animals,

1069
00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:04.536
this that, if you have live animals,
wild animals coming into markets

1070
00:32:04.536 --> 00:32:06.161
wild animals coming into markets
where there is food being sold, this

1071
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:08.286
where there is food being sold, this
is how these things can jump,

1072
00:32:08.286 --> 00:32:08.536
where there is food being sold, this
is how these things canjump, and

1073
00:32:08.536 --> 00:32:08.619
is how these things ranjump, and
it’s

1074
00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:09.911
is how these things canjump, and
it’s enormously dangerous, and now

1075
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:11.327
it’s enormously dangerous, and now
we have a global situation on the

1076
00:32:11.327 --> 00:32:13.744
we have a global situation on the
back of it, potentially on the back

1077
00:32:13.744 --> 00:32:20.369
back of it, potentially on the back
of one bat. How can the UK and the

1078
00:32:20.369 --> 00:32:20.994
of one bat. How can the UK and the
international community pressurise

1079
00:32:20.994 --> 00:32:22.536
international community pressurise
China into closing down these wet

1080
00:32:22.536 --> 00:32:24.036
China into closing down these wet
markets that deal in endangered

1081
00:32:24.036 --> 00:32:28.077
markets that deal in endangered
species and create these zoonotic

1082
00:32:28.077 --> 00:32:28.244
species and create these zoonotic
vimses

1083
00:32:28.244 --> 00:32:29.577
species and create these zoonotic
viruses which jump species? How can

1084
00:32:29.577 --> 00:32:29.911
vimses which jump species? How ran
we pressurise

1085
00:32:29.911 --> 00:32:30.744
viruses which jump species? How can
we pressurise them to close them

1086
00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:35.827
we pressurise them to close them
down? We have had this one, Sars and

1087
00:32:35.827 --> 00:32:39.161
down? We have had this one, Sars and
avian ﬂu.

1088
00:32:39.161 --> 00:32:45.119
And the lady at the front? After the
people have been in quarantine for

1089
00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:46.369
people have been in quarantine for
two weeks, what happens if they

1090
00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:46.744
two weeks, what happens if they
taught the

1091
00:32:46.744 --> 00:32:48.702
two weeks, what happens if they
caught the virus while they were

1092
00:32:48.702 --> 00:32:49.077
taught the virus while they were
there,

1093
00:32:49.077 --> 00:32:50.327
caught the virus while they were
there, within the two weeks? Will

1094
00:32:50.327 --> 00:32:50.827
there, within the two weeks? will
they be

1095
00:32:50.827 --> 00:32:52.619
there, within the two weeks? Will
they be monitored after being in

1096
00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:56.494
they be monitored after being in
quarantine? James, I’m sure you have

1097
00:32:56.494 --> 00:32:57.244
quarantine? james, I’m sure you have
been

1098
00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:57.411
quarantine? James, I’m sure you have
been briefed

1099
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:57.619
quarantine? james, I’m sure you have
been briefed up

1100
00:32:57.619 --> 00:33:00.119
quarantine? James, I’m sure you have
been briefed up to the gills on this

1101
00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:02.952
been briefed up to the gills on this
subject as the flight has gone to

1102
00:33:02.952 --> 00:33:03.577
subject as the ﬂight has gone to
pick these

1103
00:33:03.577 --> 00:33:06.244
subject as the flight has gone to
pick these people up. 150 people are

1104
00:33:06.244 --> 00:33:07.119
pick these peopla up. 150 peopla are
coming back,

1105
00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:08.494
pick these people up. 150 people are
coming back, 50 from other EU

1106
00:33:08.494 --> 00:33:09.744
coming back, 50 from other EU
countries. They are going to this

1107
00:33:09.744 --> 00:33:11.702
countries. They are going to this
place in the Wirral where they will

1108
00:33:11.702 --> 00:33:14.036
place in the wirral where they will
stay for two

1109
00:33:14.036 --> 00:33:14.827
place in the Wirral where they will
stay for two weeks and then what?

1110
00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:17.869
stay for two weeks and then what?
Firstly, the simple answer to your

1111
00:33:17.869 --> 00:33:19.244
Firstly, the simple answer to your
question, Jennifer, is it is

1112
00:33:19.244 --> 00:33:19.452
question, jennifer, is it is
absolutely

1113
00:33:19.452 --> 00:33:20.452
question, Jennifer, is it is
absolutely right to bring these

1114
00:33:20.452 --> 00:33:21.452
absolutely right to bring these
people home. We have a

1115
00:33:21.452 --> 00:33:22.786
people home. We have a
responsibility and we are making

1116
00:33:22.786 --> 00:33:25.119
responsibility and we are making
good on that. We are lucky in the UK

1117
00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:27.119
good on that. We are lucky in the UK
that we have some genuine

1118
00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:27.952
that we have some genuine
world—class experts in disease

1119
00:33:27.952 --> 00:33:35.994
world—class experts in disease
management. And when these things

1120
00:33:35.994 --> 00:33:38.619
management. And when these things
happen, the people involved in the

1121
00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:40.744
happen, the people involved in the
days have done exercises, they have

1122
00:33:40.744 --> 00:33:41.536
days have done exercises, they have
practised their procedures, they

1123
00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:45.327
practised their procedures, they
have practised... The GP, I didn’t

1124
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:47.994
have practised... The GP, I didn’t
catch your name, I apologise, is

1125
00:33:47.994 --> 00:33:50.577
catch your name, Iapologise, is
right. We

1126
00:33:50.577 --> 00:33:51.411
catch your name, I apologise, is
right. We disseminate information to

1127
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:52.869
right. We disseminate information to
medical practitioners so they know

1128
00:33:52.869 --> 00:33:55.161
medical practitioners so they know
what to expect, they know the

1129
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:59.411
what to expect, they know the
parameters and the isolation that we

1130
00:33:59.411 --> 00:34:00.702
parameters and the isolation that we
are putting people into will be

1131
00:34:00.702 --> 00:34:00.952
are putting peopla into will be
designed

1132
00:34:00.952 --> 00:34:02.327
are putting people into will be
designed specifically to make sure

1133
00:34:02.327 --> 00:34:07.452
designed specifically to make sure
that before people are allowed back

1134
00:34:07.452 --> 00:34:11.244
that before people are allowed back
into wider community, they are no

1135
00:34:11.244 --> 00:34:13.994
into wider community, they are no
longer a medical risk. These things

1136
00:34:13.994 --> 00:34:14.827
longer a medical risk. These things
are done incredibly professionally

1137
00:34:14.827 --> 00:34:16.994
are done incredibly professionally
and as I say, we should as a country

1138
00:34:16.994 --> 00:34:19.161
and as I say, we should as a country
he very proud that we have got some

1139
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:21.536
be very proud that we have got some
very experienced practitioners in

1140
00:34:21.536 --> 00:34:29.119
very experienced practitioners in
this and we have

1141
00:34:30.827 --> 00:34:34.744
this and we have exercised ten Pipe,
my mother is from Syria, we had a

1142
00:34:34.744 --> 00:34:37.161
my mother is from Syria, we had a
fantastic response to the Ebola

1143
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:38.619
fantastic response to the Ebola
vims.

1144
00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:39.577
fantastic response to the Ebola
virus. This is incredibly scary, I

1145
00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:40.744
virus. This is incredibly scary, I
understand that and it is of

1146
00:34:40.744 --> 00:34:42.952
understand that and it is of
legitimate people are worried but we

1147
00:34:42.952 --> 00:34:44.619
legitimate people are worried but we
are global experts in dealing with

1148
00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:46.452
are global experts in dealing with
this kind of thing. The fact the

1149
00:34:46.452 --> 00:34:49.119
this kind of thing. The fact the
Chinese have been very open, that

1150
00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.994
Chinese have been very open, that
they have communicated with the

1151
00:34:50.994 --> 00:34:51.827
they have communicated with the
international community, that they

1152
00:34:51.827 --> 00:34:52.952
international community, that they
are sharing information I think it’s

1153
00:34:52.952 --> 00:34:55.452
are sharing information I think it’s
to their credit and has helped the

1154
00:34:55.452 --> 00:34:57.494
to their credit and has helped the
global medical community deal with

1155
00:34:57.494 --> 00:34:59.577
global medical community deal with
what is a very, very concerning

1156
00:34:59.577 --> 00:35:02.119
what is a very, very concerning
situation. What can we all expect to

1157
00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:03.577
situation. what ran we all expect to
happen now?

1158
00:35:03.577 --> 00:35:05.161
situation. What can we all expect to
happen now? Coronavirus in every

1159
00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:06.119
happen now? Coronavims in every
region in China,

1160
00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.119
happen now? Coronavirus in every
region in China, declared a global

1161
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.994
region in China, declared a global
emergency by the World Health

1162
00:35:08.994 --> 00:35:10.744
emergency by the World Health
Organization which bring certain

1163
00:35:10.744 --> 00:35:12.077
Organization which bring certain
procedures, such as for example

1164
00:35:12.077 --> 00:35:15.911
procedures, such as for example
stopping all flights to China,

1165
00:35:15.911 --> 00:35:17.369
stopping all flights to China,
extraordinary though that may sound.

1166
00:35:17.369 --> 00:35:17.577
extraordinary though that may sound.
What

1167
00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:17.786
extraordinary though that may sound.
what ran

1168
00:35:17.786 --> 00:35:21.369
extraordinary though that may sound.
What can we expect to follow now? I

1169
00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:22.119
what ran we expect to follow now? I
am not going to

1170
00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.744
What can we expect to follow now? I
am not going to speculate. I think

1171
00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:25.036
am not going to speculate. I think
we all agree on the panel, I don’t

1172
00:35:25.036 --> 00:35:26.952
we all agree on the panel, I don’t
pretend to know enough about the

1173
00:35:26.952 --> 00:35:30.619
pretend to know enough about the
procedures. But in terms of

1174
00:35:30.619 --> 00:35:32.202
procedures. But in terms of
government policy? I’m not going to

1175
00:35:32.202 --> 00:35:33.536
government policy? I’m not going to
speculate. This is one of those

1176
00:35:33.536 --> 00:35:36.661
speculate. This is one of those
areas where we do have experts,

1177
00:35:36.661 --> 00:35:38.244
areas where we do have experts,
medical experts, who are experienced

1178
00:35:38.244 --> 00:35:41.911
medical experts, who are experienced
and practised. They have done

1179
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:42.994
and practised. They have done
training exercises around this kind

1180
00:35:42.994 --> 00:35:47.286
training exercises around this kind
of thing. We will rely on those

1181
00:35:47.286 --> 00:35:50.286
of thing. We will rely on those
experts to use the experience that

1182
00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:51.911
experts to use the experience that
therve got to

1183
00:35:51.911 --> 00:35:52.536
experts to use the experience that
they’ve got to guide government

1184
00:35:52.536 --> 00:35:52.911
therve got to guide government
policy and

1185
00:35:52.911 --> 00:35:53.827
they’ve got to guide government
policy and our reaction. But the

1186
00:35:53.827 --> 00:35:55.994
policy and our reaction. But the
point I would say is the headlines

1187
00:35:55.994 --> 00:35:57.452
point I would say is the headlines
around these things can be

1188
00:35:57.452 --> 00:35:59.952
around these things ran be
incredibly

1189
00:35:59.952 --> 00:36:01.244
around these things can be
incredibly disconcerting but we are,

1190
00:36:01.244 --> 00:36:03.327
incredibly disconcerting but we are,
as I say, amongst the best in the

1191
00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:04.452
as I say, amongst the best in the
world with dealing with these

1192
00:36:04.452 --> 00:36:08.619
world with dealing with these
things. 0K. There is another subject

1193
00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:11.619
things. 0K. There is another subject
we had a lot of questions about this

1194
00:36:11.619 --> 00:36:13.452
we had a lot of questions about this
evening because, of course, tonight

1230
00:37:25.786 --> 00:37:30.411
Mahdi? I am with Geoff! In a weird
way, the Remainers are in the best

1231
00:37:30.411 --> 00:37:32.827
way, the Remainers are in the best
position to throw a party, they have

1232
00:37:32.827 --> 00:37:37.036
position to throw a party, they have
the food, the drugs, stockpile is!

1233
00:37:37.036 --> 00:37:39.494
the food, the drugs, stockpile is!
We get the idea. Listen, it’s

1234
00:37:39.494 --> 00:37:41.036
We get the idea. Listen, it’s
interesting now, it feels oddly

1235
00:37:41.036 --> 00:37:43.786
interesting now, it feels oddly
chilled out. In a strange way. It

1236
00:37:43.786 --> 00:37:43.952
chillad out. In a strange way. It
almost

1237
00:37:43.952 --> 00:37:45.411
chilled out. In a strange way. It
almost feels like you remember the

1238
00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:46.577
almost feels like you remember the
film the Truman show when it

1239
00:37:46.577 --> 00:37:46.786
film the Tmman show when it
finished

1240
00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:47.994
film the Truman show when it
finished and everyone started

1241
00:37:47.994 --> 00:37:49.369
finished and everyone started
watching something else? I’m glad we

1242
00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:50.952
watching something else? I’m glad we
are at that point because there has

1243
00:37:50.952 --> 00:37:52.661
are at that point because there has
been so much rancour over the point

1244
00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:54.286
been so much rancour over the point
and I think the vast majority of

1245
00:37:54.286 --> 00:37:54.786
and I think the vast majority of
peopla lean

1246
00:37:54.786 --> 00:37:56.077
and I think the vast majority of
people lean one way or the other and

1247
00:37:56.077 --> 00:37:57.702
people lean one way or the other and
weirdly at this point I’m thinking

1248
00:37:57.702 --> 00:37:59.119
weirdly at this point I’m thinking
back to a referendum day because we

1249
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.827
back to a referendum day because we
have all got lost in other arguments

1250
00:38:00.827 --> 00:38:01.494
have all got lost in other arguments
we may be

1251
00:38:01.494 --> 00:38:02.452
have all got lost in other arguments
we may he were not thinking about at

1252
00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:04.077
we may he were not thinking about at
the time. I didn’t go there with any

1253
00:38:04.077 --> 00:38:06.702
the time. I didn’t go there with any
ill will in my heart. I went there

1254
00:38:06.702 --> 00:38:08.661
ill will in my heart. I went there
and I wasn’t thinking about Empire.

1255
00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:11.661
and I wasn’t thinking about Empire.
I wasn’t feeling anything

1256
00:38:11.661 --> 00:38:12.661
I wasn’t feeling anything
xenophobic. I definitely wasn’t

1257
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:13.911
xenophobic. I definitely wasn’t
thinking about blue passports but

1258
00:38:13.911 --> 00:38:15.744
thinking about blue passports but
they are the best colour for a

1259
00:38:15.744 --> 00:38:18.286
they are the best colour for a
passport, but that is another issue!

1260
00:38:18.286 --> 00:38:20.994
passport, but that is another issue!
I was offered the chance for Britain

1261
00:38:20.994 --> 00:38:22.911
I was offered the chance for Britain
to end the political relationship

1262
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:24.202
to end the political relationship
that had changed drastically since

1263
00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:24.994
that had changed drastically since
we

1264
00:38:24.994 --> 00:38:25.202
that had changed drastically since
wejoined

1265
00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:25.786
that had changed drastically since
we joined the EU

1266
00:38:25.786 --> 00:38:26.827
that had changed drastically since
wejoined the EU and I took it. I

1267
00:38:26.827 --> 00:38:29.036
wejoined the EU and I took it. I
think it’s going to be OK. I know

1268
00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:29.411
think it’s going to be OK. I know
peopla might

1269
00:38:29.411 --> 00:38:32.994
think it’s going to be OK. I know
people might scoff at that sort of

1270
00:38:32.994 --> 00:38:33.202
peopla might scoff at that sort of
optimism

1271
00:38:33.202 --> 00:38:34.161
people might scoff at that sort of
optimism but consumer confidence,

1272
00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:35.452
optimism but consumer confidence,
business morale are genuine things.

1273
00:38:35.452 --> 00:38:37.827
business morale are genuine things.
I will go on record, this will

1274
00:38:37.827 --> 00:38:39.411
I will go on record, this will
probably be the thing that bites and

1275
00:38:39.411 --> 00:38:41.577
probably be the thing that bites and
on the backside but I think the

1276
00:38:41.577 --> 00:38:42.911
on the backside but I think the
economy will really motor this year.

1277
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:45.577
economy will really motor this year.
I think the jobs market will remain

1278
00:38:45.577 --> 00:38:48.161
I think the jobs market will remain
buoyant, I think England will win

1279
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:53.619
buoyant, I think England will win
Euro 2020. Steady on! Make no

1280
00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:54.369
Euro 2020. Steady on! Make no
apologies for being optimistic.

1281
00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:55.161
apologies for being optimistic.
APPLAUSE

1282
00:38:55.161 --> 00:39:01.661
APPLAUSE
Right, Sarah? Is this a moment of

1283
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.077
Right, Sarah? Is this a moment of
celebration or if nothing else,

1284
00:39:03.077 --> 00:39:03.244
celabration or if nothing else,
coming

1285
00:39:03.244 --> 00:39:05.036
celebration or if nothing else,
coming together? I have

1286
00:39:05.036 --> 00:39:07.036
coming together? I have
nine—year—old twin boys and they

1287
00:39:07.036 --> 00:39:07.452
nine-year-old twin boys and they
have five

1288
00:39:07.452 --> 00:39:08.369
nine—year—old twin boys and they
have five football mates coming for

1289
00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:09.161
have five football mates coming for
a shepover

1290
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:10.202
have five football mates coming for
a sleepover tomorrow night so

1291
00:39:10.202 --> 00:39:10.577
have five football mates coming for
a sleepover tomorrow night sol

1292
00:39:10.577 --> 00:39:11.119
have five football mates coming for
a sleepover tomorrow night so I will

1293
00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:11.827
a shepover tomorrow night so I will
spend that

1294
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:12.619
a sleepover tomorrow night so I will
spend that night locked in my

1295
00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:14.827
spend that night locked in my
bedroom drinking a glass of wine,

1296
00:39:14.827 --> 00:39:16.452
bedroom drinking a glass of wine,
with seven boys running about the

1297
00:39:16.452 --> 00:39:17.619
with seven boys mnning about the
house!

1298
00:39:17.619 --> 00:39:18.827
with seven boys running about the
house! But it is really important

1299
00:39:18.827 --> 00:39:20.119
house! But it is really important
moment and I think we need to

1300
00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:25.536
moment and I think we need to
recognise both sides of this Brexit

1301
00:39:25.536 --> 00:39:28.952
recognise both sides of this Brexit
debate. For many people, being part

1302
00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:30.119
debate. For many people, being part
of the European Union meant

1303
00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:32.119
of the European Union meant
something very important to them. It

1304
00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:34.036
something very important to them. It
meant something about partnership,

1305
00:39:34.036 --> 00:39:35.161
meant something about partnership,
something about progress, something

1306
00:39:35.161 --> 00:39:36.827
something about progress, something
about having that voice that meant

1307
00:39:36.827 --> 00:39:39.202
about having that voice that meant
we could say no to those big global

1308
00:39:39.202 --> 00:39:41.161
we could say no to those big global
powers if we needed to because we

1309
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:42.411
powers if we needed to because we
stood together. We need to recognise

1310
00:39:42.411 --> 00:39:44.619
stood together. We need to recognise
that, that is what I also felt about

1311
00:39:44.619 --> 00:39:46.744
that, that is what I also felt about
being in the European Union. But

1312
00:39:46.744 --> 00:39:48.077
being in the European Union. But
there was always that gap where

1313
00:39:48.077 --> 00:39:49.452
there was always that gap where
there were people that didn’t feel

1314
00:39:49.452 --> 00:39:51.077
there were people that didn’t feel
that way and they didn’t believe

1315
00:39:51.077 --> 00:39:52.786
that way and they didn’t believe
that that was what European Union

1316
00:39:52.786 --> 00:39:54.411
that that was what European Union
was so here we are and we are

1317
00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:56.119
was so here we are and we are
leaving. Whilst I won’t be

1318
00:39:56.119 --> 00:39:58.536
leaving. Whilst I won’t be
celebrating, I think that both

1319
00:39:58.536 --> 00:40:00.202
celebrating, I think that both
sides, you know, Leavers felt they

1320
00:40:00.202 --> 00:40:02.661
sides, you know, Leavers felt they
didn’t recognise their country any

1321
00:40:02.661 --> 00:40:04.161
didn’t recognise their country any
more and Remainers now are thinking,

1322
00:40:04.161 --> 00:40:06.952
more and Remainers now are thinking,
I want to salvage what I love from

1323
00:40:06.952 --> 00:40:09.161
I want to salvage what I love from
my country. We all want our country

1324
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:11.619
my country. We all want our country
back, right? That’s where we are. We

1325
00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:12.452
back, right? That’s where we are. We
want to move

1326
00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:12.702
back, right? That’s where we are. We
wa nt to move forward.

1327
00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:13.786
back, right? That’s where we are. We
want to move forward. I think the

1328
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:13.911
want to move forward. I think the
“Y

1329
00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.452
want to move forward. I think the
way I would disagree with what you

1330
00:40:15.452 --> 00:40:17.119
way I would disagree with what you
were saying is there’s a lot more

1331
00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:19.786
were saying is there’s a lot more
that we need to pick here. We have

1332
00:40:19.786 --> 00:40:21.077
that we need to pick here. We have
no idea what our immigration

1333
00:40:21.077 --> 00:40:22.827
no idea what our immigration
strategy will become a government is

1334
00:40:22.827 --> 00:40:28.036
strategy will become a government is
tying itself in knots already about

1335
00:40:28.036 --> 00:40:28.994
tying itself in knots already about
trade relationships. We don’t know

1336
00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:30.619
trade relationships. We don’t know
what kind of deal we are going to

1337
00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:30.786
what kind of deal we are going to
get

1338
00:40:30.786 --> 00:40:31.036
what kind of deal we are going to
set by

1339
00:40:31.036 --> 00:40:32.369
what kind of deal we are going to
get by the end of the year, it is

1340
00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:33.869
get by the end of the year, it is
probably going to be a very small

1341
00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:35.286
probably going to be a very small
one. We’re probably not going to fix

1342
00:40:35.286 --> 00:40:37.119
one. We’re probably not going to fix
the services, we have the problem

1343
00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:38.202
the services, we have the problem
with Northern Ireland actually, the

1344
00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:39.452
with Northern Ireland actually, the
economy has already taken a beating

1345
00:40:39.452 --> 00:40:41.619
economy has already taken a beating
over the last few years, there are

1346
00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:44.286
over the last few years, there are
problems here. But I think, Boris

1347
00:40:44.286 --> 00:40:44.369
problams here. But I think, Boris
johnson

1348
00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:44.661
prohlams here. But I think, Boris
johnson might

1349
00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:46.786
problems here. But I think, Boris
Johnson might have been the man to

1350
00:40:46.786 --> 00:40:47.202
johnson might have been the man to
kind of

1351
00:40:47.202 --> 00:40:48.411
Johnson might have been the man to
kind of win the Brexit war but I

1352
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:50.119
kind of win the Brexit war but I
don’t know if he is the man to bring

1353
00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:51.827
don’t know if he is the man to bring
the peace, do you know what I mean?

1354
00:40:51.827 --> 00:40:53.411
the peace, do you know what I mean?
He is not necessarily the man who is

1355
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.286
He is not necessarily the man who is
going to put in the hard graft to

1356
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.619
going to put in the hard graft to
get this done, not necessarily the

1357
00:40:56.619 --> 00:40:58.286
get this done, not necessarily the
man who wants to bring people

1358
00:40:58.286 --> 00:40:58.786
man who wants to bring peopla
together.

1359
00:40:58.786 --> 00:41:00.452
man who wants to bring people
together. He has never talked about

1360
00:41:00.452 --> 00:41:02.536
together. He has never talked about
levelling up the country until he

1361
00:41:02.536 --> 00:41:05.202
levelling up the country until he
won some seats in the north of the

1362
00:41:05.202 --> 00:41:07.244
won some seats in the north of the
country and I worry about that. I

1363
00:41:07.244 --> 00:41:10.661
country and I worry about that. I
think that is why he won their

1364
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:12.369
think that is why he won their
seats. I share your optimism about

1365
00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.536
seats. I share your optimism about
our country because I love our

1366
00:41:13.536 --> 00:41:14.911
our country because I love our
country and we are all brilliant but

1367
00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:16.786
country and we are all brilliant but
this is the moment when we need to

1368
00:41:16.786 --> 00:41:18.161
this is the moment when we need to
come together. The woman at the back

1369
00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:22.369
come together. The woman at the back
with the dark hair? I was a

1370
00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:22.952
with the dark hair? I was a
Remainer, I voted

1371
00:41:22.952 --> 00:41:23.744
with the dark hair? I was a
Remainer, Ivoted Remain. I

1372
00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:23.994
with the dark hair? I was a
Remainer, Ivoted Remain. lam

1373
00:41:23.994 --> 00:41:25.786
Remainer, Ivoted Remain. lam
hugely relieved the decision has

1374
00:41:25.786 --> 00:41:28.077
hugely relieved the decision has
been made and we are moving forward.

1375
00:41:28.077 --> 00:41:30.119
been made and we are moving forward.
I think it has given an incredible

1376
00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:31.369
I think it has given an incredible
sign for business and confidence has

1377
00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:33.994
sign for business and confidence has
been boosted and I hope we will have

1378
00:41:33.994 --> 00:41:35.619
been boosted and I hope we will have
an incredibly prosperous year as a

1379
00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:37.827
an incredibly prosperous year as a
result. What will you be doing

1380
00:41:37.827 --> 00:41:40.452
result. What will you be doing

about... This has been democratic,
we are leaving, the Prime Minister

1417
00:42:43.036 --> 00:42:44.494
we are leaving, the Prime Minister
has a really strong mandate now

1418
00:42:44.494 --> 00:42:45.911

which is good because it concludes

Brexit right and for as that is all
about trade. For each and every one

about the food you will be eating,

1430
00:43:04.827 --> 00:43:08.286
about the food you will be eating,
about maintaining our standards of

00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:08.661
about maintaining our standards of
animal welfare,

1432
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:09.661
about maintaining our standards of
animalwelfare, maintaining our

1433
00:43:09.661 --> 00:43:09.869
animal welfare, maintaining our

animalwelfare, maintaining our
standards of environmental

1435
00:43:10.327 --> 00:43:11.952
standards of environmental
protection. We have to get Brexit

1436
00:43:11.952 --> 00:43:13.536
protection. We have to get Brexit
right was that we have a

1437
00:43:13.536 --> 00:43:15.244
right was that we have a
once—in—a—lifetime chance to design

1438
00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:16.327
once-in-a-lifetime chance to design
our own

1439
00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:18.952
once—in—a—lifetime chance to design
our own trade policy, our own. The

1440
00:43:18.952 --> 00:43:20.619
our own trade policy, our own. The
responsibility of that lies with

1441
00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:21.661
responsibility of that lies with
this government. Huge pressure on

1442
00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:23.869
this government. Huge pressure on
them but I do think we need to work

1443
00:43:23.869 --> 00:43:25.661
them but I do think we need to work
in partnership, we need to shape it

1444
00:43:25.661 --> 00:43:28.161
in partnership, we need to shape it
and we need to be really clear about

1445
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:29.327
and we need to be really clear about
what we want. I will

1446
00:43:29.327 --> 00:43:29.869
and we need to be really clear about
what we want. I willjust say, it’s

1447
00:43:29.869 --> 00:43:31.077
what we want. I will just say, it’s
very

1448
00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:32.536
what we want. I willjust say, it’s
very interesting that the voice of

1449
00:43:32.536 --> 00:43:35.327
very interesting that the voice of
consumers has said standards must be

1450
00:43:35.327 --> 00:43:38.119
consumers has said standards must be
maintained no matter what. Price is

1451
00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:40.577
maintained no matter what. Price is
important, choice is important,

1452
00:43:40.577 --> 00:43:43.369
important, choice is important,
consumer rights is important but

1453
00:43:43.369 --> 00:43:44.952
consumer rights is important but
nothing, nothing at the expense of

1454
00:43:44.952 --> 00:43:47.411
nothing, nothing at the expense of
standards. They go on to say that

1455
00:43:47.411 --> 00:43:49.702
standards. They go on to say that
70% of consumers really have no idea

1456
00:43:49.702 --> 00:43:50.036
7096 of consumers really have no idea
about

1457
00:43:50.036 --> 00:43:51.577
70% of consumers really have no idea
about trade policy, have no idea

1458
00:43:51.577 --> 00:43:54.202
about trade policy, have no idea
about how this will impact on the

1459
00:43:54.202 --> 00:43:55.036
about how this will impact on the
food in our

1460
00:43:55.036 --> 00:43:56.494
about how this will impact on the
food in ourfridges. So there is

1461
00:43:56.494 --> 00:43:56.952
food in our fridges. So there is
huge

1462
00:43:56.952 --> 00:43:57.827
food in ourfridges. So there is
huge responsibility on us to

1463
00:43:57.827 --> 00:43:59.077
huge responsibility on us to
challenge government to work with

1464
00:43:59.077 --> 00:44:01.244
challenge government to work with
government, to make sure this isn’t

1465
00:44:01.244 --> 00:44:03.994

about getting Brexit done but

1466
00:44:03.994 --> 00:44:05.119
about getting Brexit done but
getting Brexit right. Brexit is

1467
00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:06.577
getting Brexit right. Brexit is
done, we are leaving, let’s make

you planning some huge rave tomorrow

1473
00:44:17.452 --> 00:44:19.952
you planning some huge rave tomorrow
night? I

1474
00:44:19.952 --> 00:44:20.619
you planning some huge rave tomorrow
night? Ithink it is

1475
00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:21.411
you planning some huge rave tomorrow
night? I think it is going to be a

1476
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:25.411
night? I think it is going to be a
very muted... We are entering this

1477
00:44:25.411 --> 00:44:27.411
very muted... We are entering this
transition period. The student there

1478
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:29.369
transition period. The student there
that mention 12 months. I don’t

1479
00:44:29.369 --> 00:44:31.036
that mention 12 months. I don’t
think the transition period will be

1480
00:44:31.036 --> 00:44:32.994
think the transition period will be
finished in 12 months, I really

1481
00:44:32.994 --> 00:44:35.161
finished in 12 months, I really
don’t. Tomorrow will bring on—site

1482
00:44:35.161 --> 00:44:35.494
don’t. Tomorrow will bring on-site
relief for

1483
00:44:35.494 --> 00:44:36.702
don’t. Tomorrow will bring on—site
relief for me. The three and a half

1484
00:44:36.702 --> 00:44:39.411
relief for me. The three and a half
years we have had this cloud over us

1485
00:44:39.411 --> 00:44:41.619
years we have had this cloud over us
of negativity, of hatred. I think we

1486
00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:43.661
of negativity, of hatred. I think we
have actually lost sight on local

1487
00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:45.411
have actually lost sight on local
matters that really do matter. For

1488
00:44:45.411 --> 00:44:47.702
matters that really do matter. For
example, across the whole of the UK,

1489
00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:49.494
example, across the whole of the UK,
there is a big homelessness issue.

1490
00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:50.952
there is a big homelessness issue.
We are very lucky in Greater

1491
00:44:50.952 --> 00:44:54.119
We are very lucky in Greater
Manchester that the every night

1492
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:55.536
Manchester that the every night
campaign, we have seen a reduction

1493
00:44:55.536 --> 00:44:59.369
campaign, we have seen a reduction
in homelessness. But we need to look

1494
00:44:59.369 --> 00:45:01.786
in homelessness. But we need to look
at that, look at the NHS, we have a

1495
00:45:01.786 --> 00:45:03.577
at that, look at the NHS, we have a
problem with knife crime. I think

1496
00:45:03.577 --> 00:45:05.786
problem with knife crime. I think
once this is out of the way

1497
00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:07.202
once this is out of the way
tomorrow, we can concentrate on

1498
00:45:07.202 --> 00:45:07.786
tomorrow, we ran concentrate on
issues

1499
00:45:07.786 --> 00:45:08.869
tomorrow, we can concentrate on
issues that really matter locally.

1500
00:45:08.869 --> 00:45:11.786
issues that really matter locally.
I’m quite relieved about it.

1501
00:45:11.786 --> 00:45:13.369
I’m quite relieved about it.

00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:31.327
next 12 months, there is so much
uncertainty. Likewise in the NHS,

1515
00:45:31.327 --> 00:45:34.202
uncertainty. Likewise in the NHS,
there is so much uncertainty. I’m

1516
00:45:34.202 --> 00:45:36.077
there is so much uncertainty. I’m
watching it with interest at what

1517
00:45:36.077 --> 00:45:37.994
watching it with interest at what
will happen, but for me, it’s going

1518
00:45:37.994 --> 00:45:41.661
will happen, but for me, it’s going
to create slight beliefs. So,

1519
00:45:41.661 --> 00:45:42.161
will happen, but for me, it’s going
to create slight beliefs. 50, James.

alcohol. Doesn’t sound much like a

1534

1535
00:46:06.702 --> 00:46:10.619
to me! No party I would want to go
to. On that basis, are you trying to

1536
00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:13.036
to. On that basis, are you trying to
not celebrate too much tomorrow? Are

1537
00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:15.161
not celebrate too much tomorrow? Are
you trying to ride two horses? And

1538
00:46:15.161 --> 00:46:16.494
you trying to ride two horses? And
how to train for the government in

1539
00:46:16.494 --> 00:46:18.161
how to train for the government in
that sense but you don’t want to

1540
00:46:18.161 --> 00:46:20.327
that sense but you don’t want to
look triumphalist. You had serious

1541
00:46:20.327 --> 00:46:21.369
look triumphalist. You had serious
questions from the student for

1542
00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:25.494
questions from the student for
exampla?

1543
00:46:25.494 --> 00:46:27.952
What I would say is, if you want to

1544
00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:28.202
what I would say is, if you want to
celebrate

1545
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:29.036
What I would say is, if you want to
celebrate tomorrow night, then do

00:46:29.036 --> 00:46:31.577

00:46:38.036 --> 00:46:41.827

big thing about this is that a

1556
00:46:41.827 --> 00:46:43.244
big thing about this is that a
question was asked, and it was a

1557
00:46:43.244 --> 00:46:44.911
question was asked, and it was a
question that had been rumbling

1558
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:45.369
question that had been mmbling
along below

1559
00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:47.161
question that had been rumbling
along below the surface for a very

1560
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:48.619
along below the surface for a very
long time, and it needed to be

1561
00:46:48.619 --> 00:46:51.411
long time, and it needed to be
resolved. The question was asked,

1562
00:46:51.411 --> 00:46:53.911
resolved. The question was asked,
the country answered, everyone

1563
00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.702
the country answered, everyone
promised that they would abide by

1564
00:46:55.702 --> 00:46:57.536
promised that they would abide by
the decision and it turned out that

1565
00:46:57.536 --> 00:46:58.494
the decision and it turned out that
only the Conservative Party meant

1566
00:46:58.494 --> 00:47:01.786
only the Conservative Party meant
it. We ended up having a general

1567
00:47:01.786 --> 00:47:05.327

election, in large part on this

1568
00:47:05.327 --> 00:47:06.494
election, in large part on this
issue, and the question was answered

1569
00:47:06.494 --> 00:47:09.202
issue, and the question was answered
for a second time, which is why

1570
00:47:09.202 --> 00:47:10.452
for a second time, which is why
tomorrow night we are leaving the

need the EU to make us fat. We are a

of being in the EU. what about
protecting

1603
00:48:21.702 --> 00:48:24.952
of being in the EU. What about
protecting standards? We have some

1604

protecting standards? We have some

standards in the world, that is not

going to change. But we are talking

going to change. But we are talking
about our standards, and we always

about our standards, and we always
said we wanted to maintain our

The point I’m making is that, now

1642
00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:38.952
The point I’m making is that, now
that the British government is fully

1643
00:49:38.952 --> 00:49:39.952
that the British government is fully
responsible to the British public

1644
00:49:39.952 --> 00:49:41.869
responsible to the British public
for things like trade policy on

respond to the desires of the

1647
00:49:46.536 --> 00:49:49.369
respond to the desires of the
British people, and there is no

1648
00:49:49.369 --> 00:49:51.702
British people, and there is no
desire to scrap our animal welfare

1649
00:49:51.702 --> 00:49:51.952
desire to scrap our animal welfare
standards, our

00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:58.202
standards. why didn’t you put it in
the bill?

1654
00:49:58.202 --> 00:49:59.202
standards. Why didn’t you put it in
the bill? The British people do not

1655

want it to

1656
00:49:59.827 --> 00:50:01.161
the bill? The British people do not
want it to happen and therefore it

1657
00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:02.161
want it to happen and therefore it
will not happen, because this

1658
00:50:02.161 --> 00:50:03.827
will not happen, because this
government will respond to the needs

1659
00:50:03.827 --> 00:50:05.911
government will respond to the needs
and the wants of the British people,

1660
00:50:05.911 --> 00:50:06.286
and the wants of the British peopla,
and that

1661
00:50:06.286 --> 00:50:07.202
and the wants of the British people,
and that is how a democracy should

1662
00:50:07.202 --> 00:50:09.202
and that is how a democracy should
work. That is what Brexit is all

1663
00:50:09.202 --> 00:50:13.661
work. That is what Brexit is all
about. So, if people want something,

1664
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:14.411
about. So, if peopla want something,
you don’t put it

1665
00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.202
about. So, if people want something,
you don’t put it in law? I am

you don’t put it in law? I am

1685
00:50:52.827 --> 00:50:54.161
think you need to legislate it. I
thinkJames is right, it needs to be

1686
00:50:54.161 --> 00:50:54.411
think james is right, it needs to be
consumer

1687
00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:55.786
thinkJames is right, it needs to be
consumer led and, with education, I

1688
00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:57.869
consumer lad and, with education, I
don’t think

1689
00:50:57.869 --> 00:50:58.286
consumer led and, with education, I
don’t think this audience

1690
00:50:58.286 --> 00:51:00.827
don’t think this audience
particularly needs educating, we all

1691
00:51:00.827 --> 00:51:01.286
particularty needs educating, we all
live in

1692
00:51:01.286 --> 00:51:02.411
particularly needs educating, we all
live in the Peak District and we see

1693
00:51:02.411 --> 00:51:05.036
live in the Peak District and we see
the animals we eat, food welfare,

1694
00:51:05.036 --> 00:51:08.244
the animals we eat, food welfare,
nobody is going to go around Tesco

1695
00:51:08.244 --> 00:51:09.411
nobody is going to go around Tesco
and read the agricultural policy and

1696
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:11.619
and read the agricultural policy and
look to see what is in legislation

1697
00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:11.786
look to see what is in lagislation
and

1698
00:51:11.786 --> 00:51:13.411
look to see what is in legislation
and what is not, what they need to

1699
00:51:13.411 --> 00:51:14.536
and what is not, what they need to
see is things that are clearly

1700
00:51:14.536 --> 00:51:14.994
see is things that are clearly
labelled, not

1701
00:51:14.994 --> 00:51:18.036
see is things that are clearly
labelled, notjust with the welfare

1702
00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:18.494
labelled, not just with the welfare
issue, on

1703
00:51:18.494 --> 00:51:19.786
labelled, notjust with the welfare
issue, on the front cover of a steak

1704
00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:21.869
issue, on the front cover of a steak
I would love to see where it has

1705
00:51:21.869 --> 00:51:23.161
I would love to see where it has
come from, I want to see how

1706
00:51:23.161 --> 00:51:25.494
come from, I want to see how
environmental that farmer has been,

1707
00:51:25.494 --> 00:51:27.702
environmental that farmer has been,
I want the scoring for that and its

1708
00:51:27.702 --> 00:51:28.952
I want the scoring for that and its
welfare, and I want to see the

1709
00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:31.119
welfare, and I want to see the
traceability of it, to see exactly

1710
00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:33.994
traceability of it, to see exactly
what sort of animal it is. It sounds

1711
00:51:33.994 --> 00:51:38.036
what sort of animal it is. It sounds
like you have experience? I am a

1712
00:51:38.036 --> 00:51:40.577
like you have experience? I am a
farmer. I’d like to see cows graded

1713
00:51:40.577 --> 00:51:42.036
farmer. I’d like to see cows graded
in a green way, so a

1714
00:51:42.036 --> 00:51:42.744
farmer. I’d like to see cows graded
in a green way, so 3 Harry Hill cow

1715
00:51:42.744 --> 00:51:43.536
in a green way, so a Harry Hill cow
that is living on

1716
00:51:43.536 --> 00:51:44.161
in a green way, so 3 Harry Hill cow
that is living on the more

1717
00:51:44.161 --> 00:51:44.619
in a green way, so a Harry Hill cow
that is living on the more that is

1718
00:51:44.619 --> 00:51:46.702
that is living on the more that is
promoting bird and insect health, I

1719
00:51:46.702 --> 00:51:48.119
promoting bird and insect health, I
would like to see that steak being

1720
00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:53.786
would like to see that steak being
branded as a green hairy cow, as

1721
00:51:53.786 --> 00:51:56.327
branded as a green hairy cow, as
opposed to a mass produced, factory

1722
00:51:56.327 --> 00:51:57.536
opposed to a mass produced, factory
produced animal, and the same for

1723
00:51:57.536 --> 00:52:01.369
produced animal, and the same for
chicken. Who here would stand up and

1724
00:52:01.369 --> 00:52:01.994
chicken. who here would stand up and
say, yes, I

1725
00:52:01.994 --> 00:52:02.202
chicken. who here would stand up and
say, yes, lam

1726
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:02.786
chicken. Who here would stand up and
say, yes, I am going to eat

1727
00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:03.952
say, yes, I am going to eat
chlorinated chicken from the US?

1728
00:52:03.952 --> 00:52:09.536
chlorinated chicken from the US?
They are not. Is chlorinated chicken

1729
00:52:09.536 --> 00:52:10.869
They are not. Is chlorinated chicken
definitely not something we are ever

1730
00:52:10.869 --> 00:52:14.577
definitely not something we are ever
going to see in this country as a

1731
00:52:14.577 --> 00:52:19.244
going to see in this country as a
result of a deal with the US? And

1732
00:52:19.244 --> 00:52:19.911
result of a deal with the US? And
Michael Gove was Environment

1733
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:21.369
Michael Gove was Environment
Secretary, he said that isn’t on the

1734
00:52:21.369 --> 00:52:24.494
Secretary, he said that isn’t on the
table, it’s not what we are going to

1735
00:52:24.494 --> 00:52:29.494
table, it’s not what we are going to
do

1736
00:52:29.952 --> 00:52:32.661
do the American Secretary of State
will try and negotiate the best deal

1737
00:52:32.661 --> 00:52:32.952
will try and negotiate the best deal
he ran

1738
00:52:32.952 --> 00:52:34.161
will try and negotiate the best deal
he can for the Americans and, you

1739
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:34.827
he ran for the Americans and, you
know what, if

1740
00:52:34.827 --> 00:52:35.619
he can for the Americans and, you
know what, if there are things we

1741
00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:37.202
know what, if there are things we
don’t want in that deal, we will say

1742
00:52:37.202 --> 00:52:41.161
don’t want in that deal, we will say
so. So we are not having chlorinated

1743
00:52:41.161 --> 00:52:44.661
so. So we are not having chlorinated
chicken? Of course not! Hands up who

1744
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.911
chicken? Of course not! Hands up who
fancies chlorinated chicken? Why

1745
00:52:46.911 --> 00:52:47.119
fancies chlorinated chicken? why
would

1746
00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:48.827
fancies chlorinated chicken? Why
would we want to import a load of it

1747
00:52:48.827 --> 00:52:51.202
would we want to import a load of it
when nobody would eat it? We haven’t

1748
00:52:51.202 --> 00:52:54.452
when nobody would eat it? We haven’t
got much more time to one more

1749
00:52:54.452 --> 00:52:57.786
got much more time to one more
question from Catherine Whelpton.

1750
00:52:57.786 --> 00:52:58.327
question from Catherine whelpton.
The average

1751
00:52:58.327 --> 00:53:00.536
question from Catherine Whelpton.
The average age of owning a mobile

1752
00:53:00.536 --> 00:53:01.827
The average age of owning a mobile
phone is becoming younger. Should we

1753
00:53:01.827 --> 00:53:05.411
phone is becoming younger. Should we
be concerned? I assume you are

1754
00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:06.536
be concerned? I assume you are
talking about a report which came

1755
00:53:06.536 --> 00:53:09.411
talking about a report which came
out today saying that more than half

1756
00:53:09.411 --> 00:53:12.161
out today saying that more than half
of children, just more than half of

1757
00:53:12.161 --> 00:53:16.452
of children, just more than half of
children, own a mobile by age seven.

1758
00:53:16.452 --> 00:53:19.327
children, own a mobile by age seven.
Sacha Lord, should we be concerned?

1759
00:53:19.327 --> 00:53:20.994
Sacha Lord, should we be concerned?
I don’t think it’s the mobile phone

1760
00:53:20.994 --> 00:53:23.327
I don’t think it’s the mobile phone
in itself we should be concerned

1761
00:53:23.327 --> 00:53:25.036
in itself we should be concerned
about, it is perhaps the apps, the

1762
00:53:25.036 --> 00:53:28.494
about, it is perhaps the apps, the
social media. Everybody is now all

1763
00:53:28.494 --> 00:53:31.452
social media. Everybody is now all
about Instagram, Twitter, and I

1764
00:53:31.452 --> 00:53:33.744
about Instagram, Twitter, and I
don’t know if you have that thing on

1765
00:53:33.744 --> 00:53:35.327
don’t know if you have that thing on
your phone which tells you how many

1766
00:53:35.327 --> 00:53:37.161
your phone which tells you how many
hours you spent on it in a week,

1767
00:53:37.161 --> 00:53:39.202
hours you spent on it in a week,
when that pops up it’s scary, and I

1768
00:53:39.202 --> 00:53:40.619
when that pops up it’s scary, and I
think more so than the phone should

1769
00:53:40.619 --> 00:53:44.786
think more so than the phone should
concerned about that. I’ve got a son

1770
00:53:44.786 --> 00:53:47.036
concerned about that. I’ve got a son
that is coming up to four years old

1771
00:53:47.036 --> 00:53:49.161
that is coming up to four years old
and, if he ever sees this, he is not

1772
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:50.827
and, if he ever sees this, he is not
getting a mobile phone by the age of

1773
00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:52.786
getting a mobile phone by the age of
seven! He will probably have a

1774
00:53:52.786 --> 00:53:53.786
seven! He will probably have a
driving licence before having a

1775
00:53:53.786 --> 00:53:57.994
driving licence before having a
mobile phone. As a parent, good luck

1776
00:53:57.994 --> 00:53:59.786
mobile phone. As a parent, good luck
with that! But the four—year—old,

1777
00:53:59.786 --> 00:54:00.244
with that! But the four-year-old,
but the driving

1778
00:54:00.244 --> 00:54:03.161
with that! But the four—year—old,
but the driving licence bid. I don’t

1779
00:54:03.161 --> 00:54:04.702
but the driving licence bid. I don’t
understand why a seven—year—old

1780
00:54:04.702 --> 00:54:05.036
understand why a seven-year-old
needs a

1781
00:54:05.036 --> 00:54:06.077
understand why a seven—year—old
needs a mobile phone, and we all

1782
00:54:06.077 --> 00:54:08.369
needs a mobile phone, and we all
know we are addicted to them, we

1783
00:54:08.369 --> 00:54:09.619
know we are addicted to them, we
know the potential damage, and one

1784
00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:11.369
know the potential damage, and one
of the jobs as a parent is to say

1785
00:54:11.369 --> 00:54:13.744
of the jobs as a parent is to say
no. I remember, if

1786
00:54:13.744 --> 00:54:14.119
of the jobs as a parent is to say
no. I remember, ifI

1787
00:54:14.119 --> 00:54:15.077
of the jobs as a parent is to say
no. I remember, if I said to my mum,

1788
00:54:15.077 --> 00:54:16.161
no. I remember, if I said to my mum,
everybody else is doing it, she

1789
00:54:16.161 --> 00:54:19.827
everybody else is doing it, she
would give me a predictable answer,

1790
00:54:19.827 --> 00:54:19.994
would give me a predictable answer,
berause

1791
00:54:19.994 --> 00:54:20.952
would give me a predictable answer,
because it isn’t necessarily an end

1792
00:54:20.952 --> 00:54:24.077
because it isn’t necessarily an end
in itself it is rare that I am

1793
00:54:24.077 --> 00:54:25.286
in itself it is rare that I am
shocked by statistics, but over half

1794
00:54:25.286 --> 00:54:25.744
shocked by statistic, but over half
of kids

1795
00:54:25.744 --> 00:54:27.577
shocked by statistics, but over half
of kids have got a mobile phone by

1796
00:54:27.577 --> 00:54:29.036
of kids have got a mobile phone by
age seven, I think people have to

1797
00:54:29.036 --> 00:54:31.911
age seven, I think people have to
stand their ground. The woman in the

1798
00:54:31.911 --> 00:54:36.702
stand their ground. The woman in the
red top. Is a teacher, we use mobile

1799
00:54:36.702 --> 00:54:41.994
red top. Is a teacher, we use mobile
phones in schools and in colleges to

1800
00:54:41.994 --> 00:54:43.202
phones in schools and in colleges to
help the students to find vocabulary

1801
00:54:43.202 --> 00:54:44.786
help the students to find vocabulary
to research things and be able to

1802
00:54:44.786 --> 00:54:47.244
to research things and be able to
find things and, as you said, it’s

1803
00:54:47.244 --> 00:54:48.577
find things and, as you said, it’s
about being able to use technology

1804
00:54:48.577 --> 00:54:50.244
about being able to use technology
in the way forward. I am pretty sure

1805
00:54:50.244 --> 00:54:52.744
in the way forward. I am pretty sure
that most parents properly give a

1806
00:54:52.744 --> 00:54:53.077
that most parents property give a
phone to

1807
00:54:53.077 --> 00:54:53.869
that most parents properly give a
phone to their young children at

1808
00:54:53.869 --> 00:54:56.577
phone to their young children at
some point, may be to keep them

1809
00:54:56.577 --> 00:54:58.161
some point, may be to keep them
busy, may be to keep them safe if

1810
00:54:58.161 --> 00:55:00.952
busy, may be to keep them safe if
they are walking home from somewhere

1811
00:55:00.952 --> 00:55:02.494
they are walking home from somewhere
for the first time, but it’s about

1812
00:55:02.494 --> 00:55:04.536
for the first time, but it’s about
the safety of that child from other

1813
00:55:04.536 --> 00:55:05.869
the safety of that child from other
people and the element of keeping up

1814
00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:09.452
people and the element of keeping up
with the Joneses for my friend has

1815
00:55:09.452 --> 00:55:09.702
people and the element of keeping up
with theJoneses for my friend has a

1816
00:55:09.702 --> 00:55:09.827
with the joneses for my friend has a
phone,

1817
00:55:09.827 --> 00:55:10.827
with theJoneses for my friend has a
phone, everybody has one, I want

1818
00:55:10.827 --> 00:55:13.702
phone, everybody has one, I want
one. Driving that down so much

1819
00:55:13.702 --> 00:55:14.911
one. Driving that down so much
lower, it will make a massive

1820
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.244
lower, it will make a massive
impact. You have children going for

1821
00:55:16.244 --> 00:55:20.661
impact. You have children going for
meals at age two and three, sat at a

1822
00:55:20.661 --> 00:55:21.869
meals at age two and three, sat at a
table, parents give their phone to

1823
00:55:21.869 --> 00:55:22.994
table, parents give their phone to
keep them occupied rather than

1824
00:55:22.994 --> 00:55:28.411
keep them occupied rather than
engaging in conversation.

1825
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:33.952
engaging in conversation. Have your
two nine—year—olds got mobiles?

1826
00:55:33.952 --> 00:55:35.494
two nine-year-olds got mobilas?
know. My

1827
00:55:35.494 --> 00:55:36.369
two nine—year—olds got mobiles?
know. My ten—year—old is top your

1828
00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:36.911
know. My ten-year-old is top your
primary, and she

1829
00:55:36.911 --> 00:55:38.161
know. My ten—year—old is top your
primary, and she brought me back a

1830
00:55:38.161 --> 00:55:39.827
primary, and she brought me back a
list of all the people in her class

1831
00:55:39.827 --> 00:55:40.161
list of all the peopla in her class
who had

1832
00:55:40.161 --> 00:55:42.119
list of all the people in her class
who had mobile phones she did her

1833
00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:45.577
who had mobile phones she did her
research, and about 95% of people

1834
00:55:45.577 --> 00:55:45.911
research, and about 9596 of peopla
had a

1835
00:55:45.911 --> 00:55:46.202
research, and about 9596 of people
had a phone,

1836
00:55:46.202 --> 00:55:47.452
research, and about 95% of people
had a phone, and the school allow

1837
00:55:47.452 --> 00:55:49.619
had a phone, and the school allow
you to take your phone in top year

1838
00:55:49.619 --> 00:55:51.327
you to take your phone in top year
primary, so the school is telling

1839
00:55:51.327 --> 00:55:52.994
primary, so the school is telling
you it’s OK, you’ve got all the

1840
00:55:52.994 --> 00:55:54.411
you it’s OK, you’ve got all the
other kids, so she got one for

1841
00:55:54.411 --> 00:55:56.619
other kids, so she got one for
Christmas. There are a few issues,

1842
00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.994
Christmas. There are a few issues,
and one is that there is a huge

1843
00:55:58.994 --> 00:55:59.869
and one is that there is a huge
social anxiety associated with

1844
00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:02.577
social anxiety associated with
having social media all the time,

1845
00:56:02.577 --> 00:56:04.161
having social media all the time,
and you’ve got to watch that, you

1846
00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:06.161
and you’ve got to watch that, you
can’t let them have these phones in

1847
00:56:06.161 --> 00:56:07.536
can’t let them have these phones in
their bedroom, you can’t let them

1848
00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:09.911
their bedroom, you can’t let them
look at them all the time because,

1849
00:56:09.911 --> 00:56:11.702
look at them all the time because,
if somebody hasn’t replied, there is

1850
00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:13.161
if somebody hasn’t replied, there is
an anxiety, and the second thing is

1851
00:56:13.161 --> 00:56:14.827
an anxiety, and the second thing is
you have to make sure that kids know

1852
00:56:14.827 --> 00:56:17.286
you have to make sure that kids know
what the dangers are. We can’t

1853
00:56:17.286 --> 00:56:18.661
what the dangers are. We can’t
assume that we can keep them safe

1854
00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:19.494
assume that we ran keep them safe
from

1855
00:56:19.494 --> 00:56:20.661
assume that we can keep them safe
from everything, and part of what we

1856
00:56:20.661 --> 00:56:23.452
from everything, and part of what we
need to be doing is teaching them

1857
00:56:23.452 --> 00:56:24.577
need to be doing is teaching them
where the risks are, what they

1858
00:56:24.577 --> 00:56:26.286
where the risks are, what they
should look out for how they should

1859
00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:29.327
should look out for how they should
themselves online. The third thing

1860
00:56:29.327 --> 00:56:31.369
themselves online. The third thing
is that social media companies need

1861
00:56:31.369 --> 00:56:31.702
is that social media companies need
to take

1862
00:56:31.702 --> 00:56:31.911
is that social media companies need
hhha

1863
00:56:31.911 --> 00:56:32.786
is that social media companies need
to take a lot more responsive lady

1864
00:56:32.786 --> 00:56:34.369
to take a lot more responsive lady
for what is on their platforms, and

1865
00:56:34.369 --> 00:56:35.827
for what is on their platforms, and
the government need to tell it

1866
00:56:35.827 --> 00:56:36.911
the government need to tell it
legislate for this, because there

1867
00:56:36.911 --> 00:56:38.286
legislate for this, because there
are some really nasty stuff out

1868
00:56:38.286 --> 00:56:39.827
are some really nasty stuff out
there and we can’t protect our kids

1869
00:56:39.827 --> 00:56:43.369
there and we can’t protect our kids
all the time as a young person, I

1870
00:56:43.369 --> 00:56:46.036
all the time as a young person, I
had a phone from age 11, mainly for

1871
00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:47.702
had a phone from age 11, mainly for
safety but also because I wanted to

1872
00:56:47.702 --> 00:56:50.411
safety but also because I wanted to
communicate with my friends, and for

1873
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:52.202
communicate with my friends, and for
a lot of children that is the way it

1874
00:56:52.202 --> 00:56:57.411
a lot of children that is the way it
is. Mainly for children as well, it

1875
00:56:57.411 --> 00:56:58.702
is. Mainly for children as well, it
sounds weird, but they are more

1876
00:56:58.702 --> 00:56:59.952
sounds weird, but they are more
aware of the dangers facing them

1877
00:56:59.952 --> 00:57:01.494
aware of the dangers facing them
than people now. I knew what I was

1878
00:57:01.494 --> 00:57:02.119
than peopla now. I knew what I was
facing when I

1879
00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:04.244
than people now. I knew what I was
facing when I was about 13, 14, and

1880
00:57:04.244 --> 00:57:06.452
facing when I was about 13, 14, and
I wasn’t going to

1881
00:57:06.452 --> 00:57:07.452
facing when I was about 13, 1A, and
I wasn’t going to go texting

1882
00:57:07.452 --> 00:57:08.869
I wasn’t going to go texting
30—year—old men or people who looked

1883
00:57:08.869 --> 00:57:10.702
30-year-old men or people who looked
creepy, you know

1884
00:57:10.702 --> 00:57:11.452
30—year—old men or people who looked
creepy, you know what you are doing.

1885
00:57:11.452 --> 00:57:13.036
creepy, you know what you are doing.
It isn’t as cut and dried as people

1886
00:57:13.036 --> 00:57:17.036
It isn’t as cut and dried as peopla
think it is. I

1887
00:57:17.036 --> 00:57:17.494
It isn’t as cut and dried as people
think it is. Ithink

1888
00:57:17.494 --> 00:57:18.952
It isn’t as cut and dried as people
think it is. I think that point is

1889
00:57:18.952 --> 00:57:20.036
think it is. I think that point is
really relevant, I think young

1890
00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:21.952
really relevant, I think young
people now are so savvy, and I think

1891
00:57:21.952 --> 00:57:22.494
peopla now are so savvy, and I think
education

1892
00:57:22.494 --> 00:57:25.452
people now are so savvy, and I think
education on social media is

1893
00:57:25.452 --> 00:57:26.827
education on social media is
transformed to what it was even a

1894
00:57:26.827 --> 00:57:30.619
transformed to what it was even a
few years ago. I think seven is far

1895
00:57:30.619 --> 00:57:32.702
few years ago. I think seven is far
too young. I held off with my

1896
00:57:32.702 --> 00:57:34.202
too young. I held off with my
children until they were using

1897
00:57:34.202 --> 00:57:34.494
children until they were using
pub“:

1898
00:57:34.494 --> 00:57:35.494
children until they were using
public transport, and then I let

1899
00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:37.202
public transport, and then I let
them have a phone. I look forward to

1900
00:57:37.202 --> 00:57:41.286
them have a phone. I look forward to
meeting Geoff ‘s 17—year—old son

1901
00:57:41.286 --> 00:57:41.744
meeting Geoff ‘s 17-year-old son
without a

1902
00:57:41.744 --> 00:57:42.827
meeting Geoff ‘s 17—year—old son
without a phone! I don’t think it

1903
00:57:42.827 --> 00:57:44.827
without a phone! I don’t think it
will happen. Obviously a lot of

1904
00:57:44.827 --> 00:57:47.536
will happen. Obviously a lot of
parents are managing, not forever,

1905
00:57:47.536 --> 00:57:50.161
parents are managing, not forever,
but I think seven is very young. I

1906
00:57:50.161 --> 00:57:52.577
but I think seven is very young. I
agree, absolutely, and we want to be

1907
00:57:52.577 --> 00:57:54.661
agree, absolutely, and we want to be
in contact with our children, to be

1908
00:57:54.661 --> 00:57:56.702
in contact with our children, to be
able to know that our children can

1909
00:57:56.702 --> 00:57:58.494
able to know that our children can
contact us, and I think 11 is a fair

1910
00:57:58.494 --> 00:58:02.994
contact us, and I think 11 is a fair
age. You look keen to talk with your

1911
00:58:02.994 --> 00:58:04.869
age. You look keen to talk with your
hand up. I

1912
00:58:04.869 --> 00:58:05.161
age. You look keen to talk with your
hand up. Iwould

1913
00:58:05.161 --> 00:58:05.827
age. You look keen to talk with your
hand up. I would class a mobile

1914
00:58:05.827 --> 00:58:11.286
hand up. I would class a mobile
phone for a youngster as a drug, and

1915
00:58:11.286 --> 00:58:12.869
phone for a youngster as a drug, and
I don’t really think we understand

1916
00:58:12.869 --> 00:58:13.286
I don’t really think we understand
that dmgs

1917
00:58:13.286 --> 00:58:14.952
I don’t really think we understand
that drugs take different forms.

1918
00:58:14.952 --> 00:58:15.494
that drugs take different forms.
It’s not just

1919
00:58:15.494 --> 00:58:17.536
that drugs take different forms.
It’s notjust about drugs in

1920
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:20.661
It’s notjust about drugs in
nightclubs... So

1921
00:58:20.661 --> 00:58:20.827
It’s notjust about drugs in
nightclubs... 50 mobile

1922
00:58:20.827 --> 00:58:21.452
It’s notjust about drugs in
nightclubs... So mobile phone use is

1923
00:58:21.452 --> 00:58:22.036
nightclubs... So mobile phone use is
a kind of

1924
00:58:22.036 --> 00:58:26.161
nightclubs... 50 mobile phone use is
a kind of addiction? It’s an

1925
00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:27.369
a kind of addiction? It’s an
addiction, it develops dependency

1926
00:58:27.369 --> 00:58:29.452
addiction, it develops dependency
and I’ve seen it in my great

1927
00:58:29.452 --> 00:58:30.786
and I’ve seen it in my great
nephews. They get this equipment,

1928
00:58:30.786 --> 00:58:32.744
nephews. They get this equipment,
they get it in front of their faces,

1929
00:58:32.744 --> 00:58:34.869
they get it in front of their faces,
and they learn the culture of

1930
00:58:34.869 --> 00:58:36.661
and they learn the culture of
meeting it from the moment they wake

1931
00:58:36.661 --> 00:58:36.869
meeting it from the moment they wake
“P

meeting it from the moment they wake

that’s going to develop dependency

1939
00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:55.994
that’s going to develop dependency
in later life? James, briefly, are

1940
00:58:55.994 --> 00:58:58.452
in later life? james, brieﬂy, are
you concerned

1941
00:58:58.452 --> 00:58:59.452
in later life? James, briefly, are
you concerned about the decreasing

1942
00:58:59.452 --> 00:59:02.702
you concerned about the decreasing
age at which kids are using mobile

1943
00:59:02.702 --> 00:59:04.702
age at which kids are using mobile
phones? I didn’t see the report, but

1944
00:59:04.702 --> 00:59:08.952
phones? I didn’t see the report, but
seven shocks me. Having that number

1945
00:59:08.952 --> 00:59:11.869
seven shocks me. Having that number
of children that young. I think

1946
00:59:11.869 --> 00:59:14.327
of children that young. I think
that, I hear what you are saying

1947
00:59:14.327 --> 00:59:15.869
that, I hear what you are saying
about young people being more savvy,

1948
00:59:15.869 --> 00:59:16.994
about young peopla being more savvy,
and I

1949
00:59:16.994 --> 00:59:18.619
about young people being more savvy,
and I think there is a generation,

1950
00:59:18.619 --> 00:59:20.327
and I think there is a generation,
digital natives, people who are much

1951
00:59:20.327 --> 00:59:20.536
digital natives, peopla who are much
more

1952
00:59:20.536 --> 00:59:21.702
digital natives, people who are much
more used to living their lives in

1953
00:59:21.702 --> 00:59:24.494
more used to living their lives in
social media, but in the same way

1954
00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.952
social media, but in the same way
that my kids, you teach them about

1955
00:59:26.952 --> 00:59:28.244
that my kids, you teach them about
road safety, you teach them about

1956
00:59:28.244 --> 00:59:31.161
road safety, you teach them about
being a bit careful, and I had a

1957
00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:34.952
being a bit careful, and I had a
very awkward dad conversation about,

1958
00:59:34.952 --> 00:59:36.411
very awkward dad conversation about,
you know, reminding them that what

1959
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:38.661
you know, reminding them that what
you upload and sent to your friends

1960
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:41.952
you upload and sent to your friends
never, ever, ever goes away, I

1961
00:59:41.952 --> 00:59:42.077
you upload and sent to your friends
never, ever, ever goes away, Isaid,

1962
00:59:42.077 --> 00:59:43.577
never, ever, ever goes away, Isaid,
if you don’t fancy having a picture

1963
00:59:43.577 --> 00:59:46.369
if you don’t fancy having a picture
perhaps brought up during a job

1964
00:59:46.369 --> 00:59:47.619
perhaps brought up during a job
interview in 20 years time, perhaps

1965
00:59:47.619 --> 00:59:49.327
interview in 20 years time, perhaps
don’t take it and send it to

1966
00:59:49.327 --> 00:59:50.911
don’t take it and send it to
someone, so I had to have some of

1967
00:59:50.911 --> 00:59:53.161
someone, so I had to have some of
those awkward conversations. Sarah

1968
00:59:53.161 --> 00:59:54.786
those awkward conversations. Sarah
is right, we need to look at social

1969
00:59:54.786 --> 00:59:57.536
is right, we need to look at social
media companies, and the ombudsman

1970
00:59:57.536 --> 01:00:00.452
media companies, and the ombudsman
will look at that, and we have to be

1971
01:00:00.452 --> 01:00:02.036
will look at that, and we have to be
very conscious about social

1972
01:00:02.036 --> 01:00:02.619
very conscious about social
pressure, addiction, online

1973
01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:05.786
pressure, addiction, online
bullying. There is a lot wrapped up

1974
01:00:05.786 --> 01:00:07.286
bullying. There is a lot wrapped up
in this, but I think mobile phones

1975
01:00:07.286 --> 01:00:08.869
in this, but I think mobile phones
are an inevitable part of modern

1976
01:00:08.869 --> 01:00:11.911
are an inevitable part of modern
life, but we have to be careful.

1977
01:00:11.911 --> 01:00:13.536
life, but we have to be careful.
Could keep talking about this, but I

1978
01:00:13.536 --> 01:00:15.119
Could keep talking about this, but I
am afraid we are out of time.

1979
01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:16.077
Could keep talking about this, but I
am afraid we are out of time. The

1980
