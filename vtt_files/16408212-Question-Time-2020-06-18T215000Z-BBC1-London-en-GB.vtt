1
00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:04.990
You killed him. How?

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.073
A single moment,
everything can change.

3
00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:14.698
So...

4
00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.781
I shot a man last week.

5
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.115
Really?!

6
00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:23.531
Nobody normally gets killed
‘round here.

7
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:25.406
Itjust breaks your heart.

8
00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:26.740
And you won’t believe this.

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.115
0h?

10
00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:29.323
It was with a harpoon gun.

11
00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:31.656
Typical.

12
00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.781
ALL GIGGLE

13
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.531
Stop it! Stop it!
Oof.

14
00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:41.198
This is a nice, civilised evening.

15
00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:43.781

49
00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:40.115
What does it tell us about this
government’s priorities

50
00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:44.115
that it was forced into a U turn
by a footballer so that the poorest

51
00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.865
children in the country would be fed
during the summer holidays?

52
00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:58.573
Obviously talking about the free
school meal vouchers for children.

53
00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:03.365
James?

54
00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:03.698
m:

55
00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:07.115
We have had to bring about an
unprecedented range of support

56
00:03:07.115 --> 00:03:10.115
unprecedented range of support
packages for individuals, for

57
00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:11.615
packages for individuals, for
businesses, for the self—employed

58
00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:12.031
businesses, for the self-employed
and for

59
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:13.031
businesses, for the self—employed
and for families.

60
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.240
businesses, for the self—employed
and forfamilies. We

61
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.781
businesses, for the self—employed
and for families. We were not going

62
00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:16.448
and for families. We were not going
to do this until Marcus Rashford

63
00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:17.906
to do this until Marcus Rashford
spoke up. We had already supported

64
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.990
spoke up. We had already supported
families to help feed their children

65
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.115
families to help feed their children
duﬂng

66
00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:24.281
families to help feed their children
during the Easter break and

67
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.615
during the Easter break and
ultimately, we are trying to get

68
00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:28.156
ultimately, we are trying to get
back to more normal way of working

69
00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:32.823
back to more normal way of working
and we had hoped that we would not

70
00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:34.406
and we had hoped that we would not
need to put this additional support

71
00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:36.531
need to put this additional support
package in place over the summer,

72
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:38.906
package in place over the summer,
but we do listen and the government

73
00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:40.948
but we do listen and the government
did listen and Marcus put forward a

74
00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:45.031
did listen and Marcus put forward a
really compelling argument and we

75
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:47.406
really compelling argument and we
did listen and the government

76
00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:49.615
did listen and the government
decided to extend the existing

77
00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:51.448
decided to extend the existing
scheme into the summer holidays. I

78
00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:54.240
scheme into the summer holidays. I
think it was the right thing to do

79
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.531
think it was the right thing to do
and ultimately what we are trying to

80
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.115
and ultimately what we are trying to
do, it is we are trying to get back

81
00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:01.115
do, it is we are trying to get back
towards normality, because really

82
00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.448
towards normality, because really
that is what everyone wants and that

83
00:04:02.448 --> 00:04:10.031
that is what everyone wants and that
is what we are working towards. Jed.

84
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:11.073
is what we are working towards. jed.
I think we

85
00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:11.823
is what we are working towards. Jed.
I think we should pay tribute to

86
00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:13.031
I think we should pay tribute to
Marcus Rashford for the campaign,

87
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:18.531
Marcus Rashford for the campaign,
what a great example he is and he is

88
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.448
what a great example he is and he is
a great footballer as well, I am a

89
00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:22.240
a great footballer as well, I am a
Manchester United fan and I am

90
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.448
Manchester United fan and I am
biased! What I would also say, I

91
00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:25.865
biased! What I would also say, I
sometimes despair of hearing things

92
00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:26.073
sometimes despair of hearing things
railed

93
00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:27.323
sometimes despair of hearing things
called U—turns. I

94
00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:27.531
sometimes despair of hearing things
called U—turns. Ithink

95
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.865
sometimes despair of hearing things
called U—turns. I think it stops

96
00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:31.323
rallad U-turns. Ithink it stops
peopla in

97
00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:31.948
called U—turns. I think it stops
people in positions of authority,

98
00:04:31.948 --> 00:04:34.115
peopla in positions of authority,
from

99
00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:34.948
people in positions of authority,
from listening and changing their

100
00:04:34.948 --> 00:04:37.615
from listening and changing their
minds and responding to the

101
00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:41.073
minds and responding to the
democratic force that got behind the

102
00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:42.031
democratic force that got behind the
campaign that Marcus started and

103
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.031
campaign that Marcus started and
sometimes I worry that if we use

104
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:48.573
sometimes I worry that if we use
that type of language, it sometimes

105
00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:51.073
that type of language, it sometimes
makes it more difficult for

106
00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:53.740
makes it more difficult for
governments to do the right thing

107
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.573
governments to do the right thing
and I would definitely say,

108
00:04:56.573 --> 00:04:58.615
and I would definitely say,
something that we should all

109
00:04:58.615 --> 00:04:59.948
something that we should all
welcome, the fact that the

110
00:04:59.948 --> 00:05:01.781
welcome, the fact that the
government listened and acted in the

111
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:01.948
government listened and acted in the
“Y

112
00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:03.531
government listened and acted in the
way it had. Charlie, you are a

113
00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:03.823
way it had. Chartie, you are a
teacher,

114
00:05:03.823 --> 00:05:06.031
way it had. Charlie, you are a
teacher, what would your response?

115
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:09.031
teacher, what would your response?
jed, if you use

116
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:09.656
teacher, what would your response?
Jed, if you use language like a

117
00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:09.781
jed, if you use language like a
U-turn

118
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:11.198
Jed, if you use language like a
U—turn and if you do the right thing

119
00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:11.865
U-turn and if you do the right thing
in the first

120
00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:12.531
U—turn and if you do the right thing
in the first place, you would not

121
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:15.448
in the first place, you would not
need to use that language. I see

122
00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.865
need to use that language. I see
every day how these vouchers make an

123
00:05:17.865 --> 00:05:19.365
every day how these vouchers make an
impact and the difference of a child

124
00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.490
impact and the difference of a child
having a meal and coming to school

125
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.865
having a meal and coming to school
is far greater than not having one

126
00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:25.240
is far greater than not having one
at all and gives opportunity to them

127
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.031
at all and gives opportunity to them
to be able to flourish and for that,

128
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:28.531
to be able to ﬂourish and for that,
there is no

129
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:32.406
to be able to flourish and for that,
there is no price. Steve? I would

130
00:05:32.406 --> 00:05:33.240
there is no price. Steve? I would
agree with jed,

131
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.823
there is no price. Steve? I would
agree withJed, I think Marcus

132
00:05:33.823 --> 00:05:36.156
agree withJed, I think Marcus
Rashford is an example and lots of

133
00:05:36.156 --> 00:05:37.865
Rashford is an example and lots of
footballers have been through this

134
00:05:37.865 --> 00:05:39.448
footballers have been through this
crisis, or people who know the right

135
00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:40.323
crisis, or peopla who know the right
thing to do, do

136
00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:41.615
crisis, or people who know the right
thing to do, do the right thing and

137
00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:43.906
thing to do, do the right thing and
act on the right way. I also agree

138
00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:44.906
act on the right way. I also agree
with jed that

139
00:05:44.906 --> 00:05:45.365
act on the right way. I also agree
with Jed that the language

140
00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:45.490
act on the right way. I also agree
withJed that the language of

141
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.198
withJed that the language of
U—turns and all of this kind of

142
00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:50.073
U-turns and all of this kind of
things that

143
00:05:50.073 --> 00:05:50.865
U—turns and all of this kind of
things that we throw at politician

144
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:52.448
things that we throw at politician
mean we do not get to the right

145
00:05:52.448 --> 00:05:54.115
mean we do not get to the right
answer and it is important to get to

146
00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:55.615
answer and it is important to get to
the right answer and I am pleased we

147
00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:56.073
the right answer and I am pleased we
did, I

148
00:05:56.073 --> 00:05:56.906
the right answer and I am pleased we
did, Ithink it is the

149
00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:57.990
the right answer and I am pleased we
did, I think it is the right thing

150
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.740
did, I think it is the right thing
and I am pleased that Marcus showed

151
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.865
and I am pleased that Marcus showed
our profession in the light I see it

152
00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:05.448
our profession in the light I see it
in everyday. Long may the

153
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.948
in everyday. Long may the
government, any government we have,

154
00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:08.156
government, any government we have,
continue to listen to the right

155
00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:09.156
continue to listen to the right
argument to make the right

156
00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:11.740
argument to make the right
decisions. One of the things that

157
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.573
decisions. One of the things that
were so compelling about Marcus

158
00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:14.865
were so compelling about Marcus
Rashford was him talking about his

159
00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:17.448
Rashford was him talking about his
own experience of poverty as a

160
00:06:17.448 --> 00:06:19.073
own experience of poverty as a
child, going to his friends houses

161
00:06:19.073 --> 00:06:21.823
child, going to his friends houses
when food was short in his own home.

162
00:06:21.823 --> 00:06:23.073
when food was short in his own home.
Are there other footballers that you

163
00:06:23.073 --> 00:06:24.240
Are there other footballers that you
know who have had that life

164
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.365
know who have had that life
experience? The vast majority of

165
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:29.156
experience? The vast majority of
footballers come from backgrounds

166
00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:30.365
footballers come from backgrounds
that would not be considered

167
00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:33.781
that would not be considered
affluent. And what a lot of people

168
00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:35.823
afﬂuent. And what a lot of peopla
don’t

169
00:06:35.823 --> 00:06:36.656
affluent. And what a lot of people
don’t realise is what an extended

170
00:06:36.656 --> 00:06:37.865
don’t realise is what an extended
network of people they look after

171
00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.073
network of peopla they look after
and are

172
00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:40.448
network of people they look after
and are responsible for,

173
00:06:40.448 --> 00:06:41.656
and are responsible for,
particularly many of the players

174
00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:41.865
particularty many of the players
that

175
00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:45.531
particularly many of the players
that come from overseas. The picture

176
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:46.865
that come from overseas. The picture
that is portrayed of footballers as

177
00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.240
that is portrayed of footballers as
being young men with too much money,

178
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.156
being young men with too much money,
it really is not fair in most of the

179
00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:51.365
it really is not fair in most of the
rases

180
00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:52.573
it really is not fair in most of the
cases that I have come into contact

181
00:06:52.573 --> 00:06:55.448
cases that I have come into contact
with. I have been incredibly proud

182
00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.823
with. I have been incredibly proud
of all the players that I know and

183
00:06:58.823 --> 00:07:01.448
of all the players that I know and
the way they have acted through the

184
00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:02.823
the way they have acted through the
whole crisis. Lisa, the question is

185
00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:03.156
whola crisis. Lisa, the question is
what does

186
00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.198
whole crisis. Lisa, the question is
what does it tell us about the

187
00:07:04.198 --> 00:07:05.406
what does it tell us about the
priorities of the government that it

188
00:07:05.406 --> 00:07:07.990
priorities of the government that it
was forced into this decision by

189
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.990
was forced into this decision by
Marcus Rashford. I agree with

190
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.323
was forced into this decision by
Marcus Rashford. I agree withJed, I

191
00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:12.615
Marcus Rashford. Iagree with jed, I
welcome

192
00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:14.031
Marcus Rashford. I agree withJed, I
welcome the fact that the government

193
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:16.031
welcome the fact that the government
did a U—turn on this and I think the

194
00:07:16.031 --> 00:07:16.406
did a U-turn on this and I think the
campaign that

195
00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.865
did a U—turn on this and I think the
campaign that Marcus Rashford led

196
00:07:18.865 --> 00:07:19.240
campaign that Marcus Rashford lad
was really

197
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.073
campaign that Marcus Rashford led
was really inspirational, but it

198
00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:22.073
was really inspirational, but it
should not take a brave young

199
00:07:22.073 --> 00:07:23.073
should not take a brave young
footballer to shame the government

200
00:07:23.073 --> 00:07:26.490
footballer to shame the government
into action. The real question is

201
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.073
into action. The real question is
how ran

202
00:07:27.073 --> 00:07:28.198
into action. The real question is
how can we possibly only 48 hours

203
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:28.781
how ran we possibly only 48 hours
ago still have

204
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:29.406
how can we possibly only 48 hours
ago still have been debating whether

205
00:07:29.406 --> 00:07:31.948
ago still have been debating whether
or not we were going to allow some

206
00:07:31.948 --> 00:07:33.115
or not we were going to allow some
children to go starving hungry over

207
00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:36.573
children to go starving hungry over
the school holidays. Even on the day

208
00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:38.198
the school holidays. Even on the day
that we had that vote in the Houses

209
00:07:38.198 --> 00:07:40.573
that we had that vote in the Houses
of Parliament, that Labour had

210
00:07:40.573 --> 00:07:40.781
of Partiament, that labour had
rallad

211
00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:41.781
of Parliament, that Labour had
called and the date the government

212
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:44.073
called and the date the government
decided to U—turn, the Prime

213
00:07:44.073 --> 00:07:44.573
decided to U-turn, the Prime
Minister

214
00:07:44.573 --> 00:07:46.406
decided to U—turn, the Prime
Minister was at the dispatch box

215
00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:47.531
Minister was at the dispatch box
denying the existence of children

216
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:49.531
denying the existence of children
who have been pushed into poverty

217
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:51.573
who have been pushed into poverty
since 2012 and the fact that that is

218
00:07:51.573 --> 00:07:56.865
since 2012 and the fact that that is
projected to rise. This is a result

219
00:07:56.865 --> 00:07:58.698
projected to rise. This is a result
of an approach to government that

220
00:07:58.698 --> 00:07:59.490
of an approach to government that
has systematically stripped support

221
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.823
has systematically stripped support
away from children over the last

222
00:08:01.823 --> 00:08:04.031
away from children over the last
decade, so that now

223
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:04.823
away from children over the last
decade, so that new schools in my

224
00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:05.073
decade, so that now schools in my
constituency

225
00:08:05.073 --> 00:08:07.073
decade, so that new schools in my
constituency have to

226
00:08:07.073 --> 00:08:07.656
decade, so that now schools in my
constituency have to employ workers,

227
00:08:07.656 --> 00:08:10.115
constituency have to employ workers,
using the Pupil Premium to go to the

228
00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.573
using the Pupil Premium to go to the
houses of children, put money in the

229
00:08:12.573 --> 00:08:13.698
houses of children, put money in the

parents simply do not have enough

let’s get back to a new normal and

238
00:08:24.073 --> 00:08:26.656
let’s get back to a new normal and
build a better country based on

239
00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:28.115
build a better country based on
better values when we come out the

240
00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:30.198
better values when we come out the
other side of this. These children

241
00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:31.823
other side of this. These children
have been last up to now and been

242
00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:33.615
have been last up to now and been
invisible and let us make sure that

invisibla and let us make sure that
when we

244

invisible and let us make sure that
when we rebuild this country, let us

when we rebuild this country, let us
change that make sure that come

Looking at the root of the question

251
00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:51.698
Looking at the root of the question
that Charlie asked, in terms of what

252
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:52.656
that Chartie asked, in terms of what
does it say

253
00:08:52.656 --> 00:08:53.365
that Charlie asked, in terms of what
does it say about the government and

254
00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:59.490
does it say about the government and
like you say, it took such a high

255
00:08:59.490 --> 00:08:59.781
like you say, it took such a high
profilo

256
00:08:59.781 --> 00:09:00.573
like you say, it took such a high
profile footballer for that to

257
00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.823
profila footballar for that to
happen.

258
00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:07.906
profile footballer for that to
happen. If we are responding to

259
00:09:07.906 --> 00:09:09.323
happen. If we are responding to
coronavirus and the millions put

260
00:09:09.323 --> 00:09:11.031
coronavirus and the millions put
into this, in order to get to that

261
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:16.115
into this, in order to get to that
new normal, how can we trust the

262
00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:16.198
new normal, how ran we trust the
government

263
00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:17.281
new normal, how can we trust the
government that they are going to

264
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:20.323
government that they are going to
make those decisions, without having

265
00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:27.031
make those decisions, without having
the intervention? Munira? In 2020 in

266
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:28.656
the intervention? Munira? In 2020 in
the United Kingdom no child should

267
00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:30.240
the United Kingdom no child should
be going hungry and the fact that it

268
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.865
be going hungry and the fact that it
has taken a footballer to help the

269
00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:36.198
has taken a footballer to help the
government to realise that and

270
00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:37.198
government to realise that and
actually change

271
00:09:37.198 --> 00:09:38.365
government to realise that and
actually change its policy I think

272
00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:42.281
actually change its policy I think
is shameful, frankly. It is not a

273
00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.656
is shameful, frankly. It is not a
new issue, holiday hunger, we know

274
00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:46.740
new issue, holiday hunger, we know
that several billion children suffer

275
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.073
that several billion children suffer
from holiday hunger normally and

276
00:09:48.073 --> 00:09:50.115
from holiday hunger normally and
that is honestly exacerbated by the

277
00:09:50.115 --> 00:09:51.823
that is honestly exacerbated by the
crisis that we face. With the

278
00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:51.948
crisis that we face. with the
Liberal

279
00:09:51.948 --> 00:09:53.240
crisis that we face. With the
Liberal Democrats pushing to extend

280
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.031
Liberal Democrats pushing to extend
this? Yes. In Wales, we have a

281
00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:00.448
this? Yes. In Wales, we have a
Liberal Democrat Education Secretary

282
00:10:00.448 --> 00:10:02.031
Liberal Democrat Education Secretary
and she committed to funding school

283
00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:03.240
and she committed to funding school
meals through the summer some time

284
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.573
meals through the summer some time
ago and this is something we have

285
00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:06.740
ago and this is something we have
been pushing for and indeed, so had

286
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.573
been pushing for and indeed, so had
the Labour Party and a number of

287
00:10:11.573 --> 00:10:11.823
the labour Party and a number of
other

288
00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.656
the Labour Party and a number of
other opposition parties. We are

289
00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:14.990
other opposition parties. We are
hugely grateful to Marcus Rashford

290
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.031
hugely grateful to Marcus Rashford
and I am a huge fan of his and I

291
00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:20.115
and I am a huge fan of his and I
wish we were watching him in their

292
00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:22.281
wish we were watching him in their
Euro 2020 at the moment, but we find

293
00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:24.781
Euro 2020 at the moment, but we find
ourselves in the circumstances and I

294
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:28.573
ourselves in the circumstances and I
am grateful that he has forced the

295
00:10:28.573 --> 00:10:31.073
am grateful that he has forced the
government to make this change and

296
00:10:31.073 --> 00:10:32.656
government to make this change and
so will many millions of children

up to the change of heart on this,

00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:40.823
up to the change of heart on this,
you had Cabinet ministers saying, we

you had Cabinet ministers saying, we
are not going to change your mind,

pops up and that is the thing that

310
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.740
pops up and that is the thing that
makes the difference? It is worth

311
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.740
makes the difference? It is worth
remembering that this is a scheme

312
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.031
remembering that this is a scheme
that we had already put in place, we

313

that we had already put in place, we
are talking about extending an

are talking about extending an
existing scheme. It is also worth

315

existing scheme. It is also worth
remembering that the unprecedented

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:06.781
remembering that the unprecedented
circumstances that we find ourselves

317
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:08.156
circumstances that we find ourselves
in has meant that the government

318
00:11:08.156 --> 00:11:11.698
in has meant that the government
have put forward a range of support

319
00:11:11.698 --> 00:11:13.031
have put forward a range of support
packages at a scale that we have

320
00:11:13.031 --> 00:11:15.490
packages at a scale that we have
never seen before in British

321
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.781
never seen before in British
politic. So,

322
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:18.406
never seen before in British
politics. 50, we are absolutely

323
00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:20.365
politics. 50, we are absolutely
determined to make sure that

324
00:11:20.365 --> 00:11:23.156
determined to make sure that
families can put food on the table

325
00:11:23.156 --> 00:11:23.615
families ran put food on the table
and that

326
00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:25.115
families can put food on the table
and that is why we are supporting

327
00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:25.781
and that is why we are supporting
peopla who

328
00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:28.365
and that is why we are supporting
people who are furloughed at the

329
00:11:28.365 --> 00:11:32.240
people who are furloughed at the
moment and we are working so hard to

330
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.698
moment and we are working so hard to
get through this unbelievably

331
00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:37.365
get through this unbelievably
difficult set of circumstances.

332
00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:42.156
difficult set of circumstances.
Ultimately, we are trying to balance

333
00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:44.115
Ultimately, we are trying to balance
the competing financial and social

334
00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:48.031
the competing financial and social
pressures and sometimes, when

335
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:48.615
pressures and sometimes, when
someone shines a

336
00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:48.781
pressures and sometimes, when
someone shines alight

337
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:49.240
pressures and sometimes, when
someone shines a light on a

338
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240
someone shines a light on a
particular issue and we look again

339
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.615
particular issue and we look again
at it and we make the decision that

340
00:11:53.615 --> 00:11:56.698
at it and we make the decision that
this is something that we can extend

341
00:11:56.698 --> 00:11:56.906
this is something that we ran extend
and

342
00:11:56.906 --> 00:11:58.115
this is something that we can extend
and should extend through the summer

343
00:11:58.115 --> 00:11:59.573
and should extend through the summer
and I am grateful that Marcus did

344
00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:00.031
and I am grateful that Marcus did
that, I

345
00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:00.448
and I am grateful that Marcus did
that, Iam very

346
00:12:00.448 --> 00:12:02.073
and I am grateful that Marcus did
that, I am very grateful that we

347
00:12:02.073 --> 00:12:04.531
that, I am very grateful that we
listened and I’m grateful that we

348
00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:04.823
listened and I’m grateful that we
responded. 0K,

349
00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:06.198
listened and I’m grateful that we
responded. OK, let’s take another

350
00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:11.115
responded. OK, let’s take another
question, from Debbie Norrish. Good

351
00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:13.656
question, from Debbie Norrish. Good
evening everyone.

352
00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:16.698
Is a delay in learning of 6 months
genuinely devastating to a whole

353
00:12:16.698 --> 00:12:19.323
generation as the chief inspector
of schools has stated?

354
00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:23.948
That was suggested by the former
head, the Chief Inspector of

355
00:12:23.948 --> 00:12:25.240
head, the Chief Inspector of
Schools.

356
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.281
Jed?

357
00:12:26.281 --> 00:12:28.948
Devastating for a whole generation?

358
00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:31.823
I think the problem with sending
kids back to school and the

359
00:12:31.823 --> 00:12:35.448
delay is something we should
all be concerned about.

360
00:12:35.448 --> 00:12:39.406
I think the fact is that the time
that children spend in

361
00:12:39.406 --> 00:12:43.656
school at a vulnerable
age is precious time,

362
00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:46.823
and I think it will be very,
very hard for them to catch

363
00:12:46.823 --> 00:12:50.031
up, so I think that
definitely more should

364
00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:51.448
have been done in terms
of

365
00:12:51.448 --> 00:12:52.490
the planning.

366
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.365
I think that there has been
a failure of planning to get

367
00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:56.740
children back into school.

368
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.031
I think that,
obviously, the pandemic

369
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:02.740
arrangements have put
an enormous strain

370
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.031
on the infrastmclure
is in

371
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:09.031
our society, but I also
think that if you look

372
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:10.740
at what is required
for

373
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.740
children to go back to school, it’s
not just the fact that children need

374
00:13:15.823 --> 00:13:19.198
to go back to school —
it’s the society needs those

375
00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.115
children back into school,
because of all the

376
00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:25.115
things that surround
children being at school,

377
00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:28.448
not requiring childcare
and so forth.

378
00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:33.281
And I really wish that
the Government had gone about the

379
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:38.323
planning in a more forthright
and more detailed way.

380
00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:42.323
Deborah, I’m wondering,
you’re asking the

381
00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:44.448
question and I know you’re
a deputy headteacher.

382
00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.323
The way you phrase it makes me
wonder if you think it

383
00:13:47.323 --> 00:13:49.031
isn’t actually genuinely
devastating, or isn’t devastating

384
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:51.323
for a generation of children?

385
00:13:51.323 --> 00:13:53.115
It’s been absolutely awful.

386
00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:55.490
This week, so I work
at a secondary school in

387
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.656
Plymouth, and we’ve had
Year 105 and 125 back

388
00:13:57.656 --> 00:13:58.865
for the first time,
and

389
00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:01.240
first of all it’s absolutely
delightful to see them all.

390
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.406
But it’s absolutely
horrifying that we can’t

391
00:14:04.406 --> 00:14:06.323
provide more, and they
are desperate for it.

392
00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:11.281
Attendance this week
has been brilliant.

393
00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:16.823
You know, clearly home
learning isn’t doing the job

394
00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.490
for them that we needed to do.

395
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.406
We haven’t got clarity
yet on what is

396
00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:23.531
going to happen with their exams
next year and assessment, and we are

397
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:25.698
desperate for further guidance
about planning for September, school

398
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.781
leavers.

399
00:14:26.781 --> 00:14:29.115
Our students are becoming
disillusioned at not having that, I

400
00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:30.156
think.

401
00:14:30.156 --> 00:14:31.615
Marcia, you have your hand up.

402
00:14:31.615 --> 00:14:36.615
I’m a parent to a Year ten
and I Year 12 children, and I was

403
00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.240
wondering whether any
consideration is being

404
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.198
given to the request
for

405
00:14:41.198 --> 00:14:45.156
reducing the curriculum content,
for the GCSE and A—levels

406
00:14:45.156 --> 00:14:47.490
next summer.

407
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.698
Because of all the teaching
they will have missed?

408
00:14:49.698 --> 00:14:51.073
Exactly.

409
00:14:51.073 --> 00:14:52.990
Munira?

410
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.240
Well, I think everybody,
whether you are a parent,

411
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.781
teacher, a school governor,
everybody is desperate to get

412
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.240
children back to school.

413
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.781
We know the detrimental
impact it’s having on

414
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:08.656
their well being as well as on their
educational development, but clearly

415
00:15:08.656 --> 00:15:10.865
we have to do that when it is safe.

416
00:15:10.865 --> 00:15:15.573
And the Lib Dems have put a whole
range of suggestions in place for

417
00:15:15.573 --> 00:15:18.406
children going back to school,
so you are not in any great

418
00:15:18.406 --> 00:15:19.656
rush to get them back?

419
00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:24.031
We have put forward a plan
which includes things like

420
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:27.615
identifying safe spaces
that could then...

421
00:15:27.615 --> 00:15:30.406
Having a safe space register,
that would open up safe

422
00:15:30.406 --> 00:15:33.906
community spaces that could
potentially be used as additional

423
00:15:33.906 --> 00:15:36.073
space for schooling,
so you can then get kids

424
00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:38.948
back to school safely.

425
00:15:38.948 --> 00:15:43.990
My concern is, firstly,
the test and tray system clearly

426
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.406
My concern is, firstly,
the test and trace system clearly

427
00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:53.573
isn’t up and running properly,
and forany part

428
00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:56.948
of lockdown, whether that is schools
or parts of the economy to be opened

429
00:15:56.948 --> 00:15:59.573
up, we need to be testing,
tracing and isolating every single

430
00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:00.823
case to keep people safe.

431
00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:02.948
The other thing is just
the lack of plan.

432
00:16:02.948 --> 00:16:03.990
AsJed was saying.

433
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.281
I would have hoped there would have
been a plan put forward

434
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:10.406
with a range of scenarios perhaps
and certainly I was talking to head

435
00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:13.698
teachers in my constituency
on Wednesday and they said to me, we

436
00:16:13.698 --> 00:16:18.656
urgently need a plan so we can start
to prepare for September, so we know

437
00:16:19.198 --> 00:16:22.115
what we are doing.

438
00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:27.115
But we need that now.

439
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.781
Let’s see if we can find
out what the plan is.

440
00:16:39.406 --> 00:16:40.448
We have James here.

441
00:16:40.448 --> 00:16:43.115
One thing I would like to
add, a lot of parents

442
00:16:43.115 --> 00:16:44.281
feel they haven’t had
a

443
00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:46.198
voice in this debate
and there’s been this

444
00:16:46.198 --> 00:16:47.448
big blame game going
on

445
00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:50.531
between Government and the unions,
and the reason we ended up with a

446
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:52.990
slight change of guidance for
primary schools because there was

447
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.115
that lack of engagement and
communication between government and

448
00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:57.073
schools and unions to
understand what was workable.

449
00:16:57.073 --> 00:16:58.448
0K, what is the plan, James?

450
00:16:58.448 --> 00:16:59.698
I have two boys school.

451
00:16:59.698 --> 00:17:02.490
My eldest has just finished, and
unfortunately wasn’t able to sit his

452
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.615
A—levels.

453
00:17:03.615 --> 00:17:08.573
So I know the huge and
understandable desire that parents,

454
00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:10.365
teaching professionals,
the natural desire

455
00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:11.531
they have for certainty
and

456
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.698
clarity.

457
00:17:13.698 --> 00:17:16.115
This is an evolving situation.

458
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.198
You’re going to have to wait
for the announcement.

459
00:17:31.198 --> 00:17:31.490
ﬂ

460
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.115
I don’t want to steal the thunder of
my colleagues in education. The

461
00:17:36.115 --> 00:17:38.073
my colleagues in education. The
point is we are evolving the plan as

462
00:17:38.073 --> 00:17:39.781
point is we are evolving the plan as
we learn more about the nature of

463
00:17:39.781 --> 00:17:41.531
we learn more about the nature of
the vims.

464
00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:43.073
we learn more about the nature of
the virus. We’ve got to make sure

465
00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:43.198
the vims. We’ve got to make sure
the

466
00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:46.865
the virus. We’ve got to make sure
the students are safe, that the

467
00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:49.073
the students are safe, that the
teaching professionals are safe, and

468
00:17:49.073 --> 00:17:52.198
teaching professionals are safe, and
so this will mean we are having to

469
00:17:52.198 --> 00:17:54.281
so this will mean we are having to
adapt, and that is disconcerting,

470
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:55.781
adapt, and that is disconcerting,
hugely disconcerting for parents. We

471
00:17:55.781 --> 00:17:58.698
hugely disconcerting for parents. We
completely understand that. But we

472
00:17:58.698 --> 00:18:00.865
completely understand that. But we
want to make sure children don’t

473
00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:02.990
want to make sure children don’t
miss out on their education.

474
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.781
miss out on their education.
Education is incredibly important,

475
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:04.365
Education is incredibly important,
and it’s not

476
00:18:04.365 --> 00:18:05.156
Education is incredibly important,
and it’s notjust about the

477
00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:05.573
and it’s not just about the
syllabus.

478
00:18:05.573 --> 00:18:08.573
and it’s notjust about the
syllabus. It’s also about the social

479
00:18:08.573 --> 00:18:10.406
syllabus. It’s also about the social
interactions. So we want to make

480
00:18:10.406 --> 00:18:11.031
interactions. So we want to make
sure we

481
00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:14.448
interactions. 50 we want to make
sure we can re—establish teaching

482
00:18:14.448 --> 00:18:15.198
sure we ran re-establish teaching
provision in a

483
00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:16.906
sure we can re—establish teaching
provision in a way that is safe for

484
00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:18.781
provision in a way that is safe for
the students, for the staff, for the

485
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:20.031
the students, for the staff, for the
teaching professionals and of course

486
00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:20.240
teaching professionals and of course
their

487
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.323
teaching professionals and of course
theirfamilies. But isn’t

488
00:18:24.323 --> 00:18:24.615
teaching professionals and of course
their families. But isn’t it

489
00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:25.490
their families. But isn’t it
confusing for parents and students

490
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.198
confusing for parents and students
alike when there was a plan

491
00:18:29.198 --> 00:18:31.656
alike when there was a plan
announced? If I recall, it was that

492
00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:34.406
announced? If I recall, it was that
schools would go back on the 1st of

493
00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:34.906
schools would go back on the 1st of
june, and

494
00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:35.656
schools would go back on the lst of
June, and Michael Gove said it

495
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:35.948
schools would go back on the 1st of
June, and Michael Gove said it was

496
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:36.240
june, and Michael Gove said it was
safe for

497
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.948
June, and Michael Gove said it was
safe for them to go back on the 1st

498
00:18:37.948 --> 00:18:38.990
safe for them to go back on the 1st
of june, and it

499
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.448
safe for them to go back on the 1st
ofJune, and it was predicated on

500
00:18:41.448 --> 00:18:43.323
of june, and it was predicated on
having... I hate

501
00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:44.531
ofJune, and it was predicated on
having... I hate to use the phrase,

502
00:18:44.531 --> 00:18:46.323
having... I hate to use the phrase,
but world beating test entry system.

503
00:18:46.323 --> 00:18:48.198
but world beating test entry system.
There has been a failure to achieve

504
00:18:48.198 --> 00:18:54.156
There has been a failure to achieve
that. We need safety —— test and

505
00:18:54.156 --> 00:18:54.573
that. We need safety -- test and
tray system.

506
00:18:54.573 --> 00:18:55.865
that. We need safety —— test and
tray system. We need a functioning

507
00:18:55.865 --> 00:18:58.031
tray system. We need a functioning
test and trace system and low levels

508
00:18:58.031 --> 00:18:58.906
test and trace system and low levels
of transmission. It’s not

509
00:18:58.906 --> 00:18:59.823
test and trace system and low levels
of transmission. It’s notjust about

510
00:18:59.823 --> 00:19:00.323
of transmission. It’s not just about
it being safer

511
00:19:00.323 --> 00:19:01.615
of transmission. It’s notjust about
it being safer kids to go back to

512
00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:03.740
it being safer kids to go back to
school. It has to be said for

513
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.573
school. It has to be said for
society. They travel. They interact

514
00:19:06.573 --> 00:19:07.906
society. They travel. They interact
with staff. Those staff members

515
00:19:07.906 --> 00:19:10.198
with staff. Those staff members
interact with people in their

516
00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:12.115
interact with people in their
households. And possibly the disease

517
00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:13.198
households. And possibly the disease
ran be

518
00:19:13.198 --> 00:19:14.031
households. And possibly the disease
can be transmitted to vulnerable

519
00:19:14.031 --> 00:19:15.281
ran be transmitted to vulnerable
people.

520
00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:17.365
people.
So there has been a total failure to

521
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.281
So there has been a total failure to
deliver on the promises and that has

522
00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:22.156
deliver on the promises and that has
caused a great deal of confusion.

523
00:19:22.156 --> 00:19:25.115
caused a great deal of confusion.
Well, I’m going to have to disagree

524
00:19:25.115 --> 00:19:28.281
Well, I’m going to have to disagree
with you on the point you’re making

525
00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:30.198
with you on the point you’re making
about the requirement for test and

526
00:19:30.198 --> 00:19:32.031
about the requirement for test and
trace and are planning around that,

527
00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:34.115
trace and are planning around that,
the delivery of that. We now have a

528
00:19:34.115 --> 00:19:37.531
the delivery of that. We now have a
testing system which test huge

529
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:39.448
testing system which test huge
numbers of people on a daily basis,

530
00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:39.615
numbers of peopla on a daily basis,
hundreds

531
00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:44.365
numbers of people on a daily basis,
hundreds of thousands of people, and

532
00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:44.823
hundreds of thousands of peopla, and
that was

533
00:19:44.823 --> 00:19:50.073
hundreds of thousands of people, and
that was driven forward.

534
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.323
that was driven forward. Set
incredibly challenging targets to

535
00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:52.531
incredibly challanging targets to
expand

536
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:54.240
incredibly challenging targets to
expand that. I think we might get

537
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.115
expand that. I think we might get
onto this in a moment, and that’s

538
00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:57.615
onto this in a moment, and that’s
absolutely fine. They are just some

539
00:19:57.615 --> 00:20:00.323
absolutely fine. They are just some
hands up in the audience. Tony? Yes,

540
00:20:00.323 --> 00:20:03.073
hands up in the audience. Tony? Yes,
hello. One of the things bugging me

541
00:20:03.073 --> 00:20:04.823
hello. One of the things bugging me
about all of this, everything comes

542
00:20:04.823 --> 00:20:07.823
about all of this, everything comes
down to the Government has to have a

543
00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:09.031
down to the Government has to have a
plan, and the Government does have

544
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:11.948
plan, and the Government does have
to have a plan. Some of the ideas

545
00:20:11.948 --> 00:20:14.198
to have a plan. Some of the ideas
that have come through are, frankly,

546
00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:17.531
that have come through are, frankly,
just incomprehensible. I was just

547
00:20:17.531 --> 00:20:19.073
just incomprehensible. I was just
listening today to somebody saying

548
00:20:19.073 --> 00:20:22.031
listening today to somebody saying
that the problem is we don’t have

549
00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:25.031
that the problem is we don’t have
enough space. We can open hotels, we

550
00:20:25.031 --> 00:20:25.573
enough space. We ran open hotels, we
ran put up

551
00:20:25.573 --> 00:20:26.990
enough space. We can open hotels, we
can put up marquees, and that way we

552
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.031
ran put up marquees, and that way we
ran get more kids

553
00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:28.615
can put up marquees, and that way we
can get more kids back into school.

554
00:20:28.615 --> 00:20:29.698
ran get more kids back into school.
Great

555
00:20:29.698 --> 00:20:31.490
can get more kids back into school.
Great idea. It begs the question,

556
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.698
Great idea. It begs the question,
where are the teachers? Because you

557
00:20:33.698 --> 00:20:35.490
where are the teachers? Because you
wouldn’t have enough teachers to do

558
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.490
wouldn’t have enough teachers to do
that, and those teachers we have

559
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.531
that, and those teachers we have
got, about 40% of them don’t want to

560
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:44.490
got, about 4096 of them don’t want to
go back anyway.

561
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.240
got, about 40% of them don’t want to
go back anyway. Sue? We all know

562
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.948
go back anyway. Sue? We all know
education is a great social leveller

563
00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:48.490
education is a great social laveller
and a great

564
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.740
education is a great social leveller
and a great force for social

565
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.240
and a great force for social
mobility, and with rising inequality

566
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.740
mobility, and with rising inequality
in the UK the fact that these

567
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.781
in the UK the fact that these
children...

568
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.323
children... The question of whether
six months of school is devastating

569
00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:03.823
six months of school is devastating
for a whole generation. Those

570
00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:05.365
for a whole generation. Those
children with no access to the

571
00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:06.865
children with no access to the
internet, no computers at school, no

572
00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:08.448
internet, no computers at school, no
books on the book shelves behind

573
00:21:08.448 --> 00:21:10.656
books on the book shelves behind
them, these are the children who are

574
00:21:10.656 --> 00:21:11.115
them, these are the children who are
particularty

575
00:21:11.115 --> 00:21:12.198
them, these are the children who are
particularly suffering from this,

576
00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:12.656
particularty suffering from this,
and

577
00:21:12.656 --> 00:21:14.406
particularly suffering from this,
and until we have, I’m sorry to

578
00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.531
and until we have, I’m sorry to
repeat it, but until we have

579
00:21:16.531 --> 00:21:18.698
repeat it, but until we have
effective tracing in place, testing

580
00:21:18.698 --> 00:21:21.031
effective tracing in place, testing
and tracing, we can’t get there. We

581
00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.115
and tracing, we can’t get there. We
cannot have like on the Isle of

582
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:23.365
cannot have like on the Isla of
Wight

583
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:23.490
cannot have like on the Isla of
Night 9095

584
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.823
cannot have like on the Isle of
Wight 90% of those people who are

585
00:21:24.823 --> 00:21:25.365
Night 9096 of those peopla who are
traced

586
00:21:25.365 --> 00:21:28.240
Wight 90% of those people who are
traced disappearing into the ether.

587
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.073
traced disappearing into the ether.
Deborah, you have your hand up.

588
00:21:30.073 --> 00:21:32.698
Deborah, you have your hand up.
Coming back to James about the

589
00:21:32.698 --> 00:21:33.073
Coming back to james about the
points and

590
00:21:33.073 --> 00:21:34.115
Coming back to James about the
points and the vision to get

591
00:21:34.115 --> 00:21:35.365
points and the vision to get
students back into school, which is

592
00:21:35.365 --> 00:21:37.490
students back into school, which is
exactly what we all want, the

593
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.656
exactly what we all want, the
implementation of some of the

594
00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:40.365
implementation of some of the
policies the Government have

595
00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:43.573
policies the Government have
suggested haven’t necessarily turned

596
00:21:43.573 --> 00:21:45.531
suggested haven’t necessarily turned
out as planned. The school laptops,

597
00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:50.073
out as planned. The school laptops,
for example, in our school, the

598
00:21:50.073 --> 00:21:50.781
for example, in our school, the
disadvantaged laptop still haven’t

599
00:21:50.781 --> 00:21:54.573
disadvantaged laptop still haven’t
arrived. I know that announcement

600
00:21:54.573 --> 00:21:56.156
arrived. I know that announcement
today of the National tutoring

601
00:21:56.156 --> 00:21:57.948
today of the National tutoring
programme, in theory it sounds

602
00:21:57.948 --> 00:21:59.615
programme, in theory it sounds
fabulous, but in reality have we got

603
00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:00.823
fabulous, but in reality have we got
the capacity to implement what the

604
00:22:00.823 --> 00:22:03.115
the capacity to implement what the
Government are trying to suggest?

605
00:22:03.115 --> 00:22:07.323
Government are trying to suggest?
Lisa? Well, the question was about

606
00:22:07.323 --> 00:22:09.281
Lisa? Well, the question was about
the impact on children, and I think

607
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:10.948
the impact on children, and I think
there is no question that this is

608
00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:13.073
there is no question that this is
going to have a big impact on this

609
00:22:13.073 --> 00:22:14.531
going to have a big impact on this
generation. It’s not

610
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:15.906
going to have a big impact on this
generation. It’s notjust about exam

611
00:22:15.906 --> 00:22:16.156
generation. It’s not just about exam
results

612
00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:17.615
generation. It’s notjust about exam
results and life chances, as

613
00:22:17.615 --> 00:22:19.198
results and life chances, as
important as that is, but health

614
00:22:19.198 --> 00:22:19.740
important as that is, but health
professionals are increasingly

615
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.531
professionals are increasingly
worried this is having a real impact

616
00:22:22.531 --> 00:22:25.156
worried this is having a real impact
on children’s mental health as well.

617
00:22:25.156 --> 00:22:27.990
on children’s mental health as well.
So we ought to be trying to get

618
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.615
So we ought to be trying to get
children back to school as quickly

619
00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:31.573
children back to school as quickly
as can safely be achieved. It is why

620
00:22:31.573 --> 00:22:32.115
as ran safely be achieved. It is why
it has

621
00:22:32.115 --> 00:22:33.906
as can safely be achieved. It is why
it has been so frustrating to see

622
00:22:33.906 --> 00:22:36.198
it has been so frustrating to see
the Government’s response to this,

623
00:22:36.198 --> 00:22:38.406
the Government’s response to this,
entering into this blame game and

624
00:22:38.406 --> 00:22:40.990
entering into this blame game and
refusing to work with people to

625
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.365
refusing to work with peopla to
build a

626
00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:42.198
refusing to work with people to
build a national consensus around

627
00:22:42.198 --> 00:22:44.990
build a national consensus around
this. I think we could sort this out

628
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.740
this. I think we could sort this out
pretty quickly, actually. It is a

629
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.823
pretty quickly, actually. It is a
huge effort and it takes a lot of

630
00:22:48.823 --> 00:22:50.615
huge effort and it takes a lot of
work to get children back to school

631
00:22:50.615 --> 00:22:51.156
work to get children back to school
safely

632
00:22:51.156 --> 00:22:52.115
work to get children hack to school
safely with

633
00:22:52.115 --> 00:22:52.906
work to get children back to school
safely with the social distancing

634
00:22:52.906 --> 00:22:54.323
safely with the social distancing
requirements, but if you think back

635
00:22:54.323 --> 00:22:56.281
requirements, but if you think back
to when we were trying to get the

636
00:22:56.281 --> 00:22:56.406
to when we were trying to get the
pub“:

637
00:22:56.406 --> 00:22:58.698
to when we were trying to get the
public health efforts of the ground

638
00:22:58.698 --> 00:22:59.906
public health efforts of the ground
and the Government did conceive they

639
00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.865
and the Government did conceive they
needed to work with a wide variety

640
00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:04.240
needed to work with a wide variety
of partners, the army was brought in

641
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.156
of partners, the army was brought in
to help construct hospitals, we had

642
00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:06.740
to help construct hospitals, we had
peopla being

643
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.323
to help construct hospitals, we had
people being brought back out of

644
00:23:08.323 --> 00:23:10.115
people being brought back out of
retirement in order to help boost

645
00:23:10.115 --> 00:23:12.740
retirement in order to help boost
the workforce, and we need a

646
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.323
the workforce, and we need a
comparable effort for education. We

647
00:23:15.323 --> 00:23:16.906
comparable effort for education. We
had efforts around health, we’ve had

648
00:23:16.906 --> 00:23:19.740
had efforts around health, we’ve had
efforts around the economy, but

649
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.281
efforts around the economy, but
education has really been the poor

650
00:23:22.281 --> 00:23:24.115
education has really been the poor

confusing? The Shadow Education
Secretary Rebecca Long—Bailey said

657
00:23:31.698 --> 00:23:32.323
Secretary Rebeca Long-Bailay said
only last

658
00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:33.531
Secretary Rebecca Long—Bailey said
only last week it was welcome that

659
00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:35.865
only last week it was welcome that
the Government was rolling back from

660
00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:37.823
the Government was rolling back from
full school reopening plans before

661
00:23:37.823 --> 00:23:40.156
full school reopening plans before
summer. It is welcome that they are

662
00:23:40.156 --> 00:23:41.281
summer. It is welcome that they are
not trying to force schools to

663
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:43.698
not trying to force schools to
reopen when it is not safe to do so,

664
00:23:43.698 --> 00:23:48.656
reopen when it is not safe to do so,
and actually this is five months ago

665
00:23:48.656 --> 00:23:51.615
and actually this is five months ago
we were calling for the Government

666
00:23:51.615 --> 00:23:52.031
we were falling for the Government
to have

667
00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:52.781
we were calling for the Government
to have an exit strategy from

668
00:23:52.781 --> 00:23:53.990
to have an exit strategy from
lockdown, to start working on that

669
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.156
lockdown, to start working on that
now, because the countries that have

670
00:23:55.156 --> 00:23:56.365
now, because the countries that have
managed to get children back to

671
00:23:56.365 --> 00:23:57.365
managed to get children back to
school more quickly were planning

672
00:23:57.365 --> 00:23:58.573
school more quickly were planning
for this several months ago. They

673
00:23:58.573 --> 00:24:00.406
for this several months ago. They
have also done a lot more to try and

674
00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.573
have also done a lot more to try and
get support to children in the

675
00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:02.948
get support to children in the
meantime so when children do go back

676
00:24:02.948 --> 00:24:04.698
meantime so when children do go back
to school we are not dealing with

677
00:24:04.698 --> 00:24:06.323
to school we are not dealing with
this enormous attainment gap. The

678
00:24:06.323 --> 00:24:07.698
this enormous attainment gap. The
Government promised laptops and

679
00:24:07.698 --> 00:24:09.281
Government promised laptops and
intranet connections months ago but

680
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.031
intranet connections months ago but
we are just still not seeing them

681
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:12.781
we are just still not seeing them
delivered around the country, we had

682
00:24:12.781 --> 00:24:15.323
delivered around the country, we had
a plan announced today that said

683
00:24:15.323 --> 00:24:16.698
a plan announced today that said
they would be private tutoring

684
00:24:16.698 --> 00:24:19.448
they would be private tutoring
available. I really welcome this,

685
00:24:19.448 --> 00:24:20.948
available. I really welcome this,
but once again school leader limit

686
00:24:20.948 --> 00:24:22.365
but once again school leader limit
have been left wringing their hands

687
00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:25.031
have been left wringing their hands
saying, why haven’t you spoken to us

688
00:24:25.031 --> 00:24:27.156
saying, why haven’t you spoken to us
before you announce these? We have

689
00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:29.823
before you announce these? We have
had enough of back of the envelope

690
00:24:29.823 --> 00:24:31.240
had enough of back of the envelope
plans, we need a proper national

691
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240
plans, we need a proper national
strategy and national consensus and

692
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.615
strategy and national consensus and
we need the Government to reach out

693
00:24:33.615 --> 00:24:35.740
we need the Government to reach out
and work with schools in order to

694
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.406
and work with schools in order to
get our children back to school as

695
00:24:37.406 --> 00:24:38.823
get our children back to school as
quickly as possible. Steve, there

696
00:24:38.823 --> 00:24:40.990
quickly as possible. Steve, there
seems to be an element of some

697
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.115
seems to be an element of some
schools planning their own furrow.

698
00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:44.531
schools planning their own furrow.
Private schools saying they are

699
00:24:44.531 --> 00:24:46.240
Private schools saying they are
going to get their own kind of apt

700
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.906
going to get their own kind of apt
going, that they are committed to

701
00:24:47.906 --> 00:24:50.156
going, that they are committed to
getting all children back in school

702
00:24:50.156 --> 00:24:52.281
getting all children back in school
by September. Look, I would agree

703
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:54.448
by September. Look, I would agree
with Lisa on a lot of things. We

704
00:24:54.448 --> 00:24:58.115
with Lisa on a lot of things. We
don’t seem to have a strategy to

705
00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:01.198
don’t seem to have a strategy to
exit the in any industry. You know,

706
00:25:01.198 --> 00:25:02.740
exit the in any industry. You know,
fortunately, in football we had the

707
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.990
fortunately, in football we had the
resources and the money to develop

708
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.031
resources and the money to develop
our own strategy, and we can test

709
00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:07.281
our own strategy, and we ran test
players twice a

710
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:08.531
our own strategy, and we can test
players twice a week, and we have a

711
00:25:08.531 --> 00:25:09.948
players twice a week, and we have a
fairty limited

712
00:25:09.948 --> 00:25:10.531
players twice a week, and we have a
fairly limited requirement without

713
00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:14.115
fairty limited requirement without
supporters.

714
00:25:14.115 --> 00:25:15.115
fairly limited requirement without
supporters. This virus most likely

715
00:25:15.115 --> 00:25:17.531
supporters. This virus most likely
will stay with us in disguise for

716
00:25:17.531 --> 00:25:19.281
will stay with us in disguise for
the foreseeable future. We all hope

717
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:21.531
the foreseeable future. We all hope
for a vaccine, we hope for better

718
00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:22.781
for a vaccine, we hope for better
interventions, but we know they are

719
00:25:22.781 --> 00:25:24.823
interventions, but we know they are
not likely to come. If the lockdown

720
00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:26.365
not likely to come. If the lockdown
worked, which we all think it did,

721
00:25:26.365 --> 00:25:28.740
worked, which we all think it did,
when we come out of lockdown

722
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.990
when we come out of lockdown
infections will rise. And if we

723
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.990
infections will rise. And if we
can’t track those infections and

724
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.656
ran’t track those infections and
trace

725
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:33.573
can’t track those infections and
trace them and quell those

726
00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:36.031
trace them and quell those
outbreaks, we really are in for a

727
00:25:36.031 --> 00:25:37.240
outbreaks, we really are in for a
terrible time economically, and

728
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.448
terrible time economically, and
coming back to the original question

729
00:25:39.448 --> 00:25:41.448
coming back to the original question
I would say there will be limited

730
00:25:41.448 --> 00:25:43.823
I would say there will be limited
damage done to everything if we can

731
00:25:43.823 --> 00:25:45.323
damage done to everything if we ran
get back to as

732
00:25:45.323 --> 00:25:46.656
damage done to everything if we can
get back to as close to normal as

733
00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:46.990
get back to as close to normal as
possibla by

734
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.323
get back to as close to normal as
possible by September. But if we

735
00:25:48.323 --> 00:25:49.990
possible by September. But if we
don’t get back to as close to normal

736
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.531
don’t get back to as close to normal
as possibla by

737
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:52.115
don’t get back to as close to normal
as possible by September or

738
00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:54.031
as possible by September or
children, businesses, children’s

739
00:25:54.031 --> 00:25:56.531
children, businesses, children’s
future will be damaged for maybe

740
00:25:56.531 --> 00:25:57.656
future will be damaged for maybe
10-15 years.

741
00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.531
future will be damaged for maybe
10—15 years. So the next 2—3 months

742
00:25:59.531 --> 00:26:00.615
10-15 years. So the next 2-3 months
are such a

743
00:26:00.615 --> 00:26:01.531
10—15 years. So the next 2—3 months
are such a crucial period. It does

744
00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:03.906
are such a crucial period. It does
require everybody to stop the blame

745
00:26:03.906 --> 00:26:07.448
require everybody to stop the blame
game. It requires a massive, massive

746
00:26:07.448 --> 00:26:09.281
game. It requires a massive, massive
national effort, and a can—do

747
00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:09.365
national effort, and a ran-do
mentality

748
00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:10.240
national effort, and a can—do
mentality and attitude that it

749
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240
mentality and attitude that it
worries me that we seem to have lost

750
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.031
worries me that we seem to have lost
in this country. If we don’t do

751
00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:15.990
in this country. If we don’t do
that, we really are in serious

752
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.448
that, we really are in serious
problems. White might look, you

753
00:26:17.448 --> 00:26:17.865
probloms. white might look, you
mention,

754
00:26:17.865 --> 00:26:20.531
problems. White might look, you
mention, and you mention as well,

755
00:26:20.531 --> 00:26:21.365
mention, and you mention as well,
jed, in terms of

756
00:26:21.365 --> 00:26:22.073
mention, and you mention as well,
Jed, in terms of contact tracing and

757
00:26:22.073 --> 00:26:22.865
jed, in terms of contact tracing and
that moving us

758
00:26:22.865 --> 00:26:24.073
Jed, in terms of contact tracing and
that moving us forward, we have a

759
00:26:24.073 --> 00:26:27.323
that moving us forward, we have a
question on that, so let’s come to

760
00:26:27.323 --> 00:26:31.448
question on that, so let’s come to
Gareth jones.

761
00:26:31.448 --> 00:26:33.115
The current APP development
is experiencing problems,

762
00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:36.073
if we don’t get it working does it
really matter, will it

763
00:26:36.073 --> 00:26:39.115
make a difference to
preventing a second wave?

764
00:26:39.115 --> 00:26:41.365
Does it really matter, Lisa Nandy? I

765
00:26:41.365 --> 00:26:42.031
Does it really matter, Lisa Mandy? I
think it

766
00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:45.823
Does it really matter, Lisa Nandy? I
think it does matter and I very much

767
00:26:45.823 --> 00:26:47.406
think it does matter and I very much
support the Government in trying to

768
00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:48.906
support the Government in trying to
set this up because in the end if

769
00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:50.490
set this up because in the end if
you get the app up and running it

770
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:50.990
you get the app up and mnning it
will save

771
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.865
you get the app up and running it
will save lives, but the problem was

772
00:26:52.865 --> 00:26:54.073
will save lives, but the problem was
the Government was one from the

773
00:26:54.073 --> 00:26:55.406
the Government was one from the
outset the path they were taking was

774
00:26:55.406 --> 00:26:56.990
outset the path they were taking was
not going to work because the

775
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.115
not going to work because the
technology just wasn’t compatible

776
00:26:58.115 --> 00:27:00.865
technology just wasn’t compatible
with a lot of phones. There were

777
00:27:00.865 --> 00:27:03.365
with a lot of phones. There were
other countries, like Germany and

778
00:27:03.365 --> 00:27:05.656
other countries, like Germany and
Australia, who were taking a similar

779
00:27:05.656 --> 00:27:07.948
Australia, who were taking a similar
path to our Government, trying to

780
00:27:07.948 --> 00:27:08.781
path to our Government, trying to
develop their own technology,

781
00:27:08.781 --> 00:27:10.656
develop their own technology,
realised it wouldn’t work, listen to

782
00:27:10.656 --> 00:27:12.240
realised it wouldn’t work, listen to
those warnings, and actually went

783
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.281
those warnings, and actually went
down a different path. As a result,

784
00:27:15.281 --> 00:27:17.656
down a different path. As a result,
Germany has just managed to launch

785
00:27:17.656 --> 00:27:19.073
Germany has just managed to launch
their app yesterday and they are

786
00:27:19.073 --> 00:27:20.740
their app yesterday and they are
quite confident about how it will

787
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.573
quite confident about how it will
work. So we really have to start

788
00:27:24.573 --> 00:27:27.198
work. So we really have to start
breaking the pattern here which is a

789
00:27:27.198 --> 00:27:28.281
breaking the pattern here which is a
Government that shuts people out,

790
00:27:28.281 --> 00:27:28.531
Government that shuts peopla out,
doesn’t

791
00:27:28.531 --> 00:27:29.781
Government that shuts people out,
doesn’t listen to advice, doesn’t

792
00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:32.365
doesn’t listen to advice, doesn’t
seek to learn from expertise here in

793
00:27:32.365 --> 00:27:34.115
seek to learn from expertise here in
the UK and overseas. And then find

794
00:27:34.115 --> 00:27:36.073
the UK and overseas. And then find
later that they have to revisit

795
00:27:36.073 --> 00:27:37.823
later that they have to revisit
those plans because they have

796
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.323
those plans because they have
unravelled very quickly. We saw it

797
00:27:39.323 --> 00:27:39.823
unravellad very quickly. We saw it
over and

798
00:27:39.823 --> 00:27:40.906
unravelled very quickly. We saw it
over and over again with a whole

799
00:27:40.906 --> 00:27:42.198
over and over again with a whola
host of things.

800
00:27:42.198 --> 00:27:43.156
over and over again with a whole
host of things. One of the real

801
00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:44.531
host of things. One of the real
outstanding problems with all of

802
00:27:44.531 --> 00:27:44.906
outstanding problams with all of
this at

803
00:27:44.906 --> 00:27:46.990
outstanding problems with all of
this at the moment is you have

804
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.156
this at the moment is you have
pub“:

805
00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:49.156
this at the moment is you have
public health directors across

806
00:27:49.156 --> 00:27:51.281
public health directors across
England saying that they still don’t

807
00:27:51.281 --> 00:27:53.323
England saying that they still don’t
get. . .

808
00:27:53.323 --> 00:27:55.406
England saying that they still don’t
get... The GPs in local areas don’t

809
00:27:55.406 --> 00:27:56.115
get... The GPs in [oral areas don’t
get the results of

810
00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:56.990
get... The GPs in local areas don’t
get the results of tests because the

811
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.573
get the results of tests because the
Government set up their own private

812
00:27:58.573 --> 00:28:00.781
Government set up their own private
sector testing facilities around the

813
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:02.865
sector testing facilities around the
country, so GPs simply don’t know

814
00:28:02.865 --> 00:28:05.156
country, so GPs simply don’t know
when their patients are testing

815
00:28:05.156 --> 00:28:06.823
when their patients are testing
positive for Covid. Public health

816
00:28:06.823 --> 00:28:08.115
positive for Covid. Public health
directors are looking closely at

817
00:28:08.115 --> 00:28:08.406
directors are looking closely at
[oral

818
00:28:08.406 --> 00:28:10.031
directors are looking closely at
local outbreaks and having to make

819
00:28:10.031 --> 00:28:11.406
local outbreaks and having to make
decisions about managing local

820
00:28:11.406 --> 00:28:13.406
decisions about managing local
outbreaks, but because they are not

821
00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:14.156
outbreaks, but because they are not
getting that information they

822
00:28:14.156 --> 00:28:14.448
outbreaks, but because they are not
getting that information theyjust

823
00:28:14.448 --> 00:28:14.656
getting that information they just
simply

824
00:28:14.656 --> 00:28:15.573
getting that information theyjust
simply don’t have the tools they

825
00:28:15.573 --> 00:28:18.115
simply don’t have the tools they
need to do the job, so we need a

826
00:28:18.115 --> 00:28:19.865
need to do the job, so we need a
reset here. It is right for the

827
00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:21.073
reset here. It is right for the
Government to abandon the system if

828
00:28:21.073 --> 00:28:23.115
Government to abandon the system if
it isn’t working but we need to ask

829
00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:25.656
it isn’t working but we need to ask
ourselves, why is it so often that

830
00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:27.323
ourselves, why is it so often that
we end up having to unravel plans

831
00:28:27.323 --> 00:28:30.073
we end up having to unravel plans
over and over again because we

832
00:28:30.073 --> 00:28:31.531
over and over again because we
didn’t get them right in the first

833
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:32.323
didn’t get them right in the first
place? Steve, I

834
00:28:32.323 --> 00:28:32.615
didn’t get them right in the first
place? Steve, Iwant

835
00:28:32.615 --> 00:28:33.406
didn’t get them right in the first
place? Steve, I want to ask you not

836
00:28:33.406 --> 00:28:35.281
place? Steve, I want to ask you not
only what you think about this

837
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:36.656
only what you think about this
particular question, but also just

838
00:28:36.656 --> 00:28:38.781
particular question, but also just
tell us a little about how you’re

839
00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:40.031
tell us a little about how you’re
managing at Crystal Palace, because

840
00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:43.031
managing at Crystal Palace, because
you have a kind of app of your own

841
00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:46.073
you have a kind of app of your own
there? Yes, it’s not a tracing app.

842
00:28:46.073 --> 00:28:47.490
there? Yes, it’s not a tracing app.
On the app, it seems incredible to

843
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:50.156
On the app, it seems incredible to
me so many countries are developing

844
00:28:50.156 --> 00:28:55.115
me so many countries are developing
their own I would have thought...

845
00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:58.031
..certainly if the EU has a purpose
that might be one thing

846
00:28:58.031 --> 00:28:59.948
that they could’ve got everyone’s
heads together on.

847
00:28:59.948 --> 00:29:02.781
We all want exactly the same app
doing exactly the same thing,

848
00:29:02.781 --> 00:29:03.865
which seems incredible.

849
00:29:03.865 --> 00:29:06.740
We have a very simple app
where the players and the staff

850
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.115
fill in any symptoms,
because that’s as efficient a way

851
00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:10.323
of catching the disease early.

852
00:29:10.323 --> 00:29:12.740
Sometimes there is testing
where there can be a lag

853
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.656
between the time you test
and testing positive.

854
00:29:14.656 --> 00:29:16.823
But, you know, developing these apps
is extremely complex.

855
00:29:16.823 --> 00:29:19.740
As somebody who had a business that
developed this kind of thing,

856
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.531
the timescales that we are trying
to do it in are very,

857
00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:25.656
very compressed.

858
00:29:25.656 --> 00:29:27.823
And I’m pleased today that
they’re adapting to Google

859
00:29:27.823 --> 00:29:30.948
and Apple technology which,
you know — I would hazard a guess —

860
00:29:30.948 --> 00:29:32.865
they might be better
at producing stuff than,

861
00:29:32.865 --> 00:29:34.281
you know, people in our Government.

862
00:29:34.281 --> 00:29:36.698
So, look, let’s hope
that we can all get together.

863
00:29:36.698 --> 00:29:39.823
The blame game on both sides I think
really does need to stop.

864
00:29:39.823 --> 00:29:42.490
It’s a very difficult situation.

865
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.948
Nobody was prepared
for the situation.

866
00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:46.823
But, you know, we can see Germany
have done slightly less worse

867
00:29:46.823 --> 00:29:47.865
than everybody else.

868
00:29:47.865 --> 00:29:51.698
We’ll need to look back...

869
00:29:51.698 --> 00:29:54.365
They’ve done a lot better in terms
of their death toll.

870
00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:56.531
They have done in terms
of their death toll,

871
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:59.865
but I think when we look back
on this 10,000 deaths is too many.

872
00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:02.990
You know, for this to get
to the extent that it did come

873
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:06.115
into the amount of countries that it
has, you know, the world really

874
00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:09.198
needs to look at it and make sure
that these kind of outbreaks

875
00:30:09.198 --> 00:30:12.365
are jumped on way before the kind
of things we are discussing now.

876
00:30:12.365 --> 00:30:14.990
Because we are talking now
a pandemic that is broadly out

877
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.365
of control in the world
that we are trying to get on top of,

878
00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:20.240
and it is going to be
extremely difficult.

879
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.115
And we do need to come together,
as a country, private interface,

880
00:30:23.115 --> 00:30:25.781
the Government, both sides
of the House, and try and find

881
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:27.948
a solution in the next
two or three months,

882
00:30:27.948 --> 00:30:30.115
or we really could be
in a terrible situation.

883
00:30:30.115 --> 00:30:36.115
Mike, you’ve had your
hand up from the start.

884
00:30:36.115 --> 00:30:39.073
Yes, I was going to say,
with Apple and Google, there’s good

885
00:30:39.073 --> 00:30:40.990
parts in both applications.

886
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.365
Surely these companies could come
togetherfor once, you know,

887
00:30:44.365 --> 00:30:46.781
because there’s a big pandemic on,
and sort of resource...

888
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:47.948
Put their resources together.

889
00:30:47.948 --> 00:30:51.115
Well, I think they are putting
their resources together

890
00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:53.781
for the benefits of this particular
app, as I understand it.

891
00:30:53.781 --> 00:30:56.365
Charles 7

892
00:30:56.365 --> 00:30:58.323
Yes.

893
00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:01.448
It just seems that this is just
another moment of Government bluster

894
00:31:01.448 --> 00:31:03.448
actually hitting reality.

895
00:31:03.448 --> 00:31:06.365
50 Matt Hancock and Baroness Harding
said today that they backed both

896
00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:10.323
horses of the Google and the android
model and the NHS app,

897
00:31:10.323 --> 00:31:12.990
but they’ve always insisted
until this point that they were only

898
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.406
going to pursue the NHS app.

899
00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:17.823
So itjust seems that the Government
are trying to make it seem that

900
00:31:17.823 --> 00:31:20.406
they’re trying to do the job
possible but when it comes

901
00:31:20.406 --> 00:31:23.281
to reality they want to cover up
and not pretend that they’ve

902
00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:26.656
done anything wrong.

903
00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:30.906
Jed?

904
00:31:30.906 --> 00:31:33.781
Well, I think that the app can only
really be an adjunct.

905
00:31:33.781 --> 00:31:36.406
I think there are technological
limitations in the app in terms

906
00:31:36.406 --> 00:31:39.156
of providing a nationwide service.

907
00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:42.906
And, really, it’s about having
a functioning public health

908
00:31:42.906 --> 00:31:47.490
infrastructure that is able to deal
with outbreaks locally,

909
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:51.990
and unfortunately the Government has
chosen to centralise and use

910
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.490
a private company, Serco,
to take the lead on this.

911
00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.115
And I think that a lot of public
health officials and workers,

912
00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:04.115
as Lisa said, are frustrated
that they are not receiving

913
00:32:04.115 --> 00:32:06.573
the information — they’ve
kind of been shutout,

914
00:32:06.573 --> 00:32:08.948
whether intentionally
or not, I don’t know.

915
00:32:08.948 --> 00:32:11.490
But they do feel that
they’ve been shutout,

916
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.073
and that it does, then,
limit is in terms of our

917
00:32:14.073 --> 00:32:19.115
ability to do exactly
what we are all asking for.

918
00:32:25.323 --> 00:32:27.490
As Steve said, where
is that can do attitude?

919
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.615
Can we crush this virus so that
society can get back to normal

920
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.240
and our kids can get back
into school and their businesses

921
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.406
can get up and running?

922
00:32:34.406 --> 00:32:37.115
And a lot of the businesses
and the particular sectors that

923
00:32:37.115 --> 00:32:39.490
are looking to get back frankly
don’t have much confidence.

924
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.698
And what about your business?

925
00:32:40.698 --> 00:32:44.031
I mean, getting Line Of Duty —
I see that as an unashamed fan,

926
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:46.698
I have to confess —
getting that back up and running?

927
00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:49.115
Well, it is interesting that
you give that specific example

928
00:32:49.115 --> 00:32:52.615
because we had an outbreak
during the shoot, over in Belfast,

929
00:32:52.615 --> 00:32:55.365
when there was the test
and trace system originally,

930
00:32:55.365 --> 00:32:56.490
the containment phase.

931
00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.740
And we were able to deal
with that, and we were able

932
00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.323
to carry on uninterrupted.

933
00:33:01.323 --> 00:33:05.698
Then, towards the end
of the shoot that got curtailed,

934
00:33:05.698 --> 00:33:09.281
we had another outbreak
and I was quite surprised to learn

935
00:33:09.281 --> 00:33:12.198
that we weren’t able to do
testing and tracing,

936
00:33:12.198 --> 00:33:14.073
the system had been stopped.

937
00:33:14.073 --> 00:33:17.490
And that was the point where,
really, when we looked at it,

938
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.656
we knew that we couldn’t
protect our workforce

939
00:33:20.656 --> 00:33:21.865
and we had to stop.

940
00:33:21.865 --> 00:33:24.073
And that was nine days
before the lockdown.

941
00:33:24.073 --> 00:33:28.365
So the writing was on the well then,
and I think a lot of businesses

942
00:33:28.365 --> 00:33:30.531
are just going to take
responsibility for it themselves.

943
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:35.448
I think that each TV production
will organise their own testing

944
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:40.115
and they will look after each other
and do their best that way.

945
00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:42.073
And, James, obviously we had
the announcement today

946
00:33:42.073 --> 00:33:45.073
from the Health Secretary
about switching horses, I think,

947
00:33:45.073 --> 00:33:49.448
was the analogy Matt Hancock used.

948
00:33:49.448 --> 00:33:54.490
But he also said, "We backed both
horses throughout" —

949
00:33:57.198 --> 00:34:00.281
the NHSX app and also this other
app, kind of Google Apple app.

950
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:02.948
What I don’t understand
about that is if the Government has

951
00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:05.406
been backing both those things,
it’s nowjettisoned one —

952
00:34:05.406 --> 00:34:08.906
why isn’t the other one ready?

953
00:34:08.906 --> 00:34:13.906
Well, I mean, these
apps, we talk about...

954
00:34:14.406 --> 00:34:18.323
I mean, Lisa implies
there was an obvious right answer.

955
00:34:18.323 --> 00:34:20.115
There clearly wasn’t
an obvious right answer...

956
00:34:20.115 --> 00:34:22.948
But if you’ve been backing them both
and other countries are already

957
00:34:22.948 --> 00:34:26.740
introducing their own apps,
how come the other one isn’t ready?

958
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.615
So the idea that there was
an obvious right answer is wrong,

959
00:34:29.615 --> 00:34:32.490
otherwise every country in the world
would have done the same thing.

960
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.656
That’s not what happened —
Germany as an example.

961
00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:37.573
And what Matt did was exactly
the right thing to do,

962
00:34:37.573 --> 00:34:40.948
which is not to put all our eggs
in one basket, to make sure

963
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:44.781
that we were developing, you know,
the in—house app as it

964
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:49.823
were and the app
through third parties.

965
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.698
So how ready is this app, then?

966
00:34:51.698 --> 00:34:55.073
And it was tested on the Isle
of Wight and the decision was made

967
00:34:55.073 --> 00:34:58.948
to go with the other option,
and that’s the right thing to do,

968
00:34:58.948 --> 00:35:01.115
and it’s about learning
as we go through this

969
00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:03.073
and making the decision.

970
00:35:03.073 --> 00:35:07.865
I don’t know exactly
when the app will go live.

971
00:35:07.865 --> 00:35:10.948
Because we heard it
might not be till winter.

972
00:35:10.948 --> 00:35:14.531
So, as I say, I don’t
want to guess and speculate.

973
00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:16.990
I don’t know exactly
when the app will go live,

974
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.865
but obviously we will continue
working with international

975
00:35:18.865 --> 00:35:21.740
friends and partners,
we will learn from what other

976
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.490
countries are doing, and the whole
world is learning as we go,

977
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:30.448
to make sure that we bring
about a test and trace app that can

978
00:35:30.448 --> 00:35:34.490
be used to protect us all.

979
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.865
Gareth?

980
00:35:35.865 --> 00:35:40.865
Yeah.

981
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:47.781
Do you not think that the public
are going to see this

982
00:35:47.781 --> 00:35:50.448
as another U—turn again,
and it’s going to be even harder

983
00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:53.573
to get the public on board
to actually use the app when it

984
00:35:53.573 --> 00:35:54.656
does become live?

985
00:35:54.656 --> 00:35:57.031
And do you worry about that,
loss of public confidence?

986
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:58.115
No, because, I mean...

987
00:35:58.115 --> 00:36:00.198
Which is critical, obviously,
if it’s going to work.

988
00:36:00.198 --> 00:36:01.406
We use the word U—turn.

989
00:36:01.406 --> 00:36:04.073
I mean, I was in business before
I came into politics,

990
00:36:04.073 --> 00:36:07.406
and if you’re going to test a couple
of options, see which one progresses

991
00:36:07.406 --> 00:36:10.281
best, see which one works,
and then invest your time and effort

992
00:36:10.281 --> 00:36:12.198
in the better performing
one of those options,

993
00:36:12.198 --> 00:36:13.240
that’s not a U—turn.

994
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.656
That’s why it was tested
on the Isle of Wight...

995
00:36:15.656 --> 00:36:16.740
0K.

996
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.865
That’s why, you know,
we learn from their experiences.

997
00:36:18.865 --> 00:36:22.448
So you have been trialling the other
option on the Isle of Wight as well?

998
00:36:22.448 --> 00:36:23.490
Well, as...

999
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.531
No, but the point...

1000
00:36:24.531 --> 00:36:25.573
Oh, you haven’t?

1001
00:36:25.573 --> 00:36:27.031
The point that Matt was saying...

1002
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:29.656
No, hang on, Ijust want
to be clear, because now

1003
00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:30.698
I really don’t understand.

1004
00:36:30.698 --> 00:36:33.115
So if Matt Hancock said
you were backing both options,

1005
00:36:33.115 --> 00:36:35.740
and you are trialling the NHSX app,
presumably you are trialling

1006
00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.156
the other one as well, otherwise...

1007
00:36:37.156 --> 00:36:38.615
That’s what backing both options is.

1008
00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:39.656
No, that’s...

1009
00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:40.740
Isn’t it?

1010
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.073
So the test of our in—house app
was done on the Isle of Wight.

1011
00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:46.740
We were keeping our options open
for the use of either...

1012
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.365
So you haven’t trialled
the other one?

1013
00:36:48.365 --> 00:36:51.490
The other system is being used more
widely so doing a discreet UK

1014
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.906
only trialfor that one,
my understanding, and I’m willing

1015
00:36:53.906 --> 00:36:55.115
to be corrected on this...

1016
00:36:55.115 --> 00:36:57.740
So we haven’t tried it, but you’re
relying on other countries?

1017
00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.948
Because it’s being used elsewhere.

1018
00:36:58.948 --> 00:36:59.990
Right.

1019
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.115
So it’s not necessary
for us to trial both.

1020
00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:03.365
0K, I’ve got that clear.

1021
00:37:03.365 --> 00:37:06.198
The reason we were trialling
is to make sure that we chose

1022
00:37:06.198 --> 00:37:08.365
the best option because each option
had their advantages

1023
00:37:08.365 --> 00:37:09.406
and disadvantages.

1024
00:37:09.406 --> 00:37:12.531
It was not clear cut at the start
of this process that this

1025
00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:15.031
would be the better option.

1026
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:20.031
That’s why you test.

1027
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.740
Munira.

1028
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.115
I can’t overstate how important
getting test and trace right

1029
00:37:25.115 --> 00:37:27.240
and getting it right as quickly
as possible is.

1030
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.115
Everybody who is watching this
evening is desperate to try and get

1031
00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:31.573
back to some sense of normality.

1032
00:37:31.573 --> 00:37:35.406
Without a robust, operational test
and trace system it’s impossible

1033
00:37:35.406 --> 00:37:37.281
to be able to do that safely.

1034
00:37:37.281 --> 00:37:41.281
We have to be able to find
every case and isolate it

1035
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:45.365
and suppress this virus.

1036
00:37:45.365 --> 00:37:48.615
What is very clear to me
is when I had a conversation with

1037
00:37:48.615 --> 00:37:52.615
the Deputy Chief Medical Officer
on the 13th of March it was around

1038
00:37:52.615 --> 00:37:57.656
then that we stopped routinely
testing and tracing every incidence

1039
00:37:59.115 --> 00:38:02.865
of coronavirus, and I questioned
her hard, and I said,

1040
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.490
"Why are you stopping the testing?

1041
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.531
We should be testing every case."

1042
00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:09.115
And it was down to capacity.

1043
00:38:09.115 --> 00:38:10.740
And it had been far too late.

1044
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.615
It was some weeks after that
that we suddenly saw a focus

1045
00:38:13.615 --> 00:38:14.656
on ramping up testing.

1046
00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:16.115
And, great, we’ve got the capacity.

1047
00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:18.990
But, James, we haven’t had
for almost a month now the figures

1048
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:22.490
on how many people have actually
been tested, on a daily basis,

1049
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:26.615
and on tracing, as Lisa has said,
we need to be working much more

1050
00:38:26.615 --> 00:38:29.490
closely with local authorities.

1051
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.865
Directors of public health have
been crying out to be

1052
00:38:31.865 --> 00:38:32.906
leading this effort.

1053
00:38:32.906 --> 00:38:34.781
They are the experts.

1054
00:38:34.781 --> 00:38:39.823
I didn’t watch the Salisbury
poisonings earlier this week,

1055
00:38:42.906 --> 00:38:45.948
but I heard in there it showed just
how pivotable the role

1056
00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:47.406
of the Director of public health is.

1057
00:38:47.406 --> 00:38:49.115
That is what they should be doing.

1058
00:38:49.115 --> 00:38:51.990
That’s what they are experts in,
and they should be leading those

1059
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.115
teams of contact tracers to be
tracing every case.

1060
00:38:54.115 --> 00:38:57.073
But last week I was talking to some
leaders in local Government,

1061
00:38:57.073 --> 00:39:00.198
and they haven’t got the data,
they haven’t got the tools.

1062
00:39:00.198 --> 00:39:02.115
They are still coming
to some extent, unclear

1063
00:39:02.115 --> 00:39:04.531
about what their role should be,
and this is absolutely

1064
00:39:04.531 --> 00:39:08.281
critical if we want to open
up our economy again.

1065
00:39:08.281 --> 00:39:11.365
I think it’s telling that you got
an honest answer about the reason

1066
00:39:11.365 --> 00:39:13.365
testing was abandoned in March.

1067
00:39:13.365 --> 00:39:17.115
What we were told, the public,
was told was that it wasn’t

1068
00:39:17.115 --> 00:39:20.198
appropriate for an economy
of our size.

1069
00:39:20.198 --> 00:39:23.865
Our institutions...

1070
00:39:23.865 --> 00:39:26.531
You know, we talk about
the Government all the time letting

1071
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:29.365
us down, but Public Health England
made that decision.

1072
00:39:29.365 --> 00:39:33.448
In Germany they devolved it very
quickly into the local authorities.

1073
00:39:33.448 --> 00:39:37.906
I would also say, I mean,
we can’t have the whole

1074
00:39:37.906 --> 00:39:40.115
of the United Kingdom hanging
on developing an app.

1075
00:39:40.115 --> 00:39:44.156
Test and trace is
possible to do manually.

1076
00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:47.281
Most of it, as you said, will happen
manually, even with the app.

1077
00:39:47.281 --> 00:39:49.948
The app is 15 minutes in proximity,
two metres, to somebody.

1078
00:39:49.948 --> 00:39:51.281
It’s just an adjunct.

1079
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:53.906
You can remember if you were with
somebody for 15 minutes.

1080
00:39:53.906 --> 00:39:55.031
Yeah.

1081
00:39:55.031 --> 00:39:58.531
You know, we need to get test
and trace rolled out manually,

1082
00:39:58.531 --> 00:40:01.698
and if the app comes along and helps
us do it then great,

1083
00:40:01.698 --> 00:40:03.281
but we can’t wait for that.

1084
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:06.656
But it’s also about people receiving
accurate information.

1085
00:40:06.656 --> 00:40:09.365
When you have public health
officials, when you have

1086
00:40:09.365 --> 00:40:12.365
Government scientists,
saying things which are manifestly

1087
00:40:12.365 --> 00:40:16.198
untrue, which is that it
wasn’t appropriate —

1088
00:40:16.198 --> 00:40:20.031
it was actually all about resources,
but they didn’t admit that.

1089
00:40:20.031 --> 00:40:23.615
And so now we are in a situation
again with the trust has broken

1090
00:40:23.615 --> 00:40:26.823
down, people are desperate to get
good quality information they can

1091
00:40:26.823 --> 00:40:30.573
rely on from their government,
from their public health officials,

1092
00:40:30.573 --> 00:40:33.865
so that people can make the right
decision to make the right

1093
00:40:33.865 --> 00:40:37.698
calculations about risk,
about how we get back to normal.

1094
00:40:37.698 --> 00:40:39.365
I think, Steve, you talked about...

1095
00:40:39.365 --> 00:40:42.281
Briefly, though, because Ijust
want to move on to another question.

1096
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:43.990
You talked about ending
the blame game.

1097
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.615
I think the public appreciate
that we are in an unprecedented

1098
00:40:46.615 --> 00:40:48.990
situation and know government
is going to get it right,

1099
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.656
but the thing that frustrates me
most about this government

1100
00:40:51.656 --> 00:40:54.531
is that theyjust don’t
have the humility to put their hands

1101
00:40:54.531 --> 00:40:57.073
up when they’ve actually
got it wrong.

1102
00:40:57.073 --> 00:40:59.865
When they do that they
say it’s a U—turn.

1103
00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:02.740
They are holding their hands up
and saying they got it wrong,

1104
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.281
and then they are told it’s
a U—turn, so that’s not

1105
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:07.531
an environment that’s conducive
to people making the right

1106
00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:08.823
decisions, is it?

1107
00:41:08.823 --> 00:41:11.240
That is the blame game,
that’s exactly what it is.

1108
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.698
No, but isn’t there a difference
between making a U—turn

1109
00:41:13.698 --> 00:41:14.906
on policy and just lying?

1110
00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:16.573
There’s a difference
between those two things.

1111
00:41:16.573 --> 00:41:18.323
Well, I certainly think...

1112
00:41:18.323 --> 00:41:20.781
I certainly think the information,
as you just pointed out,

1113
00:41:20.781 --> 00:41:22.698
that they’ve received from some
of our institutions

1114
00:41:22.698 --> 00:41:25.323
and scientists, and I’m not
here to defend them blindly —

1115
00:41:25.323 --> 00:41:26.365
everybody’s made terrible mistakes.

1116
00:41:26.365 --> 00:41:30.031
You know, where there was a left
turn to make we took the right one

1117
00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:32.615
on almost every occasion,
and we have to learn from it.

1118
00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:35.740
But I don’t think when we look back
there will be any one

1119
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.781
single reason, you know...

1120
00:41:36.781 --> 00:41:38.781
Oh, you’re absolutely right, Steve.

1121
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:42.115
And I think we have to consider that
when we move forward and that’s

1122
00:41:42.115 --> 00:41:44.031
the most important thing,
how we move forward.

1123
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:45.490
0K.

1124
00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.906
Moving forward involves learning
from your mistakes and being honest,

1125
00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:52.406
and unfortunately that gap
between the learning behaviour

1126
00:41:52.406 --> 00:41:56.781
and the transmission
of the information about what has

1127
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:59.406
been learned and where mistakes
were made, and I think that

1128
00:41:59.406 --> 00:42:04.281
that is problematic for people
to have confidence about

1129
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:06.448
the information they receive
and how they go forward.

1130
00:42:06.448 --> 00:42:09.073
OK, I’m going to move
on because we have another question

1131
00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:11.240
on a different topic
which I want to get

1132
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.281
in, from Laura Hill.

1133
00:42:12.281 --> 00:42:14.531
Earlier this week,
the Prime Minister announced

1134
00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:17.781
a review into racial inequality
in the country.

1135
00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:22.781
Isn’t now the time for action rather
than just another review?

1136
00:42:29.448 --> 00:42:30.490
Munira?

1137
00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.531
Absolutely.

1138
00:42:31.531 --> 00:42:33.698
Unfortunate that the announcement
was buried in a piece

1139
00:42:33.698 --> 00:42:34.698
about Winston Churchill’s statue.

1140
00:42:34.698 --> 00:42:36.573
People are angry,
people are hurting.

1141
00:42:36.573 --> 00:42:41.115
That’s why despite the fact that
we’ve got a public health emergency

1142
00:42:41.115 --> 00:42:44.406
and nobody wants to see crowds out
on the street people feel moved

1143
00:42:44.406 --> 00:42:47.073
to go out and protest,
having been outraged by what they’d

1144
00:42:47.073 --> 00:42:50.240
seen happen in the US
with George Floyd but also

1145
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.240
with the huge inequalities that have
been exposed by the virus.

1146
00:42:56.323 --> 00:42:58.031
We’ve seen the BAME communities
disproportionately affected.

1147
00:42:58.031 --> 00:43:03.073
Specifically what action do
you think should be taken?

1148
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.906
Well, there’s already been
a whole host of reviews

1149
00:43:08.906 --> 00:43:13.656
where the recommendations have yet
to be implemented, and in terms

1150
00:43:13.656 --> 00:43:16.781
of the Home Office ending
the hostile environment would be

1151
00:43:16.781 --> 00:43:20.115
a good place to start, for instance.

1152
00:43:20.115 --> 00:43:23.698
But there’s also things
like suspicionless stop and search.

1153
00:43:23.698 --> 00:43:27.031
We know that black individuals
are 47 times more likely to be

1154
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:30.948
stopped and searched,
and I received last week a letter

1155
00:43:30.948 --> 00:43:34.115
about a 15—year—old mixed race
boy in my constituency,

1156
00:43:34.115 --> 00:43:36.156
a law—abiding young man.

1157
00:43:36.156 --> 00:43:38.115
I heard from his headteacher.

1158
00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:42.656
And he has been stopped countless
times by the police.

1159
00:43:42.656 --> 00:43:44.365
They are convinced
its racial profiling.

1160
00:43:44.365 --> 00:43:47.281
When he’s out, even when he’s been
out with his white friends,

1161
00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:49.448
the police have stopped him
to question him, but

1162
00:43:49.448 --> 00:43:51.531
not his white friends.

1163
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:56.406
His parents are terrified that
at some point he’s going to get

1164
00:43:56.406 --> 00:43:59.073
into more trouble because he’s
going to react to being stopped.

1165
00:43:59.073 --> 00:44:00.948
This shouldn’t be happening.

1166
00:44:00.948 --> 00:44:05.948
And there are clearly systemic
issues that need to be tackled,

1167
00:44:06.115 --> 00:44:09.740
and that’s where, you know,
David Lammy’s review,

1168
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.906
we are still waiting for some
of those recommendations

1169
00:44:11.906 --> 00:44:12.990
to be implemented.

1170
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.365
So, yes, another review
is important, but it shouldn’tjust

1171
00:44:15.365 --> 00:44:16.448
be a research project.

1172
00:44:16.448 --> 00:44:19.656
It should be setting goals
and targets and measures for us

1173
00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:22.490
to be tracking progress against.

1174
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.573
I mean, Ijust had a little look
through the number of reviews

1175
00:44:25.573 --> 00:44:28.198
that there have been,
and by my counting anyway there have

1176
00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:31.573
been eight reviews in the last three
years looking into race

1177
00:44:31.573 --> 00:44:35.031
or the effect of race as part
of a bigger project.

1178
00:44:35.031 --> 00:44:37.281
Why do you need another one?

1179
00:44:37.281 --> 00:44:40.448
Well, reviews are how governments
learn about what needs

1180
00:44:40.448 --> 00:44:41.823
to change, what needs...

1181
00:44:41.823 --> 00:44:45.323
But most of these are your
government reviews and there have

1182
00:44:45.323 --> 00:44:48.698
been eight in the last three years.

1183
00:44:48.698 --> 00:44:50.365
Look, I am not going to...

1184
00:44:50.365 --> 00:44:53.990
I’m not going to suggest
that the Government should stop

1185
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.781
learning and stop understanding,
so I’m comfortable with reviews.

1186
00:44:57.781 --> 00:45:01.740
And, actually, I’m also very proud
of the fact that I’m part

1187
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.615
of the government that has made
some real differences.

1188
00:45:05.615 --> 00:45:09.615
So, for example, and I know these
figures will now be distorted

1189
00:45:09.615 --> 00:45:13.240
because of the situation
with the coronavirus,

1190
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.865
but up until that point the increase
in employment had disproportionately

1191
00:45:17.865 --> 00:45:22.531
benefited people from black
and other ethnic minority groups,

1192
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:26.198
and having a job I think
we would all agree is a foundation

1193
00:45:26.198 --> 00:45:28.490
stone for a better life.

1194
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.948
We have looked at the impact
of stop and search.

1195
00:45:30.948 --> 00:45:34.531
When I worked with BorisJohnson
when he was Mayor of London

1196
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:37.990
we looked at how crime
disproportionately affected black

1197
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.823
Londoners and he has carried that
passion now with him into Downing

1198
00:45:40.823 --> 00:45:44.906
Street.

1199
00:45:44.906 --> 00:45:47.823
And it’s easy when people say, oh,
we should do something, then

1200
00:45:47.823 --> 00:45:51.365
when asked what it is you should do
you are unable to give an answer,

1201
00:45:51.365 --> 00:45:54.490
because it is not simple
and it is not the kind of change

1202
00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:59.531
that can happen overnight,
but I’m incredibly proud of the work

1203
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:06.073
that the Prime Minister has done,
both as Prime Minister

1204
00:46:06.073 --> 00:46:08.656
and as Mayor of London,
to try and close the gap

1205
00:46:08.656 --> 00:46:13.198
between the lived experience
of ethnic minorities in the UK...

1206
00:46:13.198 --> 00:46:16.531
We’ve got lots of hands up here,
so let’s hear from some of them.

1207
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:17.573
Marsha?

1208
00:46:17.573 --> 00:46:19.406
Can I just say...

1209
00:46:19.406 --> 00:46:22.198
I think after you’ve mentioned
there have been eight reviews,

1210
00:46:22.198 --> 00:46:23.615
I think reviews aren’t enough.

1211
00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:28.656
It’s time now for reform.

1212
00:46:29.031 --> 00:46:31.656
And I think we should start at least
by educating children,

1213
00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:34.490
in school, about black culture
and black history.

1214
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:36.365
So that it can start there.

1215
00:46:36.365 --> 00:46:37.448
Ithink...

1216
00:46:37.448 --> 00:46:39.490
I mean, too many people...

1217
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.573
If you are saying a 15—year—old
was stopped several times

1218
00:46:41.573 --> 00:46:44.365
by the police and it was racial
profiling, that doesn’t come

1219
00:46:44.365 --> 00:46:47.948
from one specific police officer.

1220
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:58.698
That comes from the whole attitude
of people in general,

1221
00:46:58.698 --> 00:47:01.281
police officers in general,
and they didn’t go to the police

1222
00:47:01.281 --> 00:47:02.531
force with that attitude.

1223
00:47:02.531 --> 00:47:05.615
I think that came from the way
they were brought up or things

1224
00:47:05.615 --> 00:47:07.781
that they have learned,
you know, in their lives

1225
00:47:07.781 --> 00:47:10.031
as they’ve grown up.

1226
00:47:10.031 --> 00:47:13.615
I think if people had a different
attitude towards black

1227
00:47:13.615 --> 00:47:15.740
people as they grow up it
would start there.

1228
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.573
0K, lots of hands up.

1229
00:47:17.573 --> 00:47:20.656
I will try and get round
as many of you as I can,

1230
00:47:20.656 --> 00:47:25.698
so, reasonably briefly,
Anthony?

1231
00:47:27.115 --> 00:47:28.323
People don’t want another review.

1232
00:47:28.323 --> 00:47:29.531
They want to see change.

1233
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:30.948
That’s why they’re on the streets.

1234
00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:34.156
That’s why it’s brought them
out onto the streets.

1235
00:47:34.156 --> 00:47:39.115
Like you said, eight reviews —
and what has changed for them?

1236
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:42.906
All that I see is that there
is a large section of this nation

1237
00:47:42.906 --> 00:47:44.573
who are disenfranchised
with the whole scenario.

1238
00:47:44.573 --> 00:47:45.740
They want to see change.

1239
00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:50.156
And there are things
that can be done.

1240
00:47:50.156 --> 00:47:55.156
You know, we could teach
the children about black history

1241
00:47:55.615 --> 00:47:57.281
in school, they can
introduce culture, black

1242
00:47:57.281 --> 00:47:58.948
culture and ethnic culture
into the curriculum.

1243
00:47:58.948 --> 00:48:00.031
It’s their country.

1244
00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:03.948
People have got to be
made to feel like it’s

1245
00:48:03.948 --> 00:48:08.865
their country, but they’re not.

1246
00:48:08.865 --> 00:48:12.240
Sorry, I will come back to you,
James, forgive me — I will allow

1247
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.448
you to come back in.

1248
00:48:13.448 --> 00:48:14.448
Tony?

1249
00:48:14.448 --> 00:48:15.448
Yeah.

1250
00:48:15.448 --> 00:48:16.948
I’m afraid all this carries on.

1251
00:48:16.948 --> 00:48:21.906
I have a right to my
expression as well.

1252
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.406
And the black population
puts itself about —

1253
00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.115
The Black Lives Matter
movement is excellent,

1254
00:48:31.115 --> 00:48:34.406
but they do themselves no favours
when they riot in London.

1255
00:48:34.406 --> 00:48:37.115
There is plenty of government
legislation for racial equality.

1256
00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:39.698
The Government have done a lot
to try and make sure

1257
00:48:39.698 --> 00:48:44.740
that we have racial equality.

1258
00:48:45.073 --> 00:48:48.615
It’s the people that get it wrong,
and I’m afraid a lot of the time

1259
00:48:48.615 --> 00:48:51.281
the way that the Black Lives Matter
movement conducts itself does

1260
00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:56.240
them no good at all,
does them no favours.

1261
00:49:09.115 --> 00:49:11.740
Well, Tony, as I’m sure
as you know, there was violence

1262
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.573
but it was from a minority
of people, and there were huge

1263
00:49:14.573 --> 00:49:16.740
amounts of peaceful protests
on the streets as well.

1264
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.823
Belinda?

1265
00:49:17.823 --> 00:49:22.823
Just listening to what James has
been saying and also some

1266
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.615
of the other audience members,
you know, we do need to learn,

1267
00:49:28.615 --> 00:49:31.073
for all the points we’ve been
discussing this evening,

1268
00:49:31.073 --> 00:49:34.031
and like the audience member said,
it’s time for action.

1269
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:36.906
And just the previous comment then
shows a certain element of ignorance

1270
00:49:36.906 --> 00:49:41.906
about what is actually
happening right now.

1271
00:49:44.365 --> 00:49:46.198
As a teacher, you know,
our curriculum changed

1272
00:49:46.198 --> 00:49:50.406
and was reduced to become
English Heritage, and it’s not

1273
00:49:50.406 --> 00:49:52.573
just about black history
that we need to learn.

1274
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:57.573
It’s about our history,
our Anglo centric history,

1275
00:50:01.073 --> 00:50:04.115
warts and all, that needs to be
learned, and also needs to be

1276
00:50:04.115 --> 00:50:06.531
put into learning now,
so that we don’t have future

1277
00:50:06.531 --> 00:50:08.698
generations with similar attitudes
that willjust perpetuate this.

1278
00:50:08.698 --> 00:50:11.490
Sue?

1279
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.656
Stephen Lawrence was killed
before my son was born

1280
00:50:13.656 --> 00:50:14.698
and he’s graduated now.

1281
00:50:14.698 --> 00:50:19.448
The Macpherson report
of recommendations

1282
00:50:19.448 --> 00:50:24.490
were not put into place.

1283
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:38.115
Grenfell was another case
where we said, this has to be

1284
00:50:38.115 --> 00:50:39.823
a watershed and things
have to change.

1285
00:50:39.823 --> 00:50:41.990
We can go all the way
back to Windrush.

1286
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.948
Nothing is changing.

1287
00:50:52.323 --> 00:50:54.490
Review after review after review,
and we have peaceful

1288
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.656
Black Lives Matter demonstrations,
and it’s the white supremacists

1289
00:50:56.656 --> 00:50:59.240
who turn up, if you like,
who are causing the trouble

1290
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.323
at these demonstrations.

1291
00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:01.365
But it’s not individuals.

1292
00:51:01.365 --> 00:51:04.448
This is institutional and it goes
through the whole of the UK society.

1293
00:51:04.448 --> 00:51:07.615
through the whole of the UK society.

1294
00:51:07.615 --> 00:51:10.031
Steve, let me bring you back
to Laura’s original question.

1295
00:51:10.031 --> 00:51:12.615
Earlier this week the Prime Minister
announced a review into racial

1296
00:51:12.615 --> 00:51:13.698
inequality in the country.

1297
00:51:13.698 --> 00:51:16.573
Is it now the time for action rather
than just another review?

1298
00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.240
I absolutely think
it’s time for action.

1299
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.156
I mean, we have some
experience of this.

1300
00:51:20.156 --> 00:51:22.823
We have a big academy
with 212 boys in it at

1301
00:51:22.823 --> 00:51:25.948
any one time and, you know,
there are many, many facets of this

1302
00:51:25.948 --> 00:51:27.406
problem that we all accept exists.

1303
00:51:27.406 --> 00:51:29.781
One of the biggest ones
I see is really based

1304
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:32.156
around social mobility,
and the frustrating thing for me is

1305
00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:37.198
that we all have it in our power
to make a difference.

1306
00:51:39.865 --> 00:51:42.740
You know, again, this is one
of those things we can put

1307
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.656
to Government, or we
can make a change.

1308
00:51:44.656 --> 00:51:47.781
What I see in the boys we’ve got
is that they don’t have...

1309
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:49.490
Even if they are,
you know, academically

1310
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.115
strong and bright, they don’t
have the networks that we have.

1311
00:51:52.115 --> 00:51:53.573
They don’t get
the opportunities that

1312
00:51:53.573 --> 00:51:55.490
people in our network get.

1313
00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:00.490
And all of the people
that were involved in

1314
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.406
the protests, you know,
from the privilege side

1315
00:52:02.406 --> 00:52:05.073
of the debate, if you like,
can all make a difference.

1316
00:52:05.073 --> 00:52:07.198
They all run companies,
own companies, they can give

1317
00:52:07.198 --> 00:52:09.406
opportunities, whether it is work
experience, internships, to help

1318
00:52:09.406 --> 00:52:11.906
people along the road
on the journey.

1319
00:52:11.906 --> 00:52:13.823
And we can start making
a difference now.

1320
00:52:13.823 --> 00:52:15.490
We can all individually
start making a

1321
00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.448
difference tomorrow,
and we know we can.

1322
00:52:17.448 --> 00:52:21.740
And we don’t need to wait
for a Government review to do it.

1323
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.865
The Government review might help,
it might come up with things that we

1324
00:52:24.865 --> 00:52:27.031
can do with the police
and to change attitudes.

1325
00:52:27.031 --> 00:52:30.406
I certainly think, having looked
at this whole issue of

1326
00:52:30.406 --> 00:52:32.865
history and statues,
that we need to review some things.

1327
00:52:32.865 --> 00:52:35.448
You know, I think if we
wouldn’t put a statue up

1328
00:52:35.448 --> 00:52:39.115
of that person now, why
would we continue to have it?

1329
00:52:39.115 --> 00:52:41.781
Do we want a statue
to a man who brought 90,000

1330
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:43.948
slaves into the country
and killed 19,000 of them?

1331
00:52:43.948 --> 00:52:48.656
You know, not for me.

1332
00:52:48.656 --> 00:52:51.031
Whilst I think there are people
like Churchill, who although

1333
00:52:51.031 --> 00:52:53.656
misguided in some beliefs
at the time overall

1334
00:52:53.656 --> 00:52:56.573
were a force for good,
so I’d like to see real change.

1335
00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:59.740
I’d like to see us
grasp the moment that

1336
00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.115
we’ve got and have some kind of way
that we bring about more equality,

1337
00:53:03.115 --> 00:53:04.115
certainly in the workplace.

1338
00:53:04.115 --> 00:53:05.156
Jed?

1339
00:53:05.156 --> 00:53:08.365
I think Steve said so many
important things there,

1340
00:53:08.365 --> 00:53:12.531
and we’ve heard a lot of really
great points as well.

1341
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:17.115
I’d like to maybe bring
in a timely example,

1342
00:53:17.115 --> 00:53:22.156
because there was a recent review
which looked at the effects

1343
00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:26.115
of Covid, and one of the troubling
findings was about the vulnerability

1344
00:53:26.115 --> 00:53:28.031
of certain ethnicities to
coronavirus, specifically in terms

1345
00:53:28.031 --> 00:53:33.073
of front line health care staff.

1346
00:53:37.615 --> 00:53:40.490
And I certainly think that
an opportunity was missed to look at

1347
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:45.448
the risks that people
are experiencing based on their

1348
00:53:46.906 --> 00:53:49.281
ethnicity and whether there should
be redeployment of some staff,

1349
00:53:49.281 --> 00:53:51.448
whether there should be changes
in roles and that

1350
00:53:51.448 --> 00:53:56.490
should be factored in.

1351
00:53:57.823 --> 00:54:01.198
As someone who’s still got a lot
of friends who are in the medical

1352
00:54:01.198 --> 00:54:06.156
profession, some of whom are in
those particularly vulnerable

1353
00:54:06.698 --> 00:54:11.656
groups, I do worry that something
should’ve been done, that that

1354
00:54:12.948 --> 00:54:15.781
review should’ve been acted upon,
and I can’t think of a better

1355
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:18.156
example in terms of
the time we are at now.

1356
00:54:18.156 --> 00:54:19.198
Lisa?

1357
00:54:19.198 --> 00:54:21.906
Well, I was a bit concerned
to hear Tony saying that

1358
00:54:21.906 --> 00:54:24.073
the way the Black Lives Matter
protesters conduct themselves

1359
00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:27.490
doesn’t help their cause, because
I’ve been tremendously inspired

1360
00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.656
actually by a lot of the young
people who’ve come out and taken

1361
00:54:30.656 --> 00:54:33.990
to the streets in recent weeks,
and I think they are standing up and

1362
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.281
using their voice and the platform
that they have in order to try and

1363
00:54:37.281 --> 00:54:42.323
get change while generation
after generation have been failed.

1364
00:54:42.906 --> 00:54:45.740
You know, James said, "Well,
what you actually want to be done?"

1365
00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.448
But the Government itself
has sponsored four

1366
00:54:47.448 --> 00:54:50.073
reviews in the last four years
which have made 201 recommendations.

1367
00:54:50.073 --> 00:54:51.281
Those recommendations
actually have common

1368
00:54:51.281 --> 00:54:53.031
themes to them.

1369
00:54:53.031 --> 00:54:58.073
It’s about changing recruitment
practices so we get far

1370
00:54:58.115 --> 00:55:00.156
better representation at every level
in the criminaljustice

1371
00:55:00.156 --> 00:55:05.198
system, in the workplaces
and across society.

1372
00:55:06.365 --> 00:55:09.240
It’s about having a better education
system so that people to understand

1373
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.865
how this clinician actually works
and understand the complexity of the

1374
00:55:11.865 --> 00:55:15.281
history that we’ve got.

1375
00:55:15.281 --> 00:55:20.031
It’s about having better
legal representation.

1376
00:55:20.031 --> 00:55:21.573
It’s about incomes as well.

1377
00:55:21.573 --> 00:55:23.531
We were just talking
about child poverty, but

1378
00:55:23.531 --> 00:55:26.448
actually if you’re black you’re more
likely to be poor, you’re more

1379
00:55:26.448 --> 00:55:28.115
likely to be stopped by the police.

1380
00:55:28.115 --> 00:55:30.531
There are real disparities
in the immigration system as well.

1381
00:55:30.531 --> 00:55:32.448
These are things that
should be well known

1382
00:55:32.448 --> 00:55:33.948
to any politician of any party.

1383
00:55:33.948 --> 00:55:36.531
And thing now is that we get
on and implement them.

1384
00:55:36.531 --> 00:55:38.448
You can see why people
are so frustrated.

1385
00:55:38.448 --> 00:55:40.115
And I’lljust say this as well.

1386
00:55:40.115 --> 00:55:42.281
My dad’s generation
were amongst those who

1387
00:55:42.281 --> 00:55:47.115
fought for racial
equality in this country.

1388
00:55:47.115 --> 00:55:50.490
And they did make huge strides
forward. The way that they did it in

1389
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:52.073
forward. The way that they did it in
the end was through leadership,

1390
00:55:52.073 --> 00:55:52.990
the end was through leadership,
people like Roy

1391
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.781
the end was through leadership,
people like RoyJenkins who stepped

1392
00:55:53.781 --> 00:55:56.823
people like RoyJenkins who stepped
forward to bring in the Race

1393
00:55:56.823 --> 00:55:58.740
forward to bring in the Race
Relations Act, and that was at a

1394
00:55:58.740 --> 00:55:59.990
Relations Act, and that was at a
time that that was deeply

1395
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.448
time that that was deeply
controversial and pretty unpopular

1396
00:56:01.448 --> 00:56:03.781
controversial and pretty unpopular
in Britain. I would say to James, I

1397
00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:04.490
in Britain. I would say tojames, I
think the

1398
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:05.406
in Britain. I would say to James, I
think the Government’s in action is

1399
00:56:05.406 --> 00:56:07.156
think the Government’s in action is
based on a very dim view of people

1400
00:56:07.156 --> 00:56:11.031
based on a very dim view of people
in this country. Most people in this

1401
00:56:11.031 --> 00:56:11.448
in this country. Most peopla in this
country now

1402
00:56:11.448 --> 00:56:11.823
in this country. Most people in this
country now strongly believe

1403
00:56:11.823 --> 00:56:13.448
country now strongly believe
discrimination harms all of us even

1404
00:56:13.448 --> 00:56:15.115
discrimination harms all of us even
if we are not strongly affected by

1405
00:56:15.115 --> 00:56:17.865
if we are not strongly affected by
it. We care about one another, we

1406
00:56:17.865 --> 00:56:18.240
it. We rare about one another, we
are a

1407
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.448
it. We care about one another, we
are a tolerant society, and the

1408
00:56:19.448 --> 00:56:21.490
are a tolerant society, and the
Government really needs to get on

1409
00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:22.448
Government really needs to get on
and implement the recommendations

1410
00:56:22.448 --> 00:56:23.698
and implement the recommendations
from these reports, not

1411
00:56:23.698 --> 00:56:24.115
and implement the recommendations
from these reports, notjust kick

1412
00:56:24.115 --> 00:56:24.698
from these reports, not just kick
this into

1413
00:56:24.698 --> 00:56:26.156
from these reports, notjust kick
this into the long grass because if

1414
00:56:26.156 --> 00:56:27.365
this into the long grass because if
we have learned anything over the

1415
00:56:27.365 --> 00:56:30.115
we have learned anything over the
last few weeks it is that this just

1416
00:56:30.115 --> 00:56:31.615
last few weeks it is that this just
won’t cut it any more. James,

1417
00:56:31.615 --> 00:56:32.740
won’t cut it any more. james,
promised to

1418
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.156
won’t cut it any more. James,
promised to let you back in. Thank

1419
00:56:34.156 --> 00:56:34.906
promised to let you back in. Thank
you. I

1420
00:56:34.906 --> 00:56:35.990
promised to let you back in. Thank
you. lam not and

1421
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.115
promised to let you back in. Thank
you. lam notand I

1422
00:56:36.115 --> 00:56:36.573
promised to let you back in. Thank
you. I am not and I would never

1423
00:56:36.573 --> 00:56:36.948
you. lam not and Iwould never
suggest that

1424
00:56:36.948 --> 00:56:37.948
you. I am not and I would never
suggest that there is an improvement

1425
00:56:37.948 --> 00:56:39.948
suggest that there is an improvement
that could be made. There is a huge

1426
00:56:39.948 --> 00:56:41.281
that could be made. There is a huge
amount of improvement that could be

1427
00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:46.615
amount of improvement that could be
made. But to imply that we’ve not

1428
00:56:46.615 --> 00:56:46.990
made. But to imply that we’ve not
progressed is

1429
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.240
made. But to imply that we’ve not
progressed isjust

1430
00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:47.823
made. But to imply that we’ve not
progressed is just factually wrong,

1431
00:56:47.823 --> 00:56:49.031
progressed is just factually wrong,
and deeply insulting. Steve and I

1432
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:52.948
and deeply insulting. Steve and I
grew up in South East London, and

1433
00:56:52.948 --> 00:56:54.198
grew up in South East London, and
although he is infinitely better

1434
00:56:54.198 --> 00:56:56.281
although he is infinitely better
looking, he has a couple of years

1435
00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:58.073
looking, he has a couple of years
older, and I remember when the

1436
00:56:58.073 --> 00:56:58.323
older, and I remember when the
National

1437
00:56:58.323 --> 00:56:59.823
older, and I remember when the
Nationalfront march

1438
00:56:59.823 --> 00:57:00.823
older, and I remember when the
National front march through my

1439
00:57:00.823 --> 00:57:06.115
National front march through my
streets... That would never happen

1440
00:57:06.115 --> 00:57:07.448
streets... That would never happen
now. when

1441
00:57:07.448 --> 00:57:09.615
streets... That would never happen
now. When I was first elected onto

1442
00:57:09.615 --> 00:57:09.823
now. when I was first eluted onto
the

1443
00:57:09.823 --> 00:57:11.406
now. When I was first elected onto
the London assembly. I sat next to

1444
00:57:11.406 --> 00:57:13.490
the London assembly. I sat next to
an elected member of the British

1445
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:15.198
an elected member of the British
National Party, and explicitly

1446
00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.490
National Party, and explicitly
racist political party, elected into

1447
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.906
racist political party, eluted into
the

1448
00:57:16.906 --> 00:57:18.573
racist political party, elected into
the London Government by the voters

1449
00:57:18.573 --> 00:57:20.031
the London Government by the voters
of London. That would never happen

1450
00:57:20.031 --> 00:57:23.573
of London. That would never happen
now. When I was at school I had no

1451
00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:24.906
now. when I was at school I had no
idea... My mum

1452
00:57:24.906 --> 00:57:27.281
now. When I was at school I had no
idea... My mum was a black nurse,

1453
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:29.365
idea... My mum was a black nurse,
and my parents were a mixed race

1454
00:57:29.365 --> 00:57:31.031
and my parents were a mixed race
couple, getting spat at in the

1455
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:33.365
couple, getting spat at in the
street. That would never happen now.

1456
00:57:33.365 --> 00:57:35.448
street. That would never happen now.
We have progressed so far. And, yes,

1457
00:57:35.448 --> 00:57:37.156
We have progressed so far. And, yes,
there’s definitely room for

1458
00:57:37.156 --> 00:57:38.573
there’s definitely room for
improvement, but to deny the

1459
00:57:38.573 --> 00:57:41.115
improvement, but to deny the
positive steps this country has

1460
00:57:41.115 --> 00:57:45.073
positive steps this country has
made... Come on... We are asking

1461
00:57:45.073 --> 00:57:49.031
made... Come on... We are asking
why... That level of progress and

1462
00:57:49.031 --> 00:57:50.281
why... That level of progress and
that level of ambition? You know

1463
00:57:50.281 --> 00:57:52.448
that level of ambition? You know
what needs to be done. Sire make the

1464
00:57:52.448 --> 00:57:55.240
what needs to be done. Sire make the
point I am making... And, again, I

1465
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.281
point I am making... And, again, I
have been taught --

1466
00:57:57.281 --> 00:57:58.031
point I am making... And, again, I
have been taught —— I have been

1467
00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:58.406
have been taught -- I have been
taught black

1468
00:57:58.406 --> 00:57:59.906
have been taught —— I have been
taught black people in business, in

1469
00:57:59.906 --> 00:58:00.240
taught black peopla in business, in
the civil

1470
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.115
taught black people in business, in
the civil service, we are moving in

1471
00:58:02.115 --> 00:58:04.281
the civil service, we are moving in
the right direction and, yes, we

1472
00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:06.115
the right direction and, yes, we
should always aspire to move further

1473
00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:08.656
should always aspire to move further
and faster, but we must never deny

1474
00:58:08.656 --> 00:58:12.906
and faster, but we must never deny
the progress we have made.

1475
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:13.740
the progress we have made.
Otherwise, unsurprisingly, young

1476
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.448
Otherwise, unsurprisingly, young
black people in Britain will think

1477
00:58:16.448 --> 00:58:16.656
black peopla in Britain will think
that

1478
00:58:16.656 --> 00:58:19.573
black people in Britain will think
that there has been no progress, and

1479
00:58:19.573 --> 00:58:22.156
that there has been no progress, and
that’s just wrong. It’s wrong. 0K,

1480
00:58:22.156 --> 00:58:24.115
that’s just wrong. It’s wrong. 0K,

Do you think this is

We don’t know yet.

Novichok - in terms of protecting
citizens,

1536
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.365
this is about as bad as it gets.

1537

Is he going to be OK? I don’t know.

1538

All we know

we are their only line of defence.

1542
01:00:31.448 --> 01:00:33.656
We’re looking
for Britain’s next make-up star.

1543
01:00:33.656 --> 01:00:35.365
Ding—dong!

1544
01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.948
Judged by some of the biggest names
in the business.

cook a dish,
aiming for this reaction...

1547
01:00:47.365 --> 01:00:48.531
..not this one.

1548
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:49.781
It’s proper scary.

1549
01:00:49.781 --> 01:00:51.115
Come on, be a pancake.

1550
01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:52.365
Be a pancake.

1551
01:00:52.365 --> 01:00:54.406
What’s the difference between
a good and a bad dhal?

1552
01:00:54.406 --> 01:00:56.365
I don’t know,
but we’re about to find out.

1553
01:00:56.365 --> 01:00:57.823
When I tried it, it was white,

1554
01:00:57.823 --> 01:01:00.031
and this is more like
Oompa Loompa colour.

1555
01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:01.781
My plastic timer’s gone in the oven!

1556
01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:03.573
Who will rise and who will fall?

1557
01:01:03.573 --> 01:01:04.906
Service!

1558
01:01:31.448 --> 01:01:36.490
I think it’s time to catch
up with an old friend.

1559
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.656
Oh, I like the sound of that!

1560
01:01:39.656 --> 01:01:42.990
Do you want me to give you some
clues about who I have arranged

1561
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:44.656
for us to have a reunion with?

1562
01:01:44.656 --> 01:01:45.698
Yes.

1563
01:01:45.698 --> 01:01:46.740
Yeah.

Oh, I know who that is!

1572

It’s Andrew Neil!

1573
01:02:00.365 --> 01:02:02.781
Hello, Andrew.

1574
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:03.823
Hello to you!

1575
01:02:03.823 --> 01:02:05.031
Nice to hear from you.

1576
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:07.198
We have called you up
and tapped you up,

1577
01:02:07.198 --> 01:02:10.115
because we want to get all your
thoughts about the Franco British

1578
01:02:10.115 --> 01:02:12.448
relationship on this special,
special day, when everyone has been

1579
01:02:12.448 --> 01:02:14.198
thinking about Charles de Gaulle.

1580
01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.615
Well, I am glad you have,
because the Franco British

1581
01:02:16.615 --> 01:02:21.156
relationship is actually in pretty
good condition at the moment, which

1582
01:02:21.156 --> 01:02:23.240
may surprise you.

1583
01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.156
Brexit, you think, might
have derailed it, but

1584
01:02:25.156 --> 01:02:29.823
curiously, what is actually meant,
and I will come on and talk a bit

1585
01:02:29.823 --> 01:02:33.115
more about this, is that Brexit has
put more of a premium on the

1586
01:02:33.115 --> 01:02:36.865
bilateral issue between London and
Paris than before and I expect we

1587
01:02:36.865 --> 01:02:40.240
are going to see it develop a lot
more in the months ahead, regardless

1588
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.198
of how the Brexit negotiations go.

1589
01:02:43.198 --> 01:02:46.406
And much more news from our South of
France correspondent very shortly.

1590
01:02:46.406 --> 01:02:49.240
On this episode of the
Coronavirus Newscast.

The Coronavirus Newscast,
from the BBC.

1592

Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:03.865
And it’s Laura in the studio,
but I am going to say, Bon

01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:05.698
Soir instead.

1595
01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:08.323
Bon Soir, Laura, from
Christophe in Le Box of News.

1596
01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:10.490
And you get to go that bit further.

1597
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.948
We’ll talk about Charles de Gaulle’s
famous speech, it was

1598
01:03:12.948 --> 01:03:16.240
the 80th anniversary of it today,
and we thought we would mark it by

1599
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.948
getting a living famous French
legend to recreate it, in their

1600
01:03:18.948 --> 01:03:20.281
living room.

1601
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:23.531

01:03:24.698 --> 01:03:25.781
Fantastic!

1604
01:03:25.781 --> 01:03:30.823
Alors!

1605
01:03:34.406 --> 01:03:35.448
Honour.

1606
01:03:35.448 --> 01:03:36.490
Common sense.

1607
01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.365
And in the interests of the country,
we require that all free

1608
01:03:39.365 --> 01:03:42.240
Frenchmen, wherever they he, should
continue the fight as best they may.

1609
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.448
Stirring stuff from David Ginola.

1610
01:03:43.448 --> 01:03:45.865
Also, not sure if you
are aware, it is also

1611
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.031
the third anniversary
of the

1612
01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:48.948
first ever episode of
a podcast called Brexitcast.

1613
01:03:48.948 --> 01:03:50.031
I didn’t know that.

1614
01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:52.906
That is why the Elysee Palace sent
the President to London today.

1615
01:03:52.906 --> 01:03:55.073
Did he not pop in
and see you, Chris?

1616
01:03:55.073 --> 01:03:56.073
He didn’t, no.

1617
01:03:56.073 --> 01:03:57.281
He didn’t have time, apparently.

1618
01:03:57.281 --> 01:03:58.323
Never mind.

1619
01:03:58.323 --> 01:03:59.531
Right, on with today’s news.

1620
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.948
So, Dominic Raab,
the Foreign Secretary,

1621
01:04:00.948 --> 01:04:03.865
has made some controversial comments
on the radio this morning, when he

1622
01:04:03.865 --> 01:04:06.698
was asked about this symbol that
people have been doing, of taking

1623
01:04:06.698 --> 01:04:09.656
the knee, whether it is American
footballers doing it a few years

1624
01:04:09.656 --> 01:04:14.031
ago, or British footballers doing it
in the last couple of days,

1625
01:04:14.031 --> 01:04:18.198
in solidarity with Black
Lives Matter campaigners.

1626
01:04:18.198 --> 01:04:20.573
Here is what Dominic Raab
said when he was asked

1627
01:04:20.573 --> 01:04:21.906
about it this morning.

1628
01:04:21.906 --> 01:04:25.115
I understand this sense
of frustration and

1629
01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:28.573
restlessness which is driving
the Black Lives Matter movement.

1630
01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:30.740
I’ve got to say,
on this taking the knee

1631
01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.656
thing, which I don’t
know, maybe it’s got

1632
01:04:32.656 --> 01:04:33.865
a broader history,
but it

1633
01:04:33.865 --> 01:04:36.031
seems to be taken from
the Game of Thrones.

1634
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:38.406
It seems to me like
a symbol of subjugation or

1635
01:04:38.406 --> 01:04:41.281
subordination, rather than one
of liberation and emancipation.

1636
01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:42.740
But I understand people
feel differently

1637
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.156
about it, so it is a matter
of personal choice.

1638
01:04:45.156 --> 01:04:47.031
So, would you or wouldn’t you do it?

1639
01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:49.698
I would take the knee for two
people, the Queen and

1640
01:04:49.698 --> 01:04:51.865
the missus, when I
asked her to marry me.

1641
01:04:51.865 --> 01:04:52.990
LAUGHTER.

1642
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:54.740
That was Julia Hartley—Brewer
interviewing the

1643
01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.948
Foreign Secretary on Talk
Radio this morning.

1644
01:04:57.948 --> 01:04:58.990
Yes.

1645
01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:03.156
Laura, subjugation, Game of Thrones?

1646
01:05:03.156 --> 01:05:06.281
I think it is fair to say that
that was not the most

1647
01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:08.448
diplomatic choice of words
from the politician who is,

1648
01:05:08.448 --> 01:05:09.906
after all, our diplomat in chief.

1649
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:13.115
And, for several reasons,
number one, this is an

1650
01:05:13.115 --> 01:05:18.115
enormously emotive and sensitive
subject and I think all politicians

1651
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.656
normally try to carefully be as
sensitive as they possibly can and,
