marching its way into the north west
of Scotland and Northern Ireland.

of Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The next band of rain pushing into

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.086
The next band of rain pushing into
northern parts of England and Wales,

11
00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:15.252
northern parts of England and Walas,
quickly

12
00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:15.961
northern parts of England and Wales,
quickly followed by some sharp

13
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.127
quickly followed by some sharp
showers. To the south 3 bit of mist

14
00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:18.836
showers. To the south a bit of mist
and it will

15
00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:20.169
showers. To the south 3 bit of mist
and it will be cooler than last

16
00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.419
and it will be cooler than last
night, frost levels in the North

17
00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.169
night, frost levels in the North
will pick up with the arrival of the

18
00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.252
will pick up with the arrival of the
rain which clears through quickly

19
00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:27.502
rain which clears through quickly
from Scotland, Northern Ireland,

20
00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:29.419
from Scotland, Northern Ireland,
northern England and Wales but it

21
00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.586
northern England and Walas but it
takes

22
00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:30.627
northern England and Wales but it
takes until lunchtime to reach

23
00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:31.752
takes until lunchtime to reach
southern and eastern parts of

24
00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:33.877
southern and eastern parts of
England and it could be heavy, so

25
00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:35.086
England and it could be heavy, so
will the showers following on behind

26
00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:38.044
will the showers following on behind
with hail and thunder. Look at the

27
00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.627
with hail and thunder. Look at the
temperature difference. 8—10 in the

28
00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:40.836
temperature difference. 8-10 in the
north

29
00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:42.419
temperature difference. 8—10 in the
north tomorrow compared with the

30
00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.627
north tomorrow compared with the
same teens today, only 13 or M at

31
00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:45.211
same teens today, only 13 or 14 at
best in the

32
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.877
same teens today, only 13 or M at
best in the south because we have a

33
00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:47.794
best in the south because we have a
North north—westerly wind blowing

34
00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:47.877
North north-westerty wind blowing
the

35
00:00:47.877 --> 00:00:49.002
North north—westerly wind blowing
the cold air down from the Arctic.

36
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.669
the cold air down from the Arctic.
It will stay with us through the

37
00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:53.544
It will stay with us through the
weekend. A brisk northerly wind

38
00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:53.877
weekend. A brisk northerty wind
ushering in

39
00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:54.711
weekend. A brisk northerly wind
ushering in more showers through

40
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:55.836
ushering in more showers through
Saturday especially through northern

41
00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:57.419
Saturday especially through northern
and western areas but they could be

42
00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:58.919
and western areas but they could be
some further east as well and

43
00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:00.127
some further east as well and
obviously if you are sheltered from

44
00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.961
obviously if you are sheltered from
the wind it won’t feel can

45
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.127
the wind it won’t feel can
unpleasant but for most of us

46
00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:04.586
unpleasant but for most of us
temperatures are well down on what

47
00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:07.211
temperatures are well down on what
we’ve become used to this week.

48
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:09.377
we’ve become used to this week.
Probably fewer showers by Sunday,

49
00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:10.752
Probably fewer showers by Sunday,
because we see a ridge of high

50
00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:12.377
because we see a ridge of high
pressure starting to build in from

51
00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.794
pressure starting to build in from
the west, but still there is a keen

52
00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:15.086
the west, but still there is a keen
northerty wind

53
00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:16.044
the west, but still there is a keen
northerly wind blowing and it could

54
00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:17.877
northerly wind blowing and it could
still bring a few showers,

55
00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:18.044
still bring a few showers,
particularly

56
00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:20.544
Keep using that word "lie".

57
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:22.752
It’s not the lie, it’s the cover—up.

58
00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:24.086
You know the Prime Minister.

59
00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:25.419
Yeah, I do — petty.

60
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.919
It’s somebody that says
she’s your daughter.

61
00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:29.836
The briefing you asked for
on Peter Laurence —

62
00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:31.669
MI5 put it together.

63
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:33.086
So you’re saying you’re clean?

64
00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:34.211
Squeaky.

65
00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:13.502

Welcome to my guests

to Yanis Varoufakis,

Very good to have you with us.

93
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:25.419
Our live audience is with us
again, via video link,

94
00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.044
as we are doing it these days.

95
00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:29.252
Tonight, you are all in Coventry,

96
00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:31.127

00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:33.044
Thank you for being

98
00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:35.919
And for all of you watching at home,
do join the conversation.

99
00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.669
The usual way, on social
media, @BBCQuestionTime.

100
00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.336
Let’s hear what you have to say.

101
00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:41.252
So, let’s take our first question
tonight and that is from Jak Davies.

102
00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:45.711
With cases continuing to rapidly
rise and areas now going back

103
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:49.377
into full lockdowns,
and venues closing their doors yet

104
00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:52.002
again, is a second national
lockdown not a case of "if"

105
00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:57.002
anymore, but "when"?

106
00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:02.127
And what does this mean for a lot
of businesses already

107
00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:05.544
struggling to survive?

108
00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:07.711
So, let’s talk about lockdown,
or certainly greater restrictions.

109
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:08.752
Andy?

110
00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:11.377
Well, we have been in lockdown
for most of the summer.

111
00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.502
And, I have to say, people
in Greater Manchester

112
00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:14.544
are really, really struggling.

113
00:05:14.544 --> 00:05:17.211
And we are just finding it
hard now, with the way

114
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:18.627
the Government is handling this.

115
00:05:18.627 --> 00:05:21.044
I’ve tried to work with
the Government all the way

116
00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:22.961
through this crisis.

117
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:25.669
But it does feel increasingly
to people like they are being

118
00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.294
treated with contempt in the North
of England, because last night

119
00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.461
a newspaper puts out
a front page that says,

120
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:32.836
pubs and restaurants
are going to be shut on Monday

121
00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:36.461
across the North of England.

122
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.877
Now, I didn’t know about that.

123
00:05:37.877 --> 00:05:40.377
They haven’t told me.

124
00:05:40.377 --> 00:05:42.502
It doesn’t really matter about me.

125
00:05:42.502 --> 00:05:45.336
What about the people who work
in those pubs and those restaurants

126
00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:49.544
right across the North of England?

127
00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:54.544
And, you know, for me, this hasjust
got to stop, to be honest.

128
00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.044
We cannot face a national crisis
with the Governmentjust imposing

129
00:05:58.044 --> 00:06:01.252
decisions from the centre with no
agreement with people who have

130
00:06:01.252 --> 00:06:04.877
to face the real world today,
where people are saying,

131
00:06:04.877 --> 00:06:07.961
we can’t go in another lockdown,
and our businesses will finish.

132
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:10.169
This is the point I have
made to ministers.

133
00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.836
On Monday, said to them,
let’s have a reset movement around

134
00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:17.252
this new traffic light system,
this tier system.

135
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.419
I said I was prepared to go with it.

136
00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:20.877
But it must come with support.

137
00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:23.627
We’ve been under restrictions
without support in the north

138
00:06:23.627 --> 00:06:26.252
of England, in Greater Manchester,
Bolton saw pubs and restaurants shot

139
00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:30.627
and the staff in those places
who work behind the bar

140
00:06:30.627 --> 00:06:33.294
and the kitchen had no local
furlough scheme to help them.

141
00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:35.211
And the message I’ve
given to the Government

142
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:36.461
is a pretty clear one.

143
00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:41.336
You know, there can be no
restrictions without support.

144
00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:43.961
And if it is going to be
the Tier 3 restrictions,

145
00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:47.711
effectively a national lockdown,
we have to go back to a full

146
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.544
furlough scheme for those staff,
support for those businesses.

147
00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.961
Otherwise, the North
of England is going to be

148
00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:54.169
levelled down this winter.

149
00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.961
And I won’t accept it.

150
00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:59.877
I will not accept
restrictions without support. the Government

151
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:02.752
just imposing these decisions on us,

152
00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:06.211
briefing them to newspapers
late at night.

153
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:08.836
They need to treat the people
of the north of England

154
00:07:08.836 --> 00:07:10.919
with more respect.

155
00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:14.044
And when you say you won’t accept
it, what are you talking about?

156
00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:16.294
Civil disobedience?

157
00:07:16.294 --> 00:07:18.044
I won’t support it.

158
00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:20.461
So, earlier in the summer
they asked for my support,

159
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:22.544
and I did provide it.

160
00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:24.919
But if they come with restrictions,
Fiona, without full support

161
00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.752
for the people and businesses
affected, I won’t support it.

162
00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:29.877
But, actually, more than that,
I will challenge it.

163
00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:32.294
I will use whatever means
I can to challenge it,

164
00:07:32.294 --> 00:07:35.044
get support for people.

165
00:07:35.044 --> 00:07:36.961
Because, otherwise,
they are going to suffer real

166
00:07:36.961 --> 00:07:38.002
hardship this winter.

167
00:07:38.002 --> 00:07:43.002
We are going to see
businesses failing.

168
00:07:43.752 --> 00:07:46.086
I even threatened possible legal
action over the A—level results

169
00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:48.752
in the summer because I wasn’t
prepared to accept that either.

170
00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:51.669
Because that disadvantages young
people in the North of England.

171
00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:53.377
We need a change here.

172
00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:57.086
I’ve offered to work with them
time and time again.

173
00:07:57.086 --> 00:08:00.127
But I think that the mood
in the north of England this week,

174
00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.294
speaking to local leaders,
business leaders, is the Government

175
00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:05.419
has lost the dressing room
and they need to work very hard now

176
00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:06.961
to get it back.

177
00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:10.044
Gillian?

178
00:08:10.044 --> 00:08:14.961
Well, I think what Andy
hasn’t said, actually,

179
00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:18.419
which is that we are facing
an unbelievably serious situation.

180
00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:21.294
And if you just cut that
into context, less than two months

181
00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:24.377
ago we were quarantining
holiday—makers coming back

182
00:08:24.377 --> 00:08:27.836
from various countries around
the world because they had more

183
00:08:27.836 --> 00:08:32.752
than 20 cases per 100,000
in those places.

184
00:08:32.752 --> 00:08:34.877
Today, in Manchester,
I believe it is way over

185
00:08:34.877 --> 00:08:37.294
500 cases per 100,000.

186
00:08:37.294 --> 00:08:41.419
It is extremely serious.

187
00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.294
It is a very, very difficult balance
that we have to make.

188
00:08:44.294 --> 00:08:47.294
But it’s extremely serious.

189
00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:49.961
Two thirds of the hospitalisations
that has happened of all covert

190
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:52.836
patients in the whole of the UK has
happened in the north—east,

191
00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:55.669
the North West and Yorkshire.

192
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:56.711
——Covid patients.

193
00:08:56.711 --> 00:08:58.377
Two thirds of everybody
going into hospital

194
00:08:58.377 --> 00:09:03.377
in the country, in those places.

195
00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.211
This is serious.

196
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.711
It is getting out of control.

197
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.544
And we have to do something to bring
it back under control.

198
00:09:10.544 --> 00:09:12.711
Now, of course, there’s been some
local lockdown restrictions.

199
00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:15.086
Moving to single households,
obviously the curfew of 10pm has

200
00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:16.169
been there for everybody.

201
00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:17.836
The rule of six, across the country.

202
00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:20.794
But the cases are still rising.

203
00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:23.127
So, we do need, we definitely
need to work locally

204
00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:25.544
and we definitely need to make sure
that the communications

205
00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:26.586
are much clearer.

206
00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:28.252
And I do agree with you, Andy.

207
00:09:28.252 --> 00:09:33.294
I think it’s probably very
frustrating for everybody if leaks

208
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.961
are made or there’s
speculation in the press.

209
00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:43.127
And I don’t know
which of these it is.

210
00:09:43.127 --> 00:09:46.461
But clearly we have to do something
if we are going to bring those

211
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.544
cases back under control.

212
00:09:47.544 --> 00:09:51.377
We have one thing we need to do,
which is to try to get that R

213
00:09:51.377 --> 00:09:52.544
rate back to below 1.

214
00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:54.211
What about support for
businesses, for example?

215
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:55.877
Well, of course we have
done unprecedented

216
00:09:55.877 --> 00:09:56.919
support for businesses.

217
00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.961
The furlough scheme...

218
00:09:57.961 --> 00:09:59.211
But from here on in?

219
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:01.836
The furlough scheme is still
existing, it is still in place

220
00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:03.252
until the end of this month.

221
00:10:03.252 --> 00:10:06.377
And then we have the winter economic
package, which is introduced

222
00:10:06.377 --> 00:10:09.461
from the 1st of November,
which is for restrictions,

223
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:14.419
and restricted times.

224
00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:17.336
The Chancellor has looked
at some industries as well,

225
00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:19.502
there have been specific sector
deals, specific sector support.

226
00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:21.419
We have said that we will
support businesses.

227
00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:22.502
We have supported businesses.

228
00:10:22.502 --> 00:10:24.127
There’s been grants,
there’s been VAT cuts,

229
00:10:24.127 --> 00:10:29.169
there’s been business rate
cuts, there’s been...

230
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.127
You closed pubs and restaurants
in Bolton overnight,

231
00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:32.294
just a few weeks ago.

232
00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:35.627
The people who work behind the bar
in those places or in the kitchen

233
00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:36.877
got no support at all.

234
00:10:36.877 --> 00:10:38.502
Do you think that is right?

235
00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:40.419
Well, the people would be
entitled to furlough.

236
00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:41.419
Well, they weren’t.

237
00:10:41.419 --> 00:10:42.461
Why were they not?

238
00:10:42.461 --> 00:10:43.711
Because it was closed overnight.

239
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:47.086
Theirjobs were just taken away
from them overnight.

240
00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:51.002
Well, their employers could have put
them on to furlough.

241
00:10:51.002 --> 00:10:53.086
That’s exactly what that
scheme is there for.

242
00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.127
It is there...

243
00:10:54.127 --> 00:10:56.836
You know, everything was closed
overnight on the 23rd of March.

244
00:10:56.836 --> 00:10:57.836
Everything was closed overnight.

245
00:10:57.836 --> 00:11:00.211
You know, look at the skies,
you won’t see hardly

246
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.252
any planes flying.

247
00:11:01.252 --> 00:11:03.169
Go on a train, there
will be hardly...

248
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:05.586
Well, Michael could tell us,
but there will hardly be

249
00:11:05.586 --> 00:11:06.669
anyone on the train.

250
00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:09.086
Honestly, Gillian, people working
behind bars cannot be put easily

251
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:10.086
into a furlough scheme.

252
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.794
Well, they were put
into furlough schemes.

253
00:11:11.794 --> 00:11:12.961
The point that you’re missing...

254
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:15.377
All across the country,
for that six months, they were.

255
00:11:15.377 --> 00:11:17.586
We have been under restrictions,
local restrictions, without support.

256
00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:18.752
And that’s happened all summer.

257
00:11:18.752 --> 00:11:20.877
If you’re going to introduce
a traffic light scheme,

258
00:11:20.877 --> 00:11:23.836
that will trap large parts
of the north of England under severe

259
00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:27.961
restrictions this winter,
can I ask you, do you think we need

260
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.669
a proper support scheme
so that we don’t see major loss

261
00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:31.836
ofjobs, major business failure?

262
00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:35.461
Would you commit to that tonight?

263
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.836
Because if you will,
I will work with your government

264
00:11:37.836 --> 00:11:39.669
to then put that in place.

265
00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:41.336
What we were presented
with was restrictions

266
00:11:41.336 --> 00:11:43.544
without support, and that is not
acceptable to us.

267
00:11:43.544 --> 00:11:45.919
For some reason, Andy,
you seem to not have realised

268
00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:49.336
that the furlough scheme that we put
in place in March, which is still

269
00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:54.336
in place today, which we have
spent £40 billion on...

270
00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:58.211
But Gillian, as I am sure you know,
it is closed to new entrants.

271
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:00.919
Yes, but it’s closed off
at the end of this month.

272
00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:01.961
But it’s been there...

273
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.752
It’s closed to new entrants.

274
00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:06.669
The Bolton staff could not
access that scheme.

275
00:12:06.669 --> 00:12:11.711
It closed on the 30th ofJune.

276
00:12:11.752 --> 00:12:14.586
And the point is, furlough ends
on the end of this month.

277
00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:15.627
Yes, and we have...

278
00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:17.836
In industries like aviation,
for instance, can’t come back.

279
00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:20.711
So the damage you’re going to do
to those people who work

280
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:22.377
in regional airports,
combined with the local

281
00:12:22.377 --> 00:12:24.294
restrictions, means that fragile
economies in the North

282
00:12:24.294 --> 00:12:27.086
are going to be...

283
00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:29.544
Can I just correct you?

284
00:12:29.544 --> 00:12:31.461
It’s the damage that
the coronavirus, the global

285
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:32.502
pandemic is doing.

286
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.877
The Government has been
there to help as many people

287
00:12:34.877 --> 00:12:39.919
as we can every step of the way.

288
00:12:42.544 --> 00:12:44.711
It is not the Government
that are doing this,

289
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:46.836
it is the coronavirus,
it’s the public health epidemic

290
00:12:46.836 --> 00:12:47.877
we are dealing with.

291
00:12:47.877 --> 00:12:50.002
The Government are choosing to close
bars and restaurants,

292
00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.086
that’s your choice.

293
00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:53.752
Jak, you asked the question,
you had your hand up again?

294
00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:57.086
Public health is an issue.

295
00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:59.711
Yeah, in terms of a national
lockdown, if it is necessary,

296
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:02.377
then it is necessary.

297
00:13:02.377 --> 00:13:04.961
But I think the thing
I fear about it, I work

298
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:06.919
in the hospitality industry,
is, with the furlough,

299
00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.752
that does come to an end
at the end of the month.

300
00:13:10.752 --> 00:13:14.252
And come the 1st of November,
the scheme that’s in place isn’t

301
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:18.836
going to be able to pay my bills
for me to be able to live, coming

302
00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:21.502
into winter, when it’s colder,
you need to use heating more,

303
00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.377
and nobody blames the Government
for coronavirus, obviously.

304
00:13:23.377 --> 00:13:25.461
It’s completely out of your hands.

305
00:13:25.461 --> 00:13:29.044
But when it comes to people living,
I fear that we are going to lose

306
00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:30.961
a lot of team, from where I work.

307
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:33.627
We are not going to be
able to afford to live.

308
00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:38.627
And it’s such last minute.

309
00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:48.336
As you said, with the north,
it was overnight.

310
00:13:48.336 --> 00:13:51.461
Being able to close a business
and tell your team they cannot work,

311
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:54.127
and you don’t know what’s
going to happen with their pay,

312
00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:55.127
overnight, it’s worrying.

313
00:13:55.127 --> 00:13:56.752
It’s really worrying.

314
00:13:56.752 --> 00:14:01.294
Jasper?

315
00:14:01.294 --> 00:14:04.169
Yeah, I’d just like to say that
we’ve got to remember,

316
00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:07.711
behind all the big numbers
of people, those injobs,

317
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:09.836
that will suffer from mental health,
financial burdens, pressures

318
00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:11.211
on families, it’s huge.

319
00:14:11.211 --> 00:14:13.627
And because it’s unprecedented, why
can’t we take unprecedented action?

320
00:14:13.627 --> 00:14:18.461
Why can’t we just say take
all the politics out of this,

321
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:21.127
because it always feels like a bit
of a slanging match,

322
00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:24.752
why can’t you just sort of say,
you know what, have a uniform

323
00:14:24.752 --> 00:14:26.502
government and take
massive, big actions.

324
00:14:26.502 --> 00:14:28.877
Because, really, it needs to have
more of a humanitarian

325
00:14:28.877 --> 00:14:30.836
approach to this, rather
than a political approach.

326
00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:35.836
Take the politics out,
put the people first.

327
00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:43.044
You know, if someone said to me,
yourjob’s gone the next day,

328
00:14:43.044 --> 00:14:44.502
I wouldn’t know what to do.

329
00:14:44.502 --> 00:14:47.377
Paul, I’m going to use your surname,
because we’ve got three Pauls

330
00:14:47.377 --> 00:14:48.419
in our virtual audience.

331
00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:49.502
Paul Somerfield?

332
00:14:49.502 --> 00:14:50.502
Yeah, good evening.

333
00:14:50.502 --> 00:14:52.877
There is no doubt about it, Andy,
I certainly appreciate

334
00:14:52.877 --> 00:14:54.377
and understand where
you’re coming from.

335
00:14:54.377 --> 00:14:56.294
But I certainly agree
with what Jasper said.

336
00:14:56.294 --> 00:15:01.252
We really must unite
and stop Boris bashing,

337
00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.836
there’s been no other Prime Minister
who has governed during such

338
00:15:08.836 --> 00:15:10.044
horrendous times in our peacetime.

339
00:15:10.044 --> 00:15:14.752
Now is the time of the
United Kingdom to all unite,

340
00:15:14.752 --> 00:15:17.377
get behind him and stick
to the rules and the regulations.

341
00:15:17.377 --> 00:15:18.836
Because there is no quick fix.

342
00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:20.294
It’s not going to be easy.

343
00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:21.752
There are going to be hardships.

344
00:15:21.752 --> 00:15:23.127
I stress, we must all unite.

345
00:15:23.127 --> 00:15:26.002
Can Ijust reassure you,
I said to the Government this week,

346
00:15:26.002 --> 00:15:28.502
let’s reset things, bring national
and local government back together,

347
00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:31.086
let’s agree these traffic lights,
get the support right as well,

348
00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:33.752
and just two days later,
the front page of the times,

349
00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:35.169
bars to shut across northern
England.

350
00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:39.877
That explains my mood this evening.

351
00:15:39.877 --> 00:15:41.586
Nobody has taken any
decision lightly, Andy.

352
00:15:41.586 --> 00:15:42.919
Nobody.

353
00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:44.627
And obviously the scientific
advisers are there,

354
00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:46.252
reading data every day.

355
00:15:46.252 --> 00:15:47.461
This is a serious situation.

356
00:15:47.461 --> 00:15:50.086
It’s very serious and to having
an impact on peoples health,

357
00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:55.127
and is very worrying.

358
00:15:58.294 --> 00:16:00.919
I must come to the rest
of the panel as well.

359
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.086
Yanis, you are coming to us
from Athens tonight.

360
00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:05.252
Jak’s question is, is a second
national lockdown not

361
00:16:05.252 --> 00:16:07.836
a case of "if" any more,
but "when", and what about

362
00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:08.877
businesses struggling to survive.

363
00:16:08.877 --> 00:16:12.461
Greece has had a pretty good
coronavirus experience, relatively.

364
00:16:12.461 --> 00:16:15.627
Yes, in a sense we have been
watching with a look of glee

365
00:16:15.627 --> 00:16:18.211
on our collective face,
as the result of the fact that,

366
00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:21.127
for the first time in many years,
we are not the butt

367
00:16:21.127 --> 00:16:25.877
of the European joke.

368
00:16:25.877 --> 00:16:28.544
You know, there is the
United Kingdom doing worse than us.

369
00:16:28.544 --> 00:16:30.461
But, besidesjoking,
Greece has done much better

370
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:35.502
than the United Kingdom
for three reasons.

371
00:16:38.586 --> 00:16:40.794
First, because the Balkan Peninsula
has, happily for us,

372
00:16:40.794 --> 00:16:42.669
being outside the thoroughfare
of trajectory of Covid—19.

373
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.794
We are not as promiscuous in terms
of being a hub of finance,

374
00:16:45.794 --> 00:16:50.836
of tourism, like Britain is.

375
00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:55.836
So, that has sheltered us.

376
00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:58.502
Also, the government, remember,
I was saying this as a leader

377
00:16:58.502 --> 00:16:59.877
of an opposition party,
government, nevertheless,

378
00:16:59.877 --> 00:17:01.586
was quick to respond,
unlike Borisjohnson.

379
00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:06.627
They wasted a fantastic opportunity,
however, to plan for phase two.

380
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:14.127
So, now, they’ve lost
control of phase two.

381
00:17:14.127 --> 00:17:16.294
What’s striking about this
conversation is that it’s very

382
00:17:16.294 --> 00:17:19.836
similar to the one we are having
in this neck of the woods.

383
00:17:19.836 --> 00:17:24.127
Michael Portillo.

384
00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:26.794
Jak’s first question was is there
going to be another lockdown.

385
00:17:26.794 --> 00:17:29.836
I think the answer to that is no,
it’s not going to be

386
00:17:29.836 --> 00:17:33.419
the same as before.

387
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.586
For example, I think the government
is absolutely determined

388
00:17:35.586 --> 00:17:38.252
not to close schools,
and I think it’ll want to keep

389
00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:39.419
a lot of businesses open.

390
00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:41.586
I think this time it’ll
look much more carefully

391
00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:43.502
what is the relationship
between new cases

392
00:17:43.502 --> 00:17:47.211
and hospitalisations,
people on ventilators,

393
00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:49.586
the number of deaths,
and I think there will be

394
00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:54.627
a different approach to risk.

395
00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:57.127
The other thing, though,
that I think has to change,

396
00:17:57.127 --> 00:17:59.294
and I very much sympathised
with Andy on this,

397
00:17:59.294 --> 00:18:01.919
is that the government has to take
more voices into consideration

398
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:05.544
before it makes decisions.

399
00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:09.127
On the one hand, that means
Parliament, so it isn’t good enough

400
00:18:09.127 --> 00:18:11.044
to make decisions and then
retrospectively to ask

401
00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:13.836
Parliament’s opinion.

402
00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:16.961
And I think the government would be
very well advised to consult more

403
00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:18.461
with local authorities.

404
00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:21.127
Indeed, I’d go much further,
I think the government should give

405
00:18:21.127 --> 00:18:23.752
many of the responsibilities
to the local authorities

406
00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:26.336
and for local authorities to take
the actions which they deem

407
00:18:26.336 --> 00:18:27.836
to be appropriate.

408
00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:30.919
And what difference do
you think that’ll make?

409
00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:32.836
I think it would make
a difference certainly

410
00:18:32.836 --> 00:18:37.836
to the political conversation.

411
00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:42.836
I mean people like Andy would be
singing a different tune

412
00:18:42.836 --> 00:18:44.002
if that were the case.

413
00:18:44.002 --> 00:18:47.794
I personally think it is more likely
that public health officials

414
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.711
at the regional, city
and local level understand

415
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.461
the situation better
than officials who are central

416
00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:55.377
but there is also a political point,
which is that the questions

417
00:18:55.377 --> 00:18:58.252
about this disease are very
difficult to answer.

418
00:18:58.252 --> 00:18:59.877
You know, what is the objective now?

419
00:18:59.877 --> 00:19:02.836
Is the objective to reduce
the number of deaths?

420
00:19:02.836 --> 00:19:05.002
To reduce the number
of deaths to zero?

421
00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:07.252
Is it to stop the NHS
being overwhelmed?

422
00:19:07.252 --> 00:19:09.169
Is it to strike a balance?

423
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:12.544
Are we now interested
in group immunity?

424
00:19:12.544 --> 00:19:15.919
These questions are terribly
difficult to answer and I think

425
00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:18.627
instead of the government having
to answer all of these questions,

426
00:19:18.627 --> 00:19:21.586
mayors should have to answer
these questions as well.

427
00:19:21.586 --> 00:19:25.919
So, by all means, let Andy do
something different in Manchester

428
00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:28.544
from what is equivalent its doing
in Liverpool and somebody else

429
00:19:28.544 --> 00:19:30.086
is doing in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

430
00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.794
Let others have regional diversity.

431
00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:35.377
There is also, by the way,
another reason why I think

432
00:19:35.377 --> 00:19:39.127
this might be of benefit
to the government, which is it

433
00:19:39.127 --> 00:19:41.544
would reduce its Scottish political
problem because at the moment

434
00:19:41.544 --> 00:19:43.961
you have BorisJohnson on the one
hand, Nicola Sturgeon,

435
00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:45.877
who is perceived as doing
very much better.

436
00:19:45.877 --> 00:19:48.044
If you had a variety
of regional voices, so,

437
00:19:48.044 --> 00:19:50.544
Andy doing his policies,
the Mayor of Liverpool

438
00:19:50.544 --> 00:19:54.127
doing his policies, you’d reduce...

439
00:19:54.127 --> 00:19:56.544
So, it’s spreading the blame,
that’s what you’re talking about.

440
00:19:56.544 --> 00:19:58.669
Well, spreading the blame?

441
00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:00.877
Spreading the responsibility.

442
00:20:00.877 --> 00:20:03.169
Let me go back to my previous point.

443
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:08.211
If you have a debate in Parliament,
the funny thing that happens is that

444
00:20:09.086 --> 00:20:11.252
people pop up with all sorts
of common—sense questions.

445
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.669
You know, how does this work?

446
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:15.586
Will it apply to this person,
will it apply to that person?

447
00:20:15.586 --> 00:20:16.752
Funnily enough, through
Parliamentary debates,

448
00:20:16.752 --> 00:20:18.669
because members of Parliament talk
to their constituents,

449
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:22.086
who are members of the public,
you get common—sense points of view

450
00:20:22.086 --> 00:20:25.169
which are brought forward before
legislation is drafted

451
00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:27.836
rather than afterwards.

452
00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:30.294
And if they come up afterwards,
then the government has

453
00:20:30.294 --> 00:20:33.669
to explain them away rather
than improve the legislation.

454
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:36.086
50, Donna, Jak’s question
is a second national lockdown not

455
00:20:36.086 --> 00:20:39.669
a case of if any more but when.

456
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:43.169
You are at the front
line of all this.

457
00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:45.794
What’s your view and is it
something you’d welcome?

458
00:20:45.794 --> 00:20:49.336
It is a worry because we
are seeing cases rise.

459
00:20:49.336 --> 00:20:54.419
But, actually, the answer to that,
Jak, depends on how we behave.

460
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.336
We’ve already been
through coronavirus,

461
00:20:57.336 --> 00:21:00.002
we’ve been at the height
of the pandemic.

462
00:21:00.002 --> 00:21:02.836
We know what to do if we want
to suppress this virus,

463
00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:04.794
we know what actions
we need to take.

464
00:21:04.794 --> 00:21:07.419
And, yes, of course, we are talking
about to different things,

465
00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:10.294
they are irreconcilable.

466
00:21:10.294 --> 00:21:14.836
One is how are we going to maintain
the economy, keep ourjobs,

467
00:21:14.836 --> 00:21:18.002
the other one is about how
are we going to keep ourselves well,

468
00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:19.461
healthy and save lives.

469
00:21:19.461 --> 00:21:22.127
And we have to remember that this
virus causes untold problems

470
00:21:22.127 --> 00:21:27.127
for some of our population.

471
00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:32.836
It is not for all of our population
but for some of our population.

472
00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:36.002
And, you know, I take the panel back
to unless you’ve got health,

473
00:21:36.002 --> 00:21:37.044
you’ve got no economy.

474
00:21:37.044 --> 00:21:38.544
The dead don’t pay taxes.

475
00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:41.211
50, actually, there is something
that is a first—order and something

476
00:21:41.211 --> 00:21:44.544
that mayjust be second—order.

477
00:21:44.544 --> 00:21:45.877
So Ijust like...

478
00:21:45.877 --> 00:21:48.877
Having been a nurse that’s
fought through this,

479
00:21:48.877 --> 00:21:51.919
I think it’s important to recognise
that, yes, there are other

480
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:54.461
things, like the economy,
keeping thejobs going,

481
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:57.294
but dead people can’t work.

482
00:21:57.294 --> 00:22:00.502
So, for me, it’s hugely important
that we actually protect

483
00:22:00.502 --> 00:22:02.252
the populations that are vulnerable.

484
00:22:02.252 --> 00:22:03.586
And the other thing...

485
00:22:03.586 --> 00:22:05.752
Does that mean you want
tighter restrictions?

486
00:22:05.752 --> 00:22:10.169
I want people to practise
the restrictions that are out there.

487
00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:12.836
So, you think people are not
obeying them at the moment,

488
00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:14.627
in sufficient numbers?

489
00:22:14.627 --> 00:22:17.919
I spoke to about 100
nurses today and I spoke

490
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:22.377
to others in West Yorkshire,
and, you know, example after example

491
00:22:22.377 --> 00:22:26.669
of people that were not
following the restrictions,

492
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:30.377
actually, and for those nurses,
it was quite heartfelt

493
00:22:30.377 --> 00:22:33.461
because they’d been on the front
line, they’d done their bit,

494
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:36.086
they’d stepped up, they’d worked
more hours, they left their children

495
00:22:36.086 --> 00:22:39.211
and moved out of their homes.

496
00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:44.127
And, so, it’s quite important,
actually, that we don’t lose sight

497
00:22:44.336 --> 00:22:48.627
of the fact that the behaviours
we adopt can help save lives and may

498
00:22:48.627 --> 00:22:52.544
be if it’s not my life
or somebody else’s life,

499
00:22:52.544 --> 00:22:54.877
it could be their own lives.

500
00:22:54.877 --> 00:22:58.252
So let’s not lose sight of the fact
we are in a pandemic,

501
00:22:58.252 --> 00:23:02.836
and we do have to protect lives,
and, yes, of course we need

502
00:23:02.836 --> 00:23:05.419
to protect the economy but,
actually, if you haven’t got life,

503
00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:06.836
you can’t protect the economy.

504
00:23:06.836 --> 00:23:09.961
I’m going to take another question,
but, before I do, wejust wanted

505
00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:12.419
to mention where we will be
in the coming weeks.

506
00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:14.794
We are looking for people
to join our virtual audience

507
00:23:14.794 --> 00:23:15.961
as we have here tonight.

508
00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:17.419
Next week we are in Edinburgh.

509
00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:19.336
The week after that,
we are in Sedgefield,

510
00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:21.502
Tony Blair’s old constituency.

511
00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:25.794
One of the red wall seats that
turned blue at the last election.

512
00:23:25.794 --> 00:23:29.336
So, if you live in either of those
two areas or thereabouts,

513
00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:31.919
around there, get in touch
by going to the Question Time

514
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.627
website, you can follow
the instructions there,

515
00:23:33.627 --> 00:23:35.794
and come and be part
of our virtual audience,

516
00:23:35.794 --> 00:23:37.211
we’d love to hear from you.

517
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:40.586
Let’s hear from one of our virtual
audience now, who is here with us.

518
00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:41.877
Karl Timson.

519
00:23:41.877 --> 00:23:44.711
Hi, Fiona.

520
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:49.086
I’d like to say given the disruption
Covid—19 has had on the public,

521
00:23:49.086 --> 00:23:54.127
and the mixed messages and confusion
between parties, what measures

522
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:59.169
are the government taking
in planning ahead for the future?

523
00:24:03.794 --> 00:24:07.877
And thinking if we have a vaccine
or if we don’t have a vaccine, Karl?

524
00:24:07.877 --> 00:24:12.752
Yes, yes, planning ahead
if we don’t have a vaccine,

525
00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:16.336
what if we don’t find the vaccine
in time before the end of the year,

526
00:24:16.336 --> 00:24:17.877
what is the government’s plan?

527
00:24:17.877 --> 00:24:20.586
So, what is the strategy?

528
00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:23.419
We all know a lot of work’s
being done on the vaccine,

529
00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:26.044
the government supporting it,
you don’t need to tell us that,

530
00:24:26.044 --> 00:24:27.252
but what is the strategy?

531
00:24:27.252 --> 00:24:28.294
Well, we have...

532
00:24:28.294 --> 00:24:29.961
The overall strategy,
and Michael mentioned this,

533
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:33.586
is to try and get the R rate below
one, so that’s what were trying

534
00:24:33.586 --> 00:24:36.461
to do, that’s what were trying to do
in suppressing the cases.

535
00:24:36.461 --> 00:24:41.336
So, Donna’s point is absolutely
very warmly welcome,

536
00:24:41.336 --> 00:24:43.919
and actually from the front line,
from the nurses saying, please,

537
00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:48.002
please follow the rules because,
actually, the best things we can do,

538
00:24:48.002 --> 00:24:51.669
we know a bit more about this
disease now but transmission,

539
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:54.794
it is very easily transmitted
but we can do an awful

540
00:24:54.794 --> 00:24:56.919
lot to stop that.

541
00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:59.086
Really, this hands, face,
space, it isn’t a rhyme,

542
00:24:59.086 --> 00:25:04.127
it’s really serious.

543
00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.127
In terms of what we’re
doing to prepare...

544
00:25:06.127 --> 00:25:08.336
To better prepare, the thing
we’re trying to work

545
00:25:08.336 --> 00:25:10.961
on is obviously the vaccine,
and we have the two groups

546
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:13.211
here that seem to be
leading the way, but,

547
00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:17.836
as you say, that’ll be binary,
it will or won’t work at some point.

548
00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:22.169
In terms of testing,
we’ve got another two streams.

549
00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:25.544
The first is to have a lot more
testing, so, 500,000 tests per day

550
00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:28.419
by the end of this month,
and the moonshot, which is millions

551
00:25:28.419 --> 00:25:32.836
a day in the early next year.

552
00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:35.419
And that really reliess
on the pilots we are doing now

553
00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:37.086
with the rapid testing,
the saliva testing.

554
00:25:37.086 --> 00:25:39.627
There is a number of
different pilots going on.

555
00:25:39.627 --> 00:25:41.961
That, if you can get
to those kinds of tests,

556
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:43.461
it does give you some options...

557
00:25:43.461 --> 00:25:48.419
So, the strategy, then,
is either for a vaccine to come

558
00:25:48.711 --> 00:25:52.252
to the rescue or to have so much
testing in fact that we don’t have

559
00:25:52.252 --> 00:25:54.127
to go into restrictions
one after another?

560
00:25:54.127 --> 00:25:59.169
To live with it in a way you can use
testing effectively so, for example,

561
00:25:59.336 --> 00:26:02.502
for venues you could use a test,
you could have a rapid turnaround,

562
00:26:02.502 --> 00:26:04.836
you could tell if somebody
was negative, they could go

563
00:26:04.836 --> 00:26:05.877
into the venue.

564
00:26:05.877 --> 00:26:07.336
Can I just ask you about...

565
00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:09.044
We are working on those
in parallel...

566
00:26:09.044 --> 00:26:11.377
Let me just ask you about
the vaccine because there

567
00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:14.002
were reports this week that
on a vaccine does come along,

568
00:26:14.002 --> 00:26:16.919
if and when it comes along,
it’ll only be offered to 15%

569
00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:18.127
of the population.

570
00:26:18.127 --> 00:26:19.169
Is that right?

571
00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:21.086
I don’t know where those
reports came from.

572
00:26:21.086 --> 00:26:24.002
Obviously, we will get as much
of the vaccine as we can,

573
00:26:24.002 --> 00:26:25.002
and we’ve secured already...

574
00:26:25.002 --> 00:26:26.752
So, is that right or not right?

575
00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:30.836
I don’t know if that is right or not
right but we will go until we get

576
00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:31.836
the whole population...

577
00:26:31.836 --> 00:26:34.211
This was the head of the vaccine
programme saying that

578
00:26:34.211 --> 00:26:35.669
which is why I am asking.

579
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:36.836
I guess they’d know.

580
00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:39.711
I suppose they would know, I suppose
that’s where they will start.

581
00:26:39.711 --> 00:26:42.836
If you start with a vaccine,
I imagine you’ll go to as many

582
00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:45.127
people who want a vaccine.

583
00:26:45.127 --> 00:26:48.044
It’s not like the vaccine
is going to be sort of depleted

584
00:26:48.044 --> 00:26:49.961
and then there is no
longer any vaccine.

585
00:26:49.961 --> 00:26:51.669
It can be made again.

586
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:54.252
So, you know, Ithink
the question, actually,

587
00:26:54.252 --> 00:26:57.377
is not about the percentage,
it’s about how long it takes to get

588
00:26:57.377 --> 00:26:59.836
enough of the population vaccinated
and also the prioritisation

589
00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:04.127
of the vaccination, which I’m sure
will include some of the more

590
00:27:04.127 --> 00:27:08.877
vulnerable groups that don
are referred to would

591
00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.711
be top of the list.

592
00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:13.086
Donna, where do you think
the government should be going?

593
00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:15.461
BorisJohnson has talked
about having a bumper six months

594
00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:18.086
ahead, none of us really know what’s
going to happen around

595
00:27:18.086 --> 00:27:19.836
Christmas and beyond.

596
00:27:19.836 --> 00:27:24.836
I think if a vaccine comes
along, all well and good.

597
00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:27.669
But, actually, there
is something about us living

598
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:32.586
with the new normal because,
actually, whatever happens now,

599
00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:36.002
we can see that we will suppress
and then we will spike.

600
00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:41.002
If you look at the trajectory today,
we’ve seen is that we all took

601
00:27:41.752 --> 00:27:45.836
really restrictive action,
and the minute we started loosening,

602
00:27:45.836 --> 00:27:49.752
we started to get some spikes.

603
00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:53.336
So, I think we are going to have
to get used to a new norm.

604
00:27:53.336 --> 00:27:57.627
We are going to have to do
the things that we are doing,

605
00:27:57.627 --> 00:27:59.544
like the face, the masks,
the hand washing,

606
00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:01.961
the social distancing.

607
00:28:01.961 --> 00:28:05.044
I think, for us as a people,
it is a new thing we

608
00:28:05.044 --> 00:28:06.502
have to get used to.

609
00:28:06.502 --> 00:28:09.586
Clearly, at some point,
we are going to have to go

610
00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:13.919
back to work and earn,
and have pubs, but, actually,

611
00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:16.836
as we learn more and more
about the virus, it’s been around...

612
00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:19.919
It is relatively young,
really, so I think time

613
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:24.877
will teach us a bit more.

614
00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:29.961
Michael, I mean, as Donna says,
people will have to go back to work,

615
00:28:30.002 --> 00:28:33.086
lots of people are not going to be
able to go back to

616
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:34.127
work at the moment.

617
00:28:34.127 --> 00:28:36.044
Part of the government’s strategies
clearly economy and. ..

618
00:28:36.044 --> 00:28:38.711
Government debt has
passed £2 trillion for

619
00:28:38.711 --> 00:28:41.752
the first time in history.

620
00:28:41.752 --> 00:28:44.127
That’s going to surely
going to be a large part

621
00:28:44.127 --> 00:28:49.127
of the strategy, going forward.

622
00:28:49.169 --> 00:28:51.794
Well, as I said, Ifeel sure
we’re not going back

623
00:28:51.794 --> 00:28:52.836
to total lockdown.

624
00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:57.669
What was quite effective
in controlling the virus was total

625
00:28:57.669 --> 00:29:01.086
lockdown but if I’m right and we’re
not going back to that,

626
00:29:01.086 --> 00:29:03.294
and partial lockdown seems to be
relatively ineffective,

627
00:29:03.294 --> 00:29:07.919
what that implies is we’re going
to live with levels of the virus.

628
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:11.002
What we know is the viruses much
more lethal for certain age groups

629
00:29:11.002 --> 00:29:16.044
and certain sorts of people,
and much less lethal for others.

630
00:29:18.502 --> 00:29:21.086
So, I think there will eventually
emerge a difference of policy

631
00:29:21.086 --> 00:29:23.252
towards people of different age
groups and different vulnerabilities

632
00:29:23.252 --> 00:29:26.127
which will mean that younger people
will be encouraged to go back

633
00:29:26.127 --> 00:29:28.044
to work, and older people
will be protected.

634
00:29:28.044 --> 00:29:33.044
And the protection of the older
people will be partly, I think,

635
00:29:33.044 --> 00:29:35.711
in the hands of individuals,
so if you’re going to visit

636
00:29:35.711 --> 00:29:38.086
your elderly parents,
you want to make sure you’ve been

637
00:29:38.086 --> 00:29:40.461
tested, maybe you’ve been
quarantined for some days before

638
00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:42.836
you go to see your parents,
and, at some levels,

639
00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:44.544
it’ll be institutional.

640
00:29:44.544 --> 00:29:49.086
So, where, for example,
young and old meet is in care homes,

641
00:29:49.086 --> 00:29:52.586
well, young people who go into work
in care homes you have a social

642
00:29:52.586 --> 00:29:55.252
life outside they’re
going to have to be tested,

643
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.752
I’d say, on a daily basis.

644
00:29:57.752 --> 00:30:00.711
We’ve absolutely got to make sure
we maintain that frontier.

645
00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:03.127
So I think, although I don’t
believe this has been

646
00:30:03.127 --> 00:30:05.419
talked about very much,
we will see the emergence

647
00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:07.836
of a strategy which looks very
different from the strategy

648
00:30:07.836 --> 00:30:10.877
we come from.

649
00:30:10.877 --> 00:30:15.169
On your point about the 2 trillion,
at no point as the government or,

650
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:18.419
dare I say, any government anywhere
in the world tried to calculate

651
00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:22.502
what it is worth spending.

652
00:30:22.502 --> 00:30:25.377
We shied away from the question
of what human life is worth.

653
00:30:25.377 --> 00:30:27.961
It’s too dangerous a subject.

654
00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:30.336
Of course, we do do
this in other contexts.

655
00:30:30.336 --> 00:30:33.711
If you’re going to build a bypass,
we say how many lives is going

656
00:30:33.711 --> 00:30:35.377
to save and is it worth doing.

657
00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:36.836
But, in this context, we haven’t.

658
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:39.961
I’m pretty sure that the money we’ve
spent, the ruin that’s been brought,

659
00:30:39.961 --> 00:30:42.627
the mental health issues that have
arisen, the cancellation

660
00:30:42.627 --> 00:30:45.836
of the cancer operations,
the number of people who have

661
00:30:45.836 --> 00:30:48.752
developed other diseases,
the mortality of those people

662
00:30:48.752 --> 00:30:50.669
who haven’t been treated,
I’m pretty sure that

663
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:55.711
all of that is not worth the lives
we may have saved but no one

664
00:30:55.794 --> 00:30:59.002
is willing to calculate that
but I think at some point,

665
00:30:59.002 --> 00:31:03.252
unless the vaccine comes along,
we will have to have a different

666
00:31:03.252 --> 00:31:06.752
approach in which we say this thing
is going to be around,

667
00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:10.336
and we will therefore have to think
about who is able to live with it

668
00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:13.752
and who must be excluded from it,
and how do we protect the barriers

669
00:31:13.752 --> 00:31:16.669
between these two populations.

670
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:20.669
And, Yanis, sitting where
you are in Athens, what’s your take?

671
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:23.877
Well, let me first answer
Karl’s question about

672
00:31:23.877 --> 00:31:27.711
what governments can actually do.

673
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:32.669
The main task is a proper test
and trace regime system.

674
00:31:32.877 --> 00:31:35.502
Unfortunately, BorisJohnson
and our Prime Minister

675
00:31:35.502 --> 00:31:38.836
here during the lockdown made
the far—fetched promises

676
00:31:38.836 --> 00:31:42.669
about world beating superlative
testing and tracing systems

677
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:44.336
and they didn’t deliver.

678
00:31:44.336 --> 00:31:47.127
And that eroded trust
in our governance.

679
00:31:47.127 --> 00:31:52.169
At a time when lives depend
on the maintenance of that trust.

680
00:31:52.336 --> 00:31:54.002
It’s notjust a question of money.

681
00:31:54.002 --> 00:31:55.086
Greece is broke.

682
00:31:55.086 --> 00:31:57.794
Our government...

683
00:31:57.794 --> 00:32:01.627
As you know are hugely indebted,
and they couldn’t put an amount

684
00:32:01.627 --> 00:32:04.836
of money into the testing regime
the United Kingdom did.

685
00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:08.252
But the shambles in
the United Kingdom with the testing

686
00:32:08.252 --> 00:32:12.002
regime proves that it’s notjust
a question of penny pinching.

687
00:32:12.002 --> 00:32:15.836
It’s a question of where
you spend the money.

688
00:32:15.836 --> 00:32:18.544
And this obsession
with subcontracting

689
00:32:18.544 --> 00:32:23.586
to private medical megafirms,
the testing system, which...

690
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:30.336
Is called an "NHS" testing
and tracing system, but it’s not.

691
00:32:30.336 --> 00:32:31.794
It does not involve the NHS.

692
00:32:31.794 --> 00:32:36.086
All the expertise of the NHS is not
part and parcel of this system.

693
00:32:36.086 --> 00:32:39.794
Therefore, you have complete
failure, as one company

694
00:32:39.794 --> 00:32:41.877
subcontracts to another.

695
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:44.336
That’s the answer to Karl.

696
00:32:44.336 --> 00:32:47.002
On the question of the economy,
allow me to say that

697
00:32:47.002 --> 00:32:50.044
I was watching your Chancellor over
the last months, and I thought

698
00:32:50.044 --> 00:32:53.836
he had a pretty good
pandemic until recently.

699
00:32:53.836 --> 00:32:56.711
Then he made this derisory speech
in which, to please a crowd

700
00:32:56.711 --> 00:33:01.211
of Tories, he talked about how
you need to balance the books,

701
00:33:01.211 --> 00:33:05.169
and to end furlough at the end
of October, as you all know better

702
00:33:05.169 --> 00:33:08.836
than me, to replace it
with a feeble job support scheme.

703
00:33:08.836 --> 00:33:12.377
Now, this is not simply
going to create huge uncertainty

704
00:33:12.377 --> 00:33:17.294
in the mind of the most precarious,
the young, the indebted,

705
00:33:18.836 --> 00:33:21.919
those people who are using credit
cards to put food on the table

706
00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:23.002
before the pandemic.

707
00:33:23.002 --> 00:33:25.627
But it is also an act
of vandalism on the United

708
00:33:25.627 --> 00:33:29.336
Kingdom’s public finances.

709
00:33:29.336 --> 00:33:31.752
Because, Fiona, and this
is how I end, however hard

710
00:33:31.752 --> 00:33:33.919
he shrinks public expenditure,
during a period of serious

711
00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:36.086
depression, the tax take
of the Government is going

712
00:33:36.086 --> 00:33:41.044
to be collapsing faster.

713
00:33:42.127 --> 00:33:45.252
And he will not be able
to decrease his spending at a rate

714
00:33:45.252 --> 00:33:48.086
that will catch up with the decrease
in his revenues, without destroying

715
00:33:48.086 --> 00:33:53.086
the Boris Johnson government.

716
00:33:55.169 --> 00:33:59.877
David, you’ve got your hand up?

717
00:33:59.877 --> 00:34:02.836
I think the future strategy
for the Government should not

718
00:34:02.836 --> 00:34:05.294
look at the symptoms,
which is what they are looking

719
00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:07.919
at at the moment, but the actual
diagnosis of the problem.

720
00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:12.919
And I was pleased to see
that there was an announcement,

721
00:34:18.002 --> 00:34:20.836
I think, by the Government
that they are going to spend several

722
00:34:20.836 --> 00:34:23.794
thousand pounds which the local
councils are going to have to employ

723
00:34:23.794 --> 00:34:26.127
marshals and police to really focus
on the true diagnosis,

724
00:34:26.127 --> 00:34:30.002
which is what is the cause
of this problem?

725
00:34:30.002 --> 00:34:32.627
The cause of this problem is that
people are just not...

726
00:34:32.627 --> 00:34:37.669
Some people are just not adhering
to the government guidelines.

727
00:34:40.961 --> 00:34:43.586
The only way this virus goes
from one person to another

728
00:34:43.586 --> 00:34:45.961
is by somebody being within two
metres of each other.

729
00:34:45.961 --> 00:34:48.127
And I think that is what
the Government should

730
00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:51.377
focus its efforts on, quite frankly.

731
00:34:51.377 --> 00:34:52.794
And making people obey
the restrictions,

732
00:34:52.794 --> 00:34:53.836
is what you’re saying?

733
00:34:53.836 --> 00:34:55.502
Yes, you see these people
gallivanting around,

734
00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:58.169
they might be in a minority,
but the only way the

735
00:34:58.169 --> 00:35:00.336
numbers are increasing
is because they are just not

736
00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:05.294
following what the
Government is dictating.

737
00:35:10.752 --> 00:35:13.586
And that is use the mask,
keep two metres apart from each

738
00:35:13.586 --> 00:35:15.086
other and wash your hands regularly.

739
00:35:15.086 --> 00:35:17.752
And if people did that,
this virus just would not grow

740
00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:19.669
and we would be out of the problem.

741
00:35:19.669 --> 00:35:22.252
And if it continues to grow
like this, then the Government

742
00:35:22.252 --> 00:35:24.377
has got to spend money,
as a future strategy,

743
00:35:24.377 --> 00:35:26.586
to employ these people,
marshals or whatever they are,

744
00:35:26.586 --> 00:35:29.502
to refocus on the areas where these
people are breaking the law.

745
00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:32.044
Well, as you are talking, David,
lots of hands going up.

746
00:35:32.044 --> 00:35:33.127
Ben?

747
00:35:33.127 --> 00:35:36.044
I think it is easy to talk
about what the Government’s future

748
00:35:36.044 --> 00:35:37.211
strategy is going to be.

749
00:35:37.211 --> 00:35:39.836
What have they lost the trust
of the public too much?

750
00:35:39.836 --> 00:35:41.836
I suppose that is not
just the Conservatives,

751
00:35:41.836 --> 00:35:44.669
look across party over the last ten
days, Jeremy Corbyn has hosted

752
00:35:44.669 --> 00:35:47.836
a party at his house with ten
people, the SNP MP who got

753
00:35:47.836 --> 00:35:49.961
the train, infected,
all the way back to Scotland.

754
00:35:49.961 --> 00:35:54.877
The SNP MP you are talking
about, Margaret Ferrier?

755
00:35:54.877 --> 00:35:57.294
Yes, I just think that,
regardless of what the future

756
00:35:57.294 --> 00:36:01.211
strategy is, is the trust gone?

757
00:36:01.211 --> 00:36:05.002
I say SNP MP, she has lost the whip,
so she is not an SNP MP

758
00:36:05.002 --> 00:36:06.086
technically speaking.

759
00:36:06.086 --> 00:36:11.044
Laura?

760
00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:13.211
Hi.

761
00:36:13.211 --> 00:36:15.877
Yeah, just on that point before,
I think it’s very difficult,

762
00:36:15.877 --> 00:36:18.294
obviously, for us to protect
what is going to happen.

763
00:36:18.294 --> 00:36:20.461
But to blame the people
when the Government strategy

764
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:22.627
was obviously to open bars
and restaurants, and then

765
00:36:22.627 --> 00:36:24.294
to automatically shut
them down so quickly,

766
00:36:24.294 --> 00:36:26.877
when we know that, as Donna
mentioned, it’s going to spike

767
00:36:26.877 --> 00:36:31.919
and then it’s going to reduce again.

768
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:35.336
I think it’s more about,
has the Government learned

769
00:36:35.336 --> 00:36:37.752
about this latest wave,
or the beginning of this wave,

770
00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.877
if we are, and what do the panel
think about how that has

771
00:36:40.877 --> 00:36:41.877
immediately been handled 7

772
00:36:41.877 --> 00:36:46.919
We are seeing a rise in spike
in cases, I suppose.

773
00:36:51.252 --> 00:36:53.586
Just listening in to
what everybody’s been saying,

774
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:56.711
I think one of the recurring themes
for me is around the communication

775
00:36:56.711 --> 00:36:58.377
of whatever anybody is going to do.

776
00:36:58.377 --> 00:37:00.294
The issue remains how
the information is communicated

777
00:37:00.294 --> 00:37:01.961
to the public, and how people react.

778
00:37:01.961 --> 00:37:06.919
And that’s where we are
seeing the problems.

779
00:37:10.794 --> 00:37:12.919
Because information has been trickle
down to local authorities,

780
00:37:12.919 --> 00:37:15.336
and two newspapers, and people
aren’t able to react effectively.

781
00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:17.961
And that’s when we are getting these
mixed messages and people

782
00:37:17.961 --> 00:37:19.002
behaving differently.

783
00:37:19.002 --> 00:37:20.711
Because people are hearing
at absorbing information

784
00:37:20.711 --> 00:37:22.127
for what it means to them.

785
00:37:22.127 --> 00:37:25.502
And I just think that is something
we all need to work together on.

786
00:37:25.502 --> 00:37:27.877
I should clarify, Jeremy Corbyn
was attending a wake, incidentally,

787
00:37:27.877 --> 00:37:28.919
not hosting a party.

788
00:37:28.919 --> 00:37:31.586
There were more than six people
there, but it wasn’t actually

789
00:37:31.586 --> 00:37:32.794
a party at his home.

790
00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.502
Andy, you were Health
Secretary once.

791
00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:37.294
Karl’s question is about
what measures can the public

792
00:37:37.294 --> 00:37:39.211
expect Government to take,
in particular if a

793
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:40.211
vaccine is not ready.

794
00:37:40.211 --> 00:37:42.502
Would you do?

795
00:37:42.502 --> 00:37:45.336
So, as Gillian said at the start,
it is a serious situation.

796
00:37:45.336 --> 00:37:46.836
It is hard.

797
00:37:46.836 --> 00:37:49.002
I was Health Secretary
when we had swine flu.

798
00:37:49.002 --> 00:37:51.836
I didn’t get everything right.

799
00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:55.461
So, I would acknowledge
all of those things.

800
00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:57.627
Fariah made an excellent
point, that there are too

801
00:37:57.627 --> 00:37:59.002
many mixed messages.

802
00:37:59.002 --> 00:38:01.169
We’re under local restrictions
on the north—west, to stop

803
00:38:01.169 --> 00:38:03.836
gatherings in the home.

804
00:38:03.836 --> 00:38:08.836
I would say this 10pm curfew creates
gatherings in the home,

805
00:38:13.836 --> 00:38:16.877
because it puts everybody out
of the pub at the same time coming

806
00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:21.877
to the supermarket,
and then on to a gathering.

807
00:38:22.336 --> 00:38:24.961
So, they’ve got to decide,
what are they trying to do?

808
00:38:24.961 --> 00:38:27.377
At the evidence behind it,
I think as Fariah said,

809
00:38:27.377 --> 00:38:30.252
and then more will maybe buy
in to what they are doing.

810
00:38:30.252 --> 00:38:32.877
To answer the question
what would I do, I think Michael

811
00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.336
and Yanis have got this right.

812
00:38:34.336 --> 00:38:36.002
The Government strategy,
I’m afraid, has been

813
00:38:36.002 --> 00:38:38.169
to centralise and to privatise,
when it should have

814
00:38:38.169 --> 00:38:39.211
been to localise.

815
00:38:39.211 --> 00:38:41.627
And if they’d done that
at the start, I think

816
00:38:41.627 --> 00:38:44.044
they would have been able
to have a much better

817
00:38:44.044 --> 00:38:45.044
sharing of responsibility.

818
00:38:45.044 --> 00:38:48.419
There are public health teams
and local authorities that have been

819
00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:50.544
bypassed when it comes to testing
and contact tracing.

820
00:38:50.544 --> 00:38:53.336
And just to say, it’s not too late.

821
00:38:53.336 --> 00:38:56.044
We could still change things.

822
00:38:56.044 --> 00:38:58.877
The national Test and Trace system,
the NHS Test and Trace system,

823
00:38:58.877 --> 00:39:01.836
which Yanis rightly said isn’t much
of an NHS system, currently it

824
00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:04.169
reaches three quarters of people
who test positive in Greater

825
00:39:04.169 --> 00:39:05.211
Manchester.

826
00:39:05.211 --> 00:39:10.252
It doesn’t reach a quarter.

827
00:39:10.877 --> 00:39:14.336
And it reaches half of their family
and friends, half of their contacts.

828
00:39:14.336 --> 00:39:16.919
Now, that is not good enough,
going into winter, for us.

829
00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:19.794
And why is it not performing better?

830
00:39:19.794 --> 00:39:24.586
It’s the difference
between a call centre,

831
00:39:24.586 --> 00:39:26.502
disconnected from communities,
or people on the ground

832
00:39:26.502 --> 00:39:28.877
going doorstep to doorstep.

833
00:39:28.877 --> 00:39:33.211
When local teams do it
in Greater Manchester,

834
00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:35.169
there is a much, much
higher success rate.

835
00:39:35.169 --> 00:39:37.919
And that is what I would do
to answer the question.

836
00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:40.294
I would switch resources
from these national contracts,

837
00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:42.919
I would put it, as Michael said,
into local authorities.

838
00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:44.836
I’ve asked Greater Manchester
Police, Greater Manchester Fire,

839
00:39:44.836 --> 00:39:47.044
to help with contact tracing.

840
00:39:47.044 --> 00:39:48.961
To show that we are putting
forward solutions,

841
00:39:48.961 --> 00:39:51.169
we are notjust criticising.

842
00:39:51.169 --> 00:39:55.127
That is what the
government should do.

843
00:39:55.127 --> 00:39:59.002
I am happy to take responsibility
and be held accountable

844
00:39:59.002 --> 00:40:02.211
for improving those contact rates
that we have currently got.

845
00:40:02.211 --> 00:40:07.127
So, we need to fix Test and Trace
before we go into the winter.

846
00:40:07.127 --> 00:40:08.419
But Yanis is right, too.

847
00:40:08.419 --> 00:40:11.794
We need to extend furlough for those
sectors that will be able

848
00:40:11.794 --> 00:40:13.919
to come back anytime soon,
like aviation, like hospitality,

849
00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:16.669
like live events.

850
00:40:16.669 --> 00:40:21.711
That is what we should do.

851
00:40:22.836 --> 00:40:25.669
Because then we will get more buy
in to the Government strategy,

852
00:40:25.669 --> 00:40:27.836
people would feel supported
and we could get through

853
00:40:27.836 --> 00:40:28.836
a difficult winter.

854
00:40:28.836 --> 00:40:31.544
If they don’t do those things,
I think we are looking

855
00:40:31.544 --> 00:40:34.127
at a winter of deep discontent
in the North of England.

856
00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:36.711
Let’s hearfrom Paul O’Donnell.

857
00:40:36.711 --> 00:40:40.294
Yeah, just sort of going off that,
I think it sort of is about that

858
00:40:40.294 --> 00:40:44.627
two—way conversation,
and the conversation is not

859
00:40:44.627 --> 00:40:47.211
just government outwards
to those localised centres,

860
00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:49.627
it is also to ensure that
people like you, Andy,

861
00:40:49.627 --> 00:40:51.544
can have conversations back
and conform their decisions

862
00:40:51.544 --> 00:40:56.586
and make those decisions.

863
00:40:58.377 --> 00:41:00.086
And you have a specific
question, Paul?

864
00:41:00.086 --> 00:41:01.544
Yes, I have.

865
00:41:01.544 --> 00:41:04.169
A lot of musicians and artists took
offence at Rishi Sunak’s

866
00:41:04.169 --> 00:41:05.252
comments this week.

867
00:41:05.252 --> 00:41:07.836
As Coventry prepares for being UK
City of Culture in 2021,

868
00:41:07.836 --> 00:41:10.544
what are the Government going to do
to ensure that independent

869
00:41:10.544 --> 00:41:15.502
artists survive that long?

870
00:41:18.086 --> 00:41:20.877
So, for those of you who are not
aware about the comments

871
00:41:20.877 --> 00:41:23.336
you are referring to,
Paul, Rishi Sunak was on another

872
00:41:23.336 --> 00:41:25.502
channel, he was asked
what the Government would do

873
00:41:25.502 --> 00:41:27.711
for people in the arts,
specifically, who can’t work.

874
00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:30.752
He talked generally about newjob
schemes and said they are a fresh

875
00:41:30.752 --> 00:41:33.669
and new opportunity for people.

876
00:41:33.669 --> 00:41:35.586
Today, the Chancellor denied
he meant that people

877
00:41:35.586 --> 00:41:36.752
in the arts should retrain.

878
00:41:36.752 --> 00:41:39.961
In fact, he said, they
don’t need to retrain.

879
00:41:39.961 --> 00:41:42.127
I mean, Yanis, does it
come back to providing

880
00:41:42.127 --> 00:41:43.836
greater furlough schemes,
greater opportunities for people?

881
00:41:43.836 --> 00:41:48.794
Particularly in the arts,
music and theatre sector?

882
00:41:54.377 --> 00:41:56.794
It’s funny you should ask that,
because we had recently

883
00:41:56.794 --> 00:41:58.461
a debate in Parliament,
in Greece, about

884
00:41:58.461 --> 00:42:00.752
precisely this issue.

885
00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:05.794
And it was our party’s
position that we have

886
00:42:09.336 --> 00:42:12.169
to have a special furlough
for people who are in the arts,

887
00:42:12.169 --> 00:42:14.836
and have been hit twice by the fact
that the theatres,

888
00:42:14.836 --> 00:42:17.419
pubs and music venues have closed
down, while their second job,

889
00:42:17.419 --> 00:42:22.461
or main job, in the service sector
has already been hit.

890
00:42:22.544 --> 00:42:26.919
I think Michael Portillo
might appreciate that

891
00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:28.836
in Parliament I paraphrase slightly
Winston Churchill, saying,

892
00:42:28.836 --> 00:42:31.252
ill fares the people
who fail to salute the arts

893
00:42:31.252 --> 00:42:36.294
with the reverence and delight
which are their due.

894
00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.586
Allow me just to make a point
regarding generally supporting those

895
00:42:46.586 --> 00:42:50.627
that deserve support at the moment.

896
00:42:50.627 --> 00:42:55.586
You know, the Bank of England is
printing mountain ranges of money.

897
00:42:56.377 --> 00:42:59.502
Which it hopes to lend
to the City of London banks,

898
00:42:59.502 --> 00:43:03.002
hopefully so that they pass it
onto business, hoping

899
00:43:03.002 --> 00:43:05.377
that the business will not buy
back their own shares,

900
00:43:05.377 --> 00:43:07.836
but they will, you know,
invest in good qualityjobs.

901
00:43:07.836 --> 00:43:12.794
This chain is not working.

902
00:43:15.461 --> 00:43:18.294
Imagine if the Bank of England did
that which the monetary authorities

903
00:43:18.294 --> 00:43:20.877
of Hong Kong did at the beginning
of lockdown, or what

904
00:43:20.877 --> 00:43:23.544
Australia did in 2009.

905
00:43:23.544 --> 00:43:24.419
This is something where I believe
a lefty like myself

906
00:43:29.627 --> 00:43:30.836
and a Thatcherite can agree.

907
00:43:30.836 --> 00:43:33.711
Because it is an original idea
by Thomas Paine on one hand,

908
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.169
and Milton Friedman on the other.

909
00:43:35.169 --> 00:43:37.836
Imagine if the Bank of England,
instead of passing the money

910
00:43:37.836 --> 00:43:40.461
onto the commercial banks,
were to put it in the bank

911
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:42.377
account of every citizen
of the United Kingdom.

912
00:43:42.377 --> 00:43:45.002
A certain amount of money,
until all boats are lifted up,

913
00:43:45.002 --> 00:43:46.002
including the artists.

914
00:43:46.002 --> 00:43:47.794
Michael Portillo, could
you agree with that?

915
00:43:47.794 --> 00:43:49.669
Well...

916
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:52.002
Yanis is saying you are both
in agreement on that?

917
00:43:52.002 --> 00:43:57.044
No, I don’t dismiss it out of hand.

918
00:43:57.461 --> 00:44:00.627
I mean, we’re all talking about how
we are going to support people,

919
00:44:00.627 --> 00:44:03.419
and we want to support people,
partly so that they can feed

920
00:44:03.419 --> 00:44:06.086
themselves, but partly so they can
spend money on the economy,

921
00:44:06.086 --> 00:44:07.502
which providesjobs for the people.

922
00:44:07.502 --> 00:44:09.461
So I don’t dismiss
it entirely of hand.

923
00:44:09.461 --> 00:44:13.002
I think the other approach
I would have to the arts,

924
00:44:13.002 --> 00:44:15.711
the Government very often asks
the question what can we do,

925
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:18.669
the answer comes back,
we’ve got to close the theatres.

926
00:44:18.669 --> 00:44:21.544
See, if I was a minister,
I think I would say no,

927
00:44:21.544 --> 00:44:24.127
I want to know how I would keep
the theatres open.

928
00:44:24.127 --> 00:44:27.586
What would we have to do
for the theatres to be open.

929
00:44:27.586 --> 00:44:30.419
Actually, having the theatres open,
it seems to be an easier question,

930
00:44:30.419 --> 00:44:33.044
actually, than opening restaurants,
in the sense that you can sit

931
00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:35.544
in a theatre, covered up.

932
00:44:35.544 --> 00:44:39.044
So, whatever the
appropriate covering is.

933
00:44:39.044 --> 00:44:42.127
When you go into a restaurant,
you have to have the covering off,

934
00:44:42.127 --> 00:44:43.377
because you’ve got to eat.

935
00:44:43.377 --> 00:44:46.919
When you go into a theatre,
you don’t have to.

936
00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:50.044
But at the moment, you have to have
fewer people in the theatre,

937
00:44:50.044 --> 00:44:55.044
which makes it a very expensive
production, relative to when you get

938
00:45:01.794 --> 00:45:04.211
relative to when you get money
from people buy tickets.

939
00:45:04.211 --> 00:45:06.377
First of all, I don’t know
whether that’s true.

940
00:45:06.377 --> 00:45:08.544
I don’t know whether if people
were appropriately clothed,

941
00:45:08.544 --> 00:45:11.419
whether they could go to the theatre
and not maintain social distancing.

942
00:45:11.419 --> 00:45:13.336
In any case, I would
want the theatres...

943
00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:15.461
I wouldn’t say the theatres
had to be closed.

944
00:45:15.461 --> 00:45:17.419
I would say the theatres
should be open.

945
00:45:17.419 --> 00:45:20.294
The maximum number of people,
and if it has to be relayed

946
00:45:20.294 --> 00:45:21.919
to another theatre,
where there is another

947
00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:23.002
group of people.

948
00:45:23.002 --> 00:45:25.919
In other words, what we need
to do is to find ways

949
00:45:25.919 --> 00:45:28.044
of making things happen,
not just accept that everything

950
00:45:28.044 --> 00:45:29.252
has to be closed down.

951
00:45:29.252 --> 00:45:31.211
We had the same in
transport, you know?

952
00:45:31.211 --> 00:45:33.836
We were told that only 10% of people
travel, by comparison

953
00:45:33.836 --> 00:45:34.877
with earlier, on transport.

954
00:45:34.877 --> 00:45:36.336
That’s not a good enough answer.

955
00:45:36.336 --> 00:45:39.419
The question is, how do you get 100%
of people back on transport?

956
00:45:39.419 --> 00:45:42.086
What is it that we need to do,
scientifically, with people

957
00:45:42.086 --> 00:45:44.752
in power or whatever,
to get back to where we were?

958
00:45:44.752 --> 00:45:47.336
Laura, you had your hand up?

959
00:45:47.336 --> 00:45:50.252
Hi, yeah, just on this point
as well, I happen to live

960
00:45:50.252 --> 00:45:51.336
in Stratford—upon—Avon.

961
00:45:51.336 --> 00:45:53.294
Obviously the announcement
of the RSC closing two

962
00:45:53.294 --> 00:45:55.877
of its theatres until 2022,
thatjust has a massive knock—on

963
00:45:55.877 --> 00:45:57.336
on the local economy as well.

964
00:45:57.336 --> 00:46:00.919
So, we need to find a way to support
the arts in order for these

965
00:46:00.919 --> 00:46:02.127
businesses to continue to thrive.

966
00:46:02.127 --> 00:46:05.002
So, it was just really around that,
a comment around that, really.

967
00:46:05.002 --> 00:46:06.044
Amy?

968
00:46:06.044 --> 00:46:11.086
Hello.

969
00:46:17.294 --> 00:46:19.877
A lot of people turn to the arts
when lockdown happened.

970
00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:22.294
And Ifeel like they’ve kind
of been forgotten about.

971
00:46:22.294 --> 00:46:24.419
White background you think
they should get more support?

972
00:46:24.419 --> 00:46:25.502
Yeah, definitely.

973
00:46:25.502 --> 00:46:27.544
Steve 7

974
00:46:27.544 --> 00:46:30.627
50, further to Donna’s comments
about it being a new norm,

975
00:46:30.627 --> 00:46:35.586
why don’t we consider a new economic
policy, and universal income?

976
00:46:38.544 --> 00:46:40.877
That would benefit all,
notjust those in the arts,

977
00:46:40.877 --> 00:46:42.586
but raising everybody up,
and perhaps kick—starting

978
00:46:42.586 --> 00:46:47.627
the economy that way?

979
00:46:51.294 --> 00:46:52.961
And, Paul O’Donnell,
you asked this question.

980
00:46:52.961 --> 00:46:56.086
Forgive me, I should know this
but do you work in the arts?

981
00:46:56.086 --> 00:46:57.794
Yes, so I am a theatre maker.

982
00:46:57.794 --> 00:46:59.919
I tour up and down the country,
and internationally

983
00:46:59.919 --> 00:47:01.127
when I get a chance.

984
00:47:01.127 --> 00:47:04.002
So how has all this affected you,
have you had any work,

985
00:47:04.002 --> 00:47:05.919
are you benefiting
from any of the money

986
00:47:05.919 --> 00:47:07.419
the government has had to offer?

987
00:47:07.419 --> 00:47:09.836
I was lucky enough to get
the self—employed income support

988
00:47:09.836 --> 00:47:12.169
but I understand that the theatre
industry, the sector,

989
00:47:12.169 --> 00:47:15.461
hasn’t been so fortunate in that.

990
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:20.252
70% of the industry are freelancers
and I think only about 30% of them

991
00:47:20.252 --> 00:47:23.627
in theatre were eligible for that
support so there is a lot of people

992
00:47:23.627 --> 00:47:27.877
in the industry who haven’t had any
income for seven months.

993
00:47:27.877 --> 00:47:32.544
And now we’ve got to this
point in the crossroads,

994
00:47:32.544 --> 00:47:35.627
when the self employed income
support is ending and it feels

995
00:47:35.627 --> 00:47:38.169
to the industry very much
like government is sort

996
00:47:38.169 --> 00:47:43.211
of approaching it with the deal
with that approach, and telling us

997
00:47:43.544 --> 00:47:46.836
there isn’t going to be any further
support the industry.

998
00:47:46.836 --> 00:47:51.836
And, importantly, for the artists
that are working with it,

999
00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:57.169
and I mean artists as in designers,
technicians...

1000
00:47:57.169 --> 00:47:58.836
..anybody that works around
the theatre, they’ve

1001
00:47:58.836 --> 00:48:02.377
all been affected by this.

1002
00:48:02.377 --> 00:48:06.169
So, Gillian, Rishi Sunak was very
keen to make it clear today

1003
00:48:06.169 --> 00:48:08.544
that he explicitly was not
suggesting that people who work

1004
00:48:08.544 --> 00:48:12.711
in the arts should retrain.

1005
00:48:12.711 --> 00:48:15.294
But if they can’t work,
what are they supposed to do?

1006
00:48:15.294 --> 00:48:18.419
It is important to say what Rishi
was saying because, actually...

1007
00:48:18.419 --> 00:48:21.586
Well, I’m just quoting
what he said today.

1008
00:48:21.586 --> 00:48:24.502
He said specifically he was very
clear, these are his words,

1009
00:48:24.502 --> 00:48:27.627
that he doesn’t, he’s not saying
these people should retrain.

1010
00:48:27.627 --> 00:48:31.836
So, given that, how does
he expect to get by?

1011
00:48:31.836 --> 00:48:34.544
We had Nicola Benedetti yesterday,
the violinist, she had

1012
00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:39.294
people out in Parliament.

1013
00:48:39.294 --> 00:48:44.336
Of course, the arts are important,
everybody loves the arts,

1014
00:48:45.002 --> 00:48:47.127
they are a massive export,
they are a massive

1015
00:48:47.127 --> 00:48:48.169
differentiator for our country.

1016
00:48:48.169 --> 00:48:49.502
And they are hugely important.

1017
00:48:49.502 --> 00:48:52.336
That’s why there has been a package
of £1.57 billion on top

1018
00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:55.002
of the furlough self
employment schemes, etc.

1019
00:48:55.002 --> 00:48:57.419
Nobody is saying at all,
and the Chancellor hasn’t said

1020
00:48:57.419 --> 00:49:02.377
that there is no support
for anything forever.

1021
00:49:02.919 --> 00:49:04.586
He’s basically said
he keeps everything under

1022
00:49:04.586 --> 00:49:07.086
review, we know that.

1023
00:49:07.086 --> 00:49:10.502
But I want to say something that
I think we’ve lost the focus on.

1024
00:49:10.502 --> 00:49:14.086
This has not been an even economic
disruption with the coronavirus.

1025
00:49:14.086 --> 00:49:17.586
More than half of our economy
is actually growing massively.

1026
00:49:17.586 --> 00:49:20.669
So, if you’re in health, if you’re
in food, if you’re in IT...

1027
00:49:20.669 --> 00:49:22.586
Hang on, you are way
off the question!

1028
00:49:22.586 --> 00:49:25.252
Hang on a minute, Paul’s question
is what are the government...

1029
00:49:25.252 --> 00:49:26.877
It is important to
answer the question.

1030
00:49:26.877 --> 00:49:29.586
What are the government going to do
to ensure that independent

1031
00:49:29.586 --> 00:49:31.502
artists survive that long,
as Coventry, because we’ve

1032
00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:33.669
got our audience from Coventry,
prepare for UK city

1033
00:49:33.669 --> 00:49:35.169
of culture in 2021?

1034
00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:38.086
So, what is the government
going to do to ensure that people

1035
00:49:38.086 --> 00:49:42.419
like Paul and others do survive that
long if they are not...

1036
00:49:42.419 --> 00:49:44.336
Clearly, the Chancellor doesn’t
want them to retrain,

1037
00:49:44.336 --> 00:49:46.002
what do you think they should do?

1038
00:49:46.002 --> 00:49:49.169
£1.57 billion has gone
into rescuing the arts...

1039
00:49:49.169 --> 00:49:50.877
That’s to organisations,
not to individual artists.

1040
00:49:50.877 --> 00:49:53.836
They haven’t worked out yet how it’s
all going to go through,

1041
00:49:53.836 --> 00:49:56.752
so it is going through a number
of different routes.

1042
00:49:56.752 --> 00:49:59.127
I don’t know, they are organising
themselves how that happens,

1043
00:49:59.127 --> 00:50:02.086
I don’t know any more
detail on that.

1044
00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:05.252
There is many sectors
who haven’t had that support.

1045
00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:09.836
The arts has had that support
plus the other schemes are there.

1046
00:50:09.836 --> 00:50:13.461
Of course, we are not going to sit
here and let all of our arts

1047
00:50:13.461 --> 00:50:16.377
or all of our culture,
everything, disappear

1048
00:50:16.377 --> 00:50:18.711
so we’ve got nothing left.

1049
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:22.002
We are there to support which is why
that has been put in place.

1050
00:50:22.002 --> 00:50:24.461
And I know the Culture Secretary
is talking about sports...

1051
00:50:24.461 --> 00:50:27.127
There is many, many sectors,
you could apply this

1052
00:50:27.127 --> 00:50:31.377
question to many sectors.

1053
00:50:31.377 --> 00:50:34.002
What I was wanting to say,
and I think is important,

1054
00:50:34.002 --> 00:50:36.169
is the first six weeks
of apprenticeships and skills

1055
00:50:36.169 --> 00:50:40.169
minister, every meeting I had
was about massive skill shortages

1056
00:50:40.169 --> 00:50:42.419
in this economy.

1057
00:50:42.419 --> 00:50:44.836
Hundreds of thousands of skill
shortages in nursing, mental health,

1058
00:50:44.836 --> 00:50:46.752
social care, engineering...

1059
00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:48.669
So, do you think they
should retrain, then?

1060
00:50:48.669 --> 00:50:52.544
There is many opportunities
for people to retrain.

1061
00:50:52.544 --> 00:50:54.711
I’m not saying, because this
is where people say

1062
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:56.836
I don’t want to retrain.

1063
00:50:56.836 --> 00:50:59.502
It isn’t forcing people to retrain.

1064
00:50:59.502 --> 00:51:02.836
It’s just saying if you are a young
person or if you are looking

1065
00:51:02.836 --> 00:51:05.002
for your second career,
this is my second career

1066
00:51:05.002 --> 00:51:07.669
because I’ve been in business for 30
years, if you’re looking

1067
00:51:07.669 --> 00:51:09.836
for something different to do,
there are many opportunities.

1068
00:51:09.836 --> 00:51:11.836
We’ve got many skill shortages.

1069
00:51:11.836 --> 00:51:13.919
And that’s why we’ve
put a big announcement

1070
00:51:13.919 --> 00:51:17.461
togetherfor adult skills,
to help people to retrain,

1071
00:51:17.461 --> 00:51:19.919
to make it much more easy.

1072
00:51:19.919 --> 00:51:22.794
Some people want a second career.

1073
00:51:22.794 --> 00:51:25.919
They’ve been working for a long time
now and it can be right.

1074
00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:29.211
I’ve met many people who have been
made redundant in the past

1075
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:31.836
to use this to retrain,
to go into nursing, for example,

1076
00:51:31.836 --> 00:51:34.752
that they wanted to do from school
but never got the opportunity.

1077
00:51:34.752 --> 00:51:38.044
So, it is an important message.

1078
00:51:38.044 --> 00:51:39.961
Donna, you’re not looking
too chuffed with that.

1079
00:51:39.961 --> 00:51:42.419
The government is saying it’s
going to get 50,000 more

1080
00:51:42.419 --> 00:51:43.627
nurses, maybe this is how?

1081
00:51:43.627 --> 00:51:44.627
I’d be delighted!

1082
00:51:44.627 --> 00:51:46.627
I’m not looking unhappy,
I’d be delighted.

1083
00:51:46.627 --> 00:51:50.211
As I said, first of all, nursing,
you have to want to be a nurse.

1084
00:51:50.211 --> 00:51:53.044
And it is a lot of hard
work to be a nurse.

1085
00:51:53.044 --> 00:51:55.544
We are 50...

1086
00:51:55.544 --> 00:51:59.544
We started this pandemic
50,000 nurses short,

1087
00:51:59.544 --> 00:52:02.627
and we are 50,000 nurses short
because nurses is treated

1088
00:52:02.627 --> 00:52:05.002
as a vocation, it’s not been paid
properly, we’ve stepped

1089
00:52:05.002 --> 00:52:08.627
up, we’ve served.

1090
00:52:08.627 --> 00:52:11.627
So there’s going to have
to be much more thanjust

1091
00:52:11.627 --> 00:52:13.086
saying retrain because,
actually, people want

1092
00:52:13.086 --> 00:52:15.877
a good quality of life.

1093
00:52:15.877 --> 00:52:17.836
And that includes paying people
properly and recognising

1094
00:52:17.836 --> 00:52:20.544
their skills and value.

1095
00:52:20.544 --> 00:52:22.919
What do you think of government
suggestions that we’ve heard

1096
00:52:22.919 --> 00:52:25.544
about people who work in cinemas,
for example, or cabin crew,

1097
00:52:25.544 --> 00:52:29.211
could retrain and work in the care
sector, is it a goer?

1098
00:52:29.211 --> 00:52:33.002
It might be, if you can acquire
the skills and education,

1099
00:52:33.002 --> 00:52:38.002
and you’ve got the ability to be
a nurse or a carer, I think...

1100
00:52:38.711 --> 00:52:41.336
I’m not going to say it isn’t
a goer, because there

1101
00:52:41.336 --> 00:52:43.336
is a shortage of nurses,
we know that.

1102
00:52:43.336 --> 00:52:48.336
However, it is still
a complex skill.

1103
00:52:48.586 --> 00:52:51.669
You’ve seen how we’ve battled
on the front line, and we are about.

1104
00:52:51.669 --> 00:52:53.836
We did a survey recently,
37% said they wanted

1105
00:52:53.836 --> 00:52:54.836
to leave the profession.

1106
00:52:54.836 --> 00:52:57.502
50, actually, isn’t as easy
as retraining to be a nurse.

1107
00:52:57.502 --> 00:53:00.711
It is actually quite a hardcore
career with 37% said we’ve been

1108
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:05.711
through the pandemic,
we’ve seen enough death,

1109
00:53:06.544 --> 00:53:10.377
thanks, we want to be off.

1110
00:53:10.377 --> 00:53:12.294
Gillian is right.

1111
00:53:12.294 --> 00:53:14.961
The government have put a lot
of support in different ways.

1112
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:17.669
Of course they have.

1113
00:53:17.669 --> 00:53:20.294
But to answer Paul’s question why
are people in the arts

1114
00:53:20.294 --> 00:53:24.544
still kind of speaking out,
I think there’s two reasons why.

1115
00:53:24.544 --> 00:53:28.502
The first is many people who work
in the arts are self—employed

1116
00:53:28.502 --> 00:53:31.794
or freelancers and the truth
is the Chancellor never gave those

1117
00:53:31.794 --> 00:53:35.544
people enough support.

1118
00:53:35.544 --> 00:53:37.211
They were missed out back in April.

1119
00:53:37.211 --> 00:53:39.377
There was a support scheme
for the self employed.

1120
00:53:39.377 --> 00:53:41.127
There was but it
didn’t reach anybody.

1121
00:53:41.127 --> 00:53:46.002
People who were newly
self—employed didn’t get support,

1122
00:53:46.002 --> 00:53:48.752
they missed out low—paid company
directors was another group.

1123
00:53:48.752 --> 00:53:51.086
So it never was the case that
everybody got support.

1124
00:53:51.086 --> 00:53:53.752
Some people were missed
many of them work in the arts.

1125
00:53:53.752 --> 00:53:58.794
The second reason I think people
like Paul are feeling

1126
00:53:58.836 --> 00:54:01.419
frustrated this week is it’s
as if the government are making

1127
00:54:01.419 --> 00:54:03.836
a judgment about somejobs
are viable and some jobs

1128
00:54:03.836 --> 00:54:06.877
are not viable.

1129
00:54:06.877 --> 00:54:09.544
And they are always putting
the arts into the not viable

1130
00:54:09.544 --> 00:54:10.961
category and encouraging
people to retrain.

1131
00:54:10.961 --> 00:54:15.044
There is no doubt at all in my mind
that if the support is put in now

1132
00:54:15.044 --> 00:54:17.211
to keep people going,
the arts will come roaring

1133
00:54:17.211 --> 00:54:20.086
back at the end of this,
as will other sectors as well,

1134
00:54:20.086 --> 00:54:24.377
who simply cannot function properly
at this moment in time.

1135
00:54:24.377 --> 00:54:26.794
And I think that’s what people
are getting frustrated about,

1136
00:54:26.794 --> 00:54:29.669
as though the arts ran just be sort
of left to go.

1137
00:54:29.669 --> 00:54:32.669
Because, for us, the arts
are the lifeblood of Manchester.

1138
00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:37.086
The city thrives on the
institutions we’ve got.

1139
00:54:37.086 --> 00:54:40.002
And I put this to people —
if we come through this,

1140
00:54:40.002 --> 00:54:43.377
and to come through this crisis
and we look up and the theatres have

1141
00:54:43.377 --> 00:54:46.669
closed, and our music venues have
closed, and everything else we love

1142
00:54:46.669 --> 00:54:50.669
has gone, then Covid
will have won, basically.

1143
00:54:50.669 --> 00:54:54.252
Let me take a very quick question
in the time we have left from Jenny.

1144
00:54:54.252 --> 00:54:56.086
Hi.

1145
00:54:56.086 --> 00:55:00.502
My question is will Donald Trump
get the sympathy vote?

1146
00:55:00.502 --> 00:55:03.086
After of course he has
contracted coronavirus,

1147
00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:05.377
is what you’re referring to,
jenny.

1148
00:55:05.377 --> 00:55:07.294
It’s been interesting
to watch from over here,

1149
00:55:07.294 --> 00:55:08.961
from over this side of the Atlantic.

1150
00:55:08.961 --> 00:55:10.544
Michael?

1151
00:55:10.544 --> 00:55:13.711
The immediate reaction in the poll
seems to have been adverse

1152
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:16.669
for Donald Trump which I must say
is slightly surprising.

1153
00:55:16.669 --> 00:55:21.711
I have a feeling, reading
the American public as best I can,

1154
00:55:22.294 --> 00:55:25.919
that there will be a bit
of a resurgence in Trump support

1155
00:55:25.919 --> 00:55:30.961
and that there will be a little bit
of a closing of the gap with Biden.

1156
00:55:31.169 --> 00:55:35.669
I think a big mistake has been made
today allowing Trump effectively

1157
00:55:35.669 --> 00:55:39.502
to pull out of the next debate
because they changed the rules.

1158
00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.502
They were going to make it virtual.

1159
00:55:41.502 --> 00:55:45.169
However, at this stage,
it looks as though the gap

1160
00:55:45.169 --> 00:55:50.127
between Trump and Biden is too great
to cover in the remaining days

1161
00:55:50.252 --> 00:55:54.836
before the election.

1162
00:55:54.836 --> 00:55:57.961
So I’d expect a closer result
than the polls are suggesting

1163
00:55:57.961 --> 00:56:00.586
at the moment but probably none
the less 3 Biden victory.

1164
00:56:00.586 --> 00:56:05.627
Gillian, Donald Trump
described his contracting

1165
00:56:06.336 --> 00:56:08.502
coronavirus as a blessing,
as a gift from God.

1166
00:56:08.502 --> 00:56:12.294
Was it a gift from God
for BorisJohnson?

1167
00:56:12.294 --> 00:56:14.461
I certainly don’t think he’d
describe it like that.

1168
00:56:14.461 --> 00:56:17.086
In fact, I don’t think he has
described it like that!

1169
00:56:17.086 --> 00:56:20.211
You know, there is a serious point,
actually, that there is a lot

1170
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:23.086
of people living with long Covid
which can affect anyone at any

1171
00:56:23.086 --> 00:56:25.294
age, and we don’t talk
about that nearly enough.

1172
00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:27.919
So anybody who thinks that,
you know, letting the cases rip

1173
00:56:27.919 --> 00:56:29.627
and carrying on is a good idea...

1174
00:56:29.627 --> 00:56:32.461
So do you think Donald Trump
was wrong to say that, then?

1175
00:56:32.461 --> 00:56:34.127
Do you think he has
behaved irresponsibly?

1176
00:56:34.127 --> 00:56:35.169
Imean...

1177
00:56:35.169 --> 00:56:36.836
Come on, Gillian,
say what you think!

1178
00:56:36.836 --> 00:56:40.586
Donald Trump, I mean...

1179
00:56:40.586 --> 00:56:43.044
As for the election,
I think most people have decided.

1180
00:56:43.044 --> 00:56:48.086
It’s so polarised, it’s
an unbelievably polarised society

1181
00:56:48.502 --> 00:56:52.086
and I think will he get
the sympathy vote?

1182
00:56:52.086 --> 00:56:55.461
I very much doubt it but,
do I think he’s been blessed and God

1183
00:56:55.461 --> 00:56:56.627
has given him the answer?

1184
00:56:56.627 --> 00:56:57.919
Not necessarily, no.

1185
00:56:57.919 --> 00:56:59.836
He is lucky to have
survived it without...

1186
00:56:59.836 --> 00:57:03.711
It seems to be very low symptom, so,
for that, he will be thankful but it

1187
00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:07.794
doesn’t mean his case is going to be
the same for everybody else’s case,

1188
00:57:07.794 --> 00:57:11.127
which is kind of what he might be
saying, if you take this drug,

1189
00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:13.877
everybody, it’s nothing
to worry about.

1190
00:57:13.877 --> 00:57:16.294
That is completely wrong.

1191
00:57:16.294 --> 00:57:18.377
You think is wrong to say that?

1192
00:57:18.377 --> 00:57:21.711
I think it is wrong because Donna
will tell you, she knows much more

1193
00:57:21.711 --> 00:57:24.627
than I do but Long Cove it does
exist, it affects people

1194
00:57:24.627 --> 00:57:27.461
in different ways, different
age groups as well,

1195
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:28.919
and it is very debilitating.

1196
00:57:28.919 --> 00:57:33.086
How do you think he’s handled it?

1197
00:57:33.086 --> 00:57:36.169
My advice to Donald Trump would be
to isolate and follow the rules...

1198
00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:38.544
For a long time!

1199
00:57:38.544 --> 00:57:40.919
Isolate, follow the rules,
and I’m not sure Donald Trump

1200
00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:45.919
would be anybody I’d be listening
to pronouncing on Covid.

1201
00:57:46.544 --> 00:57:47.877
Well, right, you heard it here!

1202
00:57:47.877 --> 00:57:49.252
Andy?

1203
00:57:49.252 --> 00:57:52.836
I think that is brilliant advice!

1204
00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:55.502
If he could isolate beyond November,
whatever the election date is,

1205
00:57:55.502 --> 00:57:58.127
that would be even better
but to answerJenny’s question, how

1206
00:57:58.127 --> 00:58:03.127
can you have sympathy for somebody
who is still infectious,

1207
00:58:06.752 --> 00:58:10.836
but drags security staff on a drive
around for his own purposes?

1208
00:58:10.836 --> 00:58:14.461
How could you have sympathy
for someone who does that?

1209
00:58:14.461 --> 00:58:17.044
for somebody who’s made a virtue

1210
00:58:17.044 --> 00:58:19.461
of not wearing a mask all year,
holding rallies without

1211
00:58:19.461 --> 00:58:21.419
social distancing?

1212
00:58:21.419 --> 00:58:24.211
Somebody said rightly before that
politicians need to lead

1213
00:58:24.211 --> 00:58:27.336
by example through this
and through their actions

1214
00:58:27.336 --> 00:58:28.377
do the right thing.

1215
00:58:28.377 --> 00:58:32.294
That’s what the job brings with it,
that’s what you should do.

1216
00:58:32.294 --> 00:58:36.836
And he’s done the complete opposite
and he put his own health at risk

1217
00:58:36.836 --> 00:58:39.419
but he actually has put the health
of millions of Americans

1218
00:58:39.419 --> 00:58:40.586
at risk through this.

1219
00:58:40.586 --> 00:58:44.461
So, I’ll make it plain,
I’ve no sympathy for him whatsoever.

1220
00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:47.336
Ijust hope and I think
the world would be a better

1221
00:58:47.336 --> 00:58:50.461
place if he is removed
with a landslide next month.

1222
00:58:50.461 --> 00:58:54.127
I think we will begin to get better
politics around the world.

1223
00:58:54.127 --> 00:58:55.919
We’ve had to pandemics, haven’t we?

1224
00:58:55.919 --> 00:58:58.627
This year, Covid
we have talked about.

1225
00:58:58.627 --> 00:59:01.836
But we’ve had a pandemic
growing over the last

1226
00:59:01.836 --> 00:59:04.961
decade of xenophobia,
nationalism, discrimination,

1227
00:59:04.961 --> 00:59:07.627
hate, and we’ve seen that
come to a head this year

1228
00:59:07.627 --> 00:59:10.211
on the streets of Minneapolis.

1229
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:15.169
This world, in my view,
it needs a big correction.

1230
00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:19.211
We need to come out of this
with a very different mindset.

1231
00:59:19.211 --> 00:59:22.336
And Ijust think, you know,
it starts, I hope, with the removal

1232
00:59:22.336 --> 00:59:27.336
of Donald Trump next month.

1233
00:59:33.461 --> 00:59:35.877
Yanis, do you think he will
get the sympathy vote?

1234
00:59:35.877 --> 00:59:38.294
I agree with Andy that it is
impossible to sympathise

1235
00:59:38.294 --> 00:59:40.461
with somebody like Donald Trump
but where I disagree

1236
00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:42.836
is with the premise
of the question, if I may.

1237
00:59:42.836 --> 00:59:44.044
Donald Trump doesn’t do sympathy.

1238
00:59:44.044 --> 00:59:45.711
He doesn’t follow the
politics of sympathy.

1239
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:46.919
He doesn’t trade on sympathy.

1240
00:59:46.919 --> 00:59:47.961
He doesn’t want sympathy.

1241
00:59:47.961 --> 00:59:51.419
He trades on envy, on discontent,
on anger, which he manipulates

1242
00:59:51.419 --> 00:59:54.336
magnificently, as we have seen.

1243
00:59:54.336 --> 00:59:55.919
You saw what he’s like.

1244
00:59:55.919 --> 01:00:00.669
He hasn’t asked for his supporters
sympathy, he asked for their envy!

1245
01:00:00.669 --> 01:00:02.877
Look at how great I am!

1246
01:00:02.877 --> 01:00:05.836
I even managed to defeat Covid
with the help of medicine!

1247
01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:09.919
And I will give you
the stuff for free.

1248
01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:12.627
This is where we are.

1249
01:00:12.627 --> 01:00:17.461
Where we have been since 2016,
perhaps a bit earlier than that.

1250
01:00:17.461 --> 01:00:21.877
We have created circumstances
of austerity for the many,

1251
01:00:21.877 --> 01:00:25.586
and socialism for the financiers.

1252
01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:29.336
That created discontent
at an industrial scale

1253
01:00:29.336 --> 01:00:32.461
and people like Trump,
Bolsanaro, Mohdi, Le Pen, Salvini,

1254
01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:34.794
Orban and so on trade on this.

1255
01:00:34.794 --> 01:00:38.127
They don’t want our sympathy.

1256
01:00:38.127 --> 01:00:41.002
What we need to do, we must change
the circumstances that beget

1257
01:00:41.002 --> 01:00:45.752
the energy that feeds them.

1258
01:00:45.752 --> 01:00:49.002
0K, we are I’m afraid out of time.

1259
01:00:49.002 --> 01:00:51.627
I can see a few of you
have your hands up.

1260
01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:55.294
A few are applauding as well.

1261
01:00:55.294 --> 01:00:58.127
If you were actually here,
we’d be able to hear but thank

1262
01:00:58.127 --> 01:00:59.377
you very much for that.

1263
01:00:59.377 --> 01:01:01.502
Tonight our questions came
from Coventry, as we saw.

1264
01:01:01.502 --> 01:01:04.127
Next week, as I said earlier,
we will be in Edinburgh

1265
01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.044
with the Scottish Government finance
secretary, Kate Frobes,

1266
01:01:06.044 --> 01:01:07.961
and the new leader of
the Scottish Conservatives,

1267
01:01:07.961 --> 01:01:09.002
Doug Ross.

1268
01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:10.711
The following week,
we are in Sedgefield,

1269
01:01:10.711 --> 01:01:12.836
where Nobel prize—winning economist
Joseph Stiglitz will be giving

1270
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.544
us his take on what’s going on.

1271
01:01:14.544 --> 01:01:16.919
And you can apply to be
in our virtual audience,

1272
01:01:16.919 --> 01:01:19.586
go to the Question Time website
and follow the instructions there.

1273
01:01:19.586 --> 01:01:22.711
Adrian Chiles, as always, is coming
up on 5 Live with his guests

1274
01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:25.586
on Question Time Extra Time,
and you can see on screen how

1275
01:01:25.586 --> 01:01:27.377
to get in touch with that.

1276
01:01:29.544 --> 01:01:32.419
But, for now, just say thank
you very much to the panel

1277
01:01:32.419 --> 01:01:33.461
for coming here tonight.

1278
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:35.877
Yanis, thank you very much
forjoining us from Athens.

1279
01:01:35.877 --> 01:01:37.836
And, of course, all our
audience in Coventry,

1280
01:01:37.836 --> 01:01:40.169
thank you for being part of this
programme, really appreciate

1281
01:01:40.169 --> 01:01:41.669
you being able to do that.

1282
01:01:41.669 --> 01:01:43.294
Of course, you at home for watching.

1283
01:01:43.294 --> 01:01:45.961
Thank you very much
from Question Time, bye—bye.

1284
01:02:14.502 --> 01:02:18.002
I don’t want to even want to speak.
This music’s way too smooth.

1285
01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:20.419
But how can sound waves physically
make you move?

1286
01:02:20.419 --> 01:02:24.336
And in return, you get experiences
you like. It lifts you high.

01:02:41.919 --> 01:02:43.836
I’ve always been fascinated

1293
01:02:43.836 --> 01:02:46.836
by family history because
we haven’t necessarily always had

1294
01:02:46.836 --> 01:02:48.127
the people you could ask.

1295
01:02:48.127 --> 01:02:50.336
Oh, my gosh, he was a gravedigger.

1296
01:02:50.336 --> 01:02:51.461
Brutal.

We lost the showman tradition
in ourfamily. Mmm. Mmm.

1298
01:02:54.461 --> 01:02:57.127
You’re back in it. Very kind of you
to call me a showman.

1299
01:02:57.127 --> 01:02:58.544
I’m quite rarely speechless,

1300
01:02:58.544 --> 01:03:00.002
but I’m almost speechless.

01:04:26.752 --> 01:04:28.502
floating around the Government,
around the Cabinet table, between

1325
01:04:28.502 --> 01:04:30.836
around the Cabinet table, between
government departments. Versions of

1326
01:04:30.836 --> 01:04:32.669
government departments. Versions of
it being leaked, consulting with

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:32.836
it being leaked, consulting with
pub“:

1328
01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:34.461
it being leaked, consulting with
public health experts, but not quite

1329
01:04:34.461 --> 01:04:36.419
public health experts, but not quite
there yet. It’s about a new system

1330
01:04:36.419 --> 01:04:36.794
there yet. It’s about a new system
for [oral

1331
01:04:36.794 --> 01:04:38.086
there yet. It’s about a new system
for local restrictions in England to

1332
01:04:38.086 --> 01:04:38.669
for [oral restrictions in England to
deal

1333
01:04:38.669 --> 01:04:39.794
for local restrictions in England to
deal with coronavirus. Absolutely

1334
01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:41.211
deal with coronavirus. Absolutely
right. The reason for that is the

1335
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.502
right. The reason for that is the
view in government is that we are at

1336
01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:44.419
view in government is that we are at
a genuine cmnch

1337
01:04:44.419 --> 01:04:46.002
view in government is that we are at
a genuine crunch point. Another big

1338
01:04:46.002 --> 01:04:47.836
a genuine crunch point. Another big
rise in cases today. More than

1339
01:04:47.836 --> 01:04:49.211
rise in cases today. More than
17,000. The thing they are really

1340
01:04:49.211 --> 01:04:51.002
17,000. The thing they are really
worried about is rising hospital

1341
01:04:51.002 --> 01:04:52.836
worried about is rising hospital
admissions. I am sure we will talk

1342
01:04:52.836 --> 01:04:55.294
admissions. I am sure we will talk
about that later. Over the last 72

1343
01:04:55.294 --> 01:04:57.502
about that later. Over the last 72
hours, there has been, shall we say,

1344
01:04:57.502 --> 01:05:01.252
hours, there has been, shall we say,
plans that have been on again,

1345
01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:02.461
plans that have been on again,
on-again,

1346
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:03.127
plans that have been on again,
on—again, off—again, on—again,

1347
01:05:03.127 --> 01:05:03.544
on-again, off-again, on-again,
off-again.

1348
01:05:03.544 --> 01:05:04.377
on—again, off—again, on—again,
off—again. Someone senior in

1349
01:05:04.377 --> 01:05:04.586
off-again. Someone senior in
government

1350
01:05:04.586 --> 01:05:06.544
off—again. Someone senior in
government said the polite way of

1351
01:05:06.544 --> 01:05:08.544
government said the polite way of
describing it is fluid. And there

1352
01:05:08.544 --> 01:05:09.294
describing it is ﬂuid. And there
is,

1353
01:05:09.294 --> 01:05:11.127
describing it is fluid. And there
is, however, beyond doubt, going to

1354
01:05:11.127 --> 01:05:13.169
is, however, beyond doubt, going to
be a big announcement from the

1355
01:05:13.169 --> 01:05:14.252
be a big announcement from the
Government probably on Monday, that

1356

Government probably on Monday, that
could come in on Wednesday, of a
