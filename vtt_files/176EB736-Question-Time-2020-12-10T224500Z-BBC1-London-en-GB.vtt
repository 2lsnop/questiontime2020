00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:20.610
Covid—19 remains highly contagious

2
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.651
and even people without
symptoms are spreading it.

3
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:26.110
So we need to keep washing our
hands...

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.068
SHE SINGS

5
00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:30.276
..wearing our face coverings...

6
00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:32.985
..and making space for each other.

7
00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.193
And now we’re indoors more...
Fixed it, Mum!

8
00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:38.568
..we should let fresh air in to help
blow Covid—19 particles away.

9
00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:41.735
Let’s keep doing all
we can to help stop the spread.

10
00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:45.235

countrrs economy is on its knees
and regardless

country’s economy is on its knees
and regardless of whether you are

64
00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:44.443
and regardless of whether you are
being a remainder or a Leaver, we

65
00:02:44.443 --> 00:02:46.860
being a remainder or a Leaver, we
are all suffering from a lack of

66
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.526
are all suffering from a lack of
closure due to the stubborn egos on

67
00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:52.610
closure due to the stubborn egos on
all sides. Where and how is it going

68
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.026
all sides. where and how is it going
to all

69
00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:55.610
all sides. Where and how is it going
to all end? Well, that is the

70
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.610
to all end? Well, that is the
$64,000 question, Robert? I

71
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.943
to all end? Well, that is the
$64,000 question, Robert? Iwant

72
00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:58.026
to all end? Well, that is the
$64,000 question, Robert? I want it

73
00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.401
$64,000 question, Robert? Iwant it
to end in a

74
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:00.610
$64,000 question, Robert? I want it
to end in a deal. I think we are now

75
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.818
to end in a deal. I think we are now
very much at the end game. It looks

76
00:03:02.818 --> 00:03:04.735
very much at the end game. It looks
like the end of the weekend when

77
00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:06.151
like the end of the weekend when
both things will be decided one way

78
00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:07.610
both things will be decided one way
or the other. We have been very

79
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.818
or the other. We have been very
dear

80
00:03:07.818 --> 00:03:09.568
or the other. We have been very
clear that we are not asking for the

81
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:12.485
clear that we are not asking for the
earth, we are not even asking for a

82
00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:15.151
earth, we are not even asking for a
bespoke deal. We want something akin

83
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:17.818
bespoke deal. We want something akin
to the relationship the EU enjoys

84
00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:20.276
to the relationship the EU enjoys
with Canada, very straightforward,

85
00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:22.068
with Canada, very straightforward,
free trade agreement which allows

86
00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:25.943
free trade agreement which allows
two sovereign state, in Britain, and

87
00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:28.193
two sovereign state, in Britain, and
a sovereign bloke to work together.

88
00:03:28.193 --> 00:03:28.526
a sovereign bloke to work together.
-- sovereign

89
00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:31.443
a sovereign bloke to work together.
—— sovereign block. I have a deal

90
00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:32.610
-- sovereign block. I have a deal
ran be done.

91
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.568
—— sovereign block. I have a deal
can be done. The Prime Minister is

92
00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:34.235
ran be done. The Prime Minister is
sounding very

93
00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:35.151
can be done. The Prime Minister is
sounding very pessimistic about it,

94
00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:37.485
sounding very pessimistic about it,
isn’t he? He is being very firm and

95
00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:39.651
isn’t he? He is being very firm and
direct about what we cannot accept.

96
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:43.068
direct about what we cannot accept.
The idea that somehow there can be a

97
00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:44.235
The idea that somehow there ran be a
continuing legal

98
00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:45.235
The idea that somehow there can be a
continuing legal link of the type

99
00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:48.693
continuing legal link of the type
that was in the end rejected, not

100
00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:53.443
that was in the end rejected, not
just in a referendum but in a

101
00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:54.860
just in a referendum but in a
succession of referendums is only

102
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.610
succession of referendums is only
stating the truth. Throughout this

103
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.568
stating the truth. Throughout this
we have been extremely direct about

104
00:03:58.568 --> 00:04:00.693
we have been extremely direct about
it. We had said that is not

105
00:04:00.693 --> 00:04:03.068
it. We had said that is not
acceptable, we cannot have a future

106
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:03.193
acceptable, we rannot have a future
relationship

107
00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:04.943
acceptable, we cannot have a future
relationship that means if we do

108
00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:09.443
relationship that means if we do
something as a sovereign state, then

109
00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:09.735
something as a sovereign state, then
Europe ran

110
00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:12.110
something as a sovereign state, then
Europe can impose tariffss or other

111
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.818
Europe ran impose tariffss or other
penalties

112
00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:14.443
Europe can impose tariffss or other
penalties upon us. That doesn’t seem

113
00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:16.985
penalties upon us. That doesn’t seem
to me to be consistent with a future

114
00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:18.318
to me to be consistent with a future
free trade agreement would like the

115
00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:22.443
free trade agreement would like the
ones we see across the world. What

116
00:04:22.443 --> 00:04:22.776
ones we see across the world. what
about this

117
00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:24.651
ones we see across the world. What
about this contingency deal, if you

118
00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:27.151
about this contingency deal, if you
like, that the EU suggested today?

119
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:29.110
like, that the EU suggested today?
That if we don’t manage to strike a

120
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.818
That if we don’t manage to strike a
deal and the Prime Minister is

121
00:04:30.818 --> 00:04:33.068
deal and the Prime Minister is
sounding very pessimistic this

122
00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:34.735
sounding very pessimistic this
evening, there will be contingency

123
00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:36.568
evening, there will be contingency
plan so planes can keep flying and

124
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:36.985
plan so planes ran keep ﬂying and
freight ran

125
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:37.943
plan so planes can keep flying and
freight can keep going between the

126
00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:38.276
freight ran keep going between the
countries,

127
00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:39.068
freight can keep going between the
countries, is the Government likely

128
00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:41.485
countries, is the Government likely
to accept that deal? We have been

129
00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:42.860
to accept that deal? We have been
preparing throughout for a change

130
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.526
preparing throughout for a change
that would come in any event at the

131
00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:46.943
that would come in any event at the
end of the year, with or without a

132
00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:48.985
end of the year, with or without a
deal, there would be changes. Is it

133
00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:51.026
deal, there would be changes. Is it
likely to accept what the EU is

134
00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:54.151
likely to accept what the EU is
offering, the easing of movement

135
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:55.985
offering, the easing of movement
between the EU and the UK while

136
00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:59.235
between the EU and the UK while
Ideal tries to get thrashed out? We

137
00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.735
Ideal tries to get thrashed out? We
will do everything to advance the

138
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:03.193
will do everything to advance the
interests of the citizens that we

139
00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:07.235
interests of the citizens that we
serve. Clearly, it is an everybody’s

140
00:05:07.235 --> 00:05:07.443
serve. Clearty, it is an everybode
interests

141
00:05:07.443 --> 00:05:08.485
serve. Clearly, it is an everybody’s
interests to avoid the logistical

142
00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:11.485
interests to avoid the logistical
difficulties... Is that a yes or no?

143
00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:12.860
difficulties... Is that a yes or no?
I’m concentrating on the current

144
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.735
I’m concentrating on the current
negotiation. I think it is right for

145
00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:16.985
negotiation. I think it is right for
us to do that and really push it to

146
00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:19.526
us to do that and really push it to
the end. The Prime Minister is

147
00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:21.860
the end. The Prime Minister is
straining every sinew to get this

148
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.651
straining every sinew to get this
sorted out. That has been our

149
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:25.526
sorted out. That has been our
position throughout. It’s very

150
00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:26.443
position throughout. It’s very
dear, very

151
00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:27.360
position throughout. It’s very
clear, very straightforward. I hope

152
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.651
dear, very straightforward. I hope
that my

153
00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:28.485
clear, very straightforward. I hope
that my friends in Europe are

154
00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:30.568
that my friends in Europe are
listening and they will act in a way

155
00:05:30.568 --> 00:05:33.693
listening and they will act in a way
that means we can reach that

156
00:05:33.693 --> 00:05:33.860
that means we ran reach that
agreement.

157
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.485
that means we can reach that
agreement. Also listening is Malcolm

158
00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.943
agreement. Also listening is Malcolm
Turnbull, a former Prime Minister of

159
00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:39.110
Turnbull, a former Prime Minister of
Australia. The Prime Minister here

160
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.776
Australia. The Prime Minister here
has said tonight get ready for an

161
00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:42.943
has said tonight get ready for an
Australia style deal if we don’t

162
00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.568
Australia style deal if we don’t
manage to sort out a trade deal with

163
00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:48.193
manage to sort out a trade deal with
the EU. Should the UK be happy with

164
00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:52.276
the EU. Should the UK be happy with
that, in your opinion? Well, it will

165
00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:54.901
that, in your opinion? Well, it will
be pretty disappointing, I think. We

166
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:59.151
be pretty disappointing, I think. We
have a deal with the EU on WTO terms

167
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.735
have a deal with the EU on WTO terms
and there are really some very large

168
00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:02.818
and there are really some very large
barriers to Australian trade with

169
00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:06.651
barriers to Australian trade with
Europe, which we are seeking to

170
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.026
Europe, which we are seeking to
address as we negotiate a free—trade

171
00:06:09.026 --> 00:06:09.276
address as we negotiate a free-trade
agreement

172
00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:10.485
address as we negotiate a free—trade
agreement with Europe. But

173
00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:12.568
agreement with Europe. But
Australians would not regard our

174
00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:15.026
Australians would not regard our
trade relationship with Europe as

175
00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:16.860
trade relationship with Europe as
being a satisfactory one. I mean,

176
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.651
being a satisfactory one. I mean,
they are rather third biggest

177
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:21.860
they are rather third biggest
trading partner I guess because it

178
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.693
trading partner I guess because it
is such a big economy but there are

179
00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:28.235
is such a big economy but there are
very big barriers to Australian

180
00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:29.235
very big barriers to Australian
exports, of agricultural products in

181
00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:32.026
exports, of agricultural products in
particular. There are a lot of

182
00:06:32.026 --> 00:06:34.693
particular. There are a lot of
frictions in the system, in terms of

183
00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:37.443
frictions in the system, in terms of
services. There is a lot to aim for.

184
00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:38.151
services. There is a lot to aim for.
when I was

185
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:38.568
services. There is a lot to aim for.
When I was Prime Minister, we

186
00:06:38.568 --> 00:06:41.193
when I was Prime Minister, we
started

187
00:06:41.193 --> 00:06:42.568
When I was Prime Minister, we
started formal negotiations over

188
00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:42.776
started formal negotiations over
European-

189
00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:43.443
started formal negotiations over
European— Australian free trade

190
00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:43.776
European- Australian free trade
agreement

191
00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:45.235
European— Australian free trade
agreement but that will take some

192
00:06:45.235 --> 00:06:49.943
agreement but that will take some
time. Be careful what you wish for.

193
00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:52.318
time. Be careful what you wish for.
Australia’s relationship with the EU

194
00:06:52.318 --> 00:06:54.901
Australia’s relationship with the EU
is not one, from a trade point of

195
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.735
is not one, from a trade point of
view, that Britain, I think,

196
00:06:56.735 --> 00:06:56.985
is not one, from a trade point of
view, that Britain, Ithink, would

197
00:06:56.985 --> 00:07:02.360
view, that Britain, Ithink, would
want. Frankly. Julia? With all due

198
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.735
want. Frankly. julia? with all due
respect, Mr

199
00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:05.568
want. Frankly. Julia? With all due
respect, Mr Turnbull referred to

200
00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:07.443
respect, Mr Turnbull referred to
Brexit as a catastrophe after he

201
00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:08.985
Brexit as a catastrophe after he
left office, that’s not what I think

202
00:07:08.985 --> 00:07:11.235
left office, that’s not what I think
it is. Where we end up with a Deal

203
00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:12.026
it is. where we end up with a Deal
or no Deal?

204
00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:13.068
it is. Where we end up with a Deal
or no Deal? I genuinely think anyone

205
00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:16.193
or no Deal? I genuinely think anyone
who thinks they know right now,

206
00:07:16.193 --> 00:07:17.776
who thinks they know right now,
including Michel Barnier and Lauder

207
00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:18.276
including Michel Barnier and lauder
Frost, the

208
00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:19.318
including Michel Barnier and Lauder
Frost, the two negotiators, I think

209
00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:22.401
Frost, the two negotiators, I think
they would be lying, we don’t know.

210
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:24.818
they would be lying, we don’t know.
If this is the last... Waiting for

211
00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:26.860
If this is the last... Waiting for
the other side to blink moment or

212
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.110
the other side to blink moment or
the inevitable drama you would get

213
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.026
the inevitable drama you would get
at the end of any sort of trade deal

214
00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:32.193
at the end of any sort of trade deal
going right at the 11th hour, the

215
00:07:32.193 --> 00:07:33.901
going right at the 11th hour, the
last second of the 11th hour, who

216
00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:35.526
last second of the 11th hour, who
knows? I think the crucial thing to

217
00:07:35.526 --> 00:07:37.693
knows? I think the crucial thing to
remember here is why people voted

218
00:07:37.693 --> 00:07:40.026
remember here is why people voted
Brexit. I’m pretty sure, as is

219
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.776
Brexit. I’m pretty sure, as is
always the case when I’m on the

220
00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:42.276
always the rase when I’m on the
show, I

221
00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:42.443
always the rase when I’m on the
show, lam

222
00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:43.985
always the case when I’m on the
show, I am the only person here who

223
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:46.026
show, I am the only person here who
voted for Brexit. I voted for Brexit

224
00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:47.860
voted for Brexit. I voted for Brexit
not because, I wonder what the

225
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.526
not because, I wonder what the
tariff will be on oranges or milk or

226
00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:53.110
tariff will be on oranges or milk or
W tars coming

227
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.943
tariff will be on oranges or milk or
VW cars coming into the country? I

228
00:07:53.943 --> 00:07:54.318
WI tars coming into the country? I
voted for

229
00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:55.235
VW cars coming into the country? I
voted for Brexit because I want the

230
00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:57.026
voted for Brexit because I want the
people in charge of my country to be

231
00:07:57.026 --> 00:07:57.235
peoplc in charge of my country to be
democratically

232
00:07:57.235 --> 00:07:58.568
people in charge of my country to be
democratically accountable to me and

233
00:07:58.568 --> 00:07:59.651
democratically accountable to me and
everybody else here. Because I

234
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:02.776
everybody else here. Because I
believe we are proud nation an

235
00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:03.901
believe we are proud nation an
independent state and I don’t want

236
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:05.776
independent state and I don’t want
others to have a say over how we run

237
00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:05.985
others to have a say over how we mn

principle, which is why most peopla
voted for

difficulties ahead of getting a

Brexit deal, given what the EU are
offering, become very clear and very

00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.068
offering, become very clear and very
difficult to surmount. If the EU is

00:08:18.068 --> 00:08:19.651
difficult to surmount. If the EU is
basically saying they want to play a

basically saying they want to play a

says whatever we do, you have to

250
00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:25.110
says whatever we do, you have to
follow, here are the rules we have

251
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.443
follow, here are the mles we have
and the

252
00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:26.485
follow, here are the rules we have
and the regulations we have and if

253
00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:28.110
and the regulations we have and if
we change them in the future, you

254
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.901
we change them in the future, you
have to change them we will punish

255
00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:32.610
have to change them we will punish
you. Now, there is no nation state

256
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.443
you. Now, there is no nation state
that would put up with that. Whether

257
00:08:34.443 --> 00:08:35.901
that would put up with that. whether
they were a

258
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:36.526
that would put up with that. Whether
they were a tiny little Caribbean

259
00:08:36.526 --> 00:08:38.943
they were a tiny little Caribbean
nation in the middle of the Pacific,

260
00:08:38.943 --> 00:08:40.401
nation in the middle of the Pacific,
America, China or Britain, France

261
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:42.276
America, China or Britain, France
wouldn’t put up with being told that

262
00:08:42.276 --> 00:08:44.651
wouldn’t put up with being told that
by the EU if they were outside the

263
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:46.568
by the EU if they were outside the
EU, so it is impossible for the

264
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.818
EU, so it is impossible for the
Prime Minister to give on that. It’s

265
00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:50.443
Prime Minister to give on that. It’s
impossible for the Prime Minister to

266
00:08:50.443 --> 00:08:51.985
impossible for the Prime Minister to
agree the European Court of

267
00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:52.110
impossible for the Prime Minister to
agree the European Court ofJustice

268
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.526
agree the European Court of justice
should

269
00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:56.360
agree the European Court ofJustice
should have the final say on issues

270
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.151
should have the final say on issues
dispute. It’s impossible for us to

271
00:08:59.151 --> 00:08:59.360
dispute. It’s impossible for us to
55V

272
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.776
dispute. It’s impossible for us to
say yes, of course we don’t have any

273
00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:02.818
say yes, of course we don’t have any
rights over our own fishing. These

274
00:09:02.818 --> 00:09:03.901
rights over our own fishing. These
are fundamental principles and if

275
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:04.985
are fundamental principlas and if
the EU

276
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:06.818
are fundamental principles and if
the EU is demanding we give up on

277
00:09:06.818 --> 00:09:07.610
the EU is demanding we give up on
those fundamental principles, I’m

278
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.818
those fundamental principlas, I’m
afraid

279
00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:09.568
those fundamental principles, I’m
afraid Adeel will not be done. If

280
00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:12.151
afraid Adeel will not be done. If
there is a cost to that, so be it.

281
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.985
there is a cost to that, so be it.
Not my ideal but if that is the case

282
00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:14.401
Not my ideal but if that is the use
I would

283
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:16.026
Not my ideal but if that is the case
I would rather stick with the

284
00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:16.235
I would rather stick with the
principlas

285
00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:17.193
I would rather stick with the
principles that we are an

286
00:09:17.193 --> 00:09:18.276
principles that we are an
independent nation state and we

287
00:09:18.276 --> 00:09:19.651
independent nation state and we
should be treated like that and not

288
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:21.818
should be treated like that and not
as a naughty school child that needs

289
00:09:21.818 --> 00:09:23.485
as a naughty school child that needs
to be punished. You say that you are

290
00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:25.526
to be punished. You say that you are
the only person who voted here. I

291
00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:27.443
the only person who voted here. I
will remind you we had the

292
00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:33.276
will remind you we had the
Government here who

293
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.276
Government here who campaigned to
take us out of Brexit and the EU so

294
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.443
take us out of Brexit and the EU so
you are not entirely alone. I’m

295
00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:39.860
you are not entirely alone. I’m
pretty sure. You have your hand up,

296
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.318
pretty sure. You have your hand up,
Stephen? why

297
00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:41.443
pretty sure. You have your hand up,
Stephen? Why can the Government not

298
00:09:41.443 --> 00:09:41.735
Stephen? why ran the Government not
explained to

299
00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:44.401
Stephen? Why can the Government not
explained to the people of great

300
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.110
explained to the people of great
Britain what being out of Europe

301
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.943
Britain what being out of Europe
actually means? And what is the real

302
00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:51.735
actually means? And what is the real
impact of no Deal? Surely, no Deal

303
00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:55.110
impact of no Deal? Surely, no Deal
might be better than a raw deal

304
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.776
might be better than a raw deal
based on what Europe thinks. Do you

305
00:09:59.776 --> 00:10:01.901
based on what Europe thinks. Do you
want us to talk the implications of

306
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:05.235
want us to talk the implications of
no Deal versus a thin deal, perhaps?

307
00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:07.485
no Deal versus a thin deal, perhaps?
The first thing I will say, I have a

308
00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:09.193
The first thing I will say, I have a
degree of respect for what

309
00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:09.401
The first thing I will say, I have a
degree of respect for whatJulia

310
00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:09.526
degree of respect for whatjulia
said.

311
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.193
degree of respect for whatJulia
said. There is a political

312
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:12.818
said. There is a political
principle. If there is an economic

313
00:10:12.818 --> 00:10:15.276
principle. If there is an economic
price to be paid, I will pay it,

314
00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:16.485
price to be paid, I will pay it,
that’s fine. What frustrates me

315
00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:16.651
that’s fine. what frustrates me
around

316
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:18.026
that’s fine. What frustrates me
around the debate around Brexit as

317
00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:19.526
around the debate around Brexit as
many people who say we can leave

318
00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:20.068
many people who say we ran leave
with no

319
00:10:20.068 --> 00:10:21.568
many people who say we can leave
with no Deal and it won’t have

320
00:10:21.568 --> 00:10:22.651
with no Deal and it won’t have
consequences, that is simply not

321
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:24.985
consequences, that is simply not
tme. It

322
00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:26.235
consequences, that is simply not
true. It has enormous consequences.

323
00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:27.735
tme. It has enormous consequences.
Even leaving with

324
00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:28.401
true. It has enormous consequences.
Even leaving with a deal has

325
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.443
Even leaving with a deal has
consequences because it affects our

326
00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:32.151
consequences because it affects our
trade. Without a deal means

327
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:32.235
trade. without a deal means
everything

328
00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:34.276
trade. Without a deal means
everything from cheques and tariffs,

329
00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:36.110
everything from cheques and tariffs,
which means price rises for

330
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.401
which means price rises for
foodstuffs coming from the

331
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:39.026
foodstuffs coming from the
continent, it will mean bigger

332
00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:40.860
continent, it will mean bigger
tailbacks. It will have a very

333
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.318
tailbacks. It will have a very
profound impact on how our economy

334
00:10:43.318 --> 00:10:44.985
profound impact on how our economy
works, how easy it is to trade with

335
00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:46.651
works, how easy it is to trade with
the European Union fostered going

336
00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:47.318
the European Union fostered going
back to julia,

337
00:10:47.318 --> 00:10:47.568
the European Union fostered going
back toJulia, if

338
00:10:47.568 --> 00:10:48.193
the European Union fostered going
back to Julie, if you say ultimately

339
00:10:48.193 --> 00:10:48.818
back to julia, if you say ultimately
I want to

340
00:10:48.818 --> 00:10:49.610
back to Julie, if you say ultimately
I want to be sovereign and I

341
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.860
back toJulia, if you say ultimately
I want to be sovereign and I mean

342
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.693
I want to be sovereign and I mean
they can’t tell me what to do and I

343
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.818
they can’t tell me what to do and I
will pay the price, that is

344
00:10:53.818 --> 00:10:55.026
will pay the price, that is
absolutely fine. But one other thing

345
00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:56.901
absolutely fine. But one other thing
is that were striking to me is when

346
00:10:56.901 --> 00:10:58.318
is that were striking to me is when
the Chancellor made his statement

347
00:10:58.318 --> 00:11:00.151
the Chancellor made his statement
recently was that even though the

348
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:02.401
recently was that even though the
OBR documents he drew on talked

349
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.901
OBR documents he drew on talked
about a A% impact on the economy of

350
00:11:04.901 --> 00:11:05.318
about a 496 impact on the economy of
Brexit

351
00:11:05.318 --> 00:11:06.985
about a A% impact on the economy of
Brexit with no Deal and 2% more if

352
00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:07.901
Brexit with no Deal and 296 more if
we have

353
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.151
Brexit with no Deal and 2% more if
we have no Deal chose not to mention

354
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:10.776
we have no Deal chose not to mention
Brexit at all. I would have thought

355
00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:12.235
Brexit at all. I would have thought
that if you are planning for

356
00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:13.776
that if you are planning for
something this big, and let’s face

357
00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:15.526
something this big, and let’s face
it, it has to be big or it wouldn’t

358
00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:17.151
it, it has to be big or it wouldn’t
have been worth the hassle. If you

359
00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:19.068
have been worth the hassle. If you
are planning to something this big,

360
00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:20.735
are planning to something this big,
the Government would say, these are

361
00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:22.068
the Government would say, these are
the impacts, this is what will

362
00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:23.651
the impacts, this is what will
happen, this is how we will prepare

363
00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:25.568
happen, this is how we will prepare
and ultimately it will be worth it

364
00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:26.818
and ultimately it will be worth it
but there is no planning or

365
00:11:26.818 --> 00:11:28.568
but there is no planning or
preparation and that I find

366
00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:34.610
preparation and that I find
mystifying. Let’s hear a bit more

367
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.776
mystifying. Let’s hear a bit more
from our audience. Susan?

368
00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:37.985
mystifying. Let’s hear a bit more
from ouraudience. Susan? I

369
00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:38.151
mystifying. Let’s hear a bit more
from our audience. Susan? I get

370
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:40.151
from our audience. Susan? I get
confused by the deal or no deal.

371
00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:41.610
confused by the deal or no deal.
From the moment we left or decided

372
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.985
From the moment we left or decided
to leave, the deal on the table was

373
00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:47.318
to leave, the deal on the table was
the WTO terms in the absence of

374
00:11:47.318 --> 00:11:49.151
the WTO terms in the absence of
anything else. So that is the deal

375
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:53.193
anything else. So that is the deal
and I think we never lost our

376
00:11:53.193 --> 00:11:56.401
and I think we never lost our
sovereignty by being in the EU and

377
00:11:56.401 --> 00:11:59.693
sovereignty by being in the EU and
we were much stronger at the table,

378
00:11:59.693 --> 00:12:02.151
we were much stronger at the table,
formulating the single market and

379
00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:02.776
formulating the singla market and
working with

380
00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:04.985
formulating the single market and
working with it, which seems to have

381
00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:06.360
working with it, which seems to have
had tremendous advantages the small,

382
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.026
had tremendous advantages the small,
medium and the big corporates in our

383
00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:11.943
medium and the big corporates in our
country. So

384
00:12:11.943 --> 00:12:12.193
medium and the big corporates in our
country. Sol

385
00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:14.235
medium and the big corporates in our
country. So Ijust about old enough

386
00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:15.901
country. So Ijust about old enough
remember going into the EU and now

387
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:19.276
remember going into the EU and now
we have come out and I only saw,

388
00:12:19.276 --> 00:12:20.776
we have come out and I only saw,
growing up, I only ever saw

389
00:12:20.776 --> 00:12:22.360
growing up, I only ever saw
advantages in my life to being in

390
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.901
advantages in my life to being in
the EU. Tony? Thank you. It’s really

391
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:30.235
the EU. Tony? Thank you. It’s really
nice to hear julia’s

392
00:12:30.235 --> 00:12:30.443
the EU. Tony? Thank you. It’s really
nice to hearJulia’s comments,

393
00:12:30.443 --> 00:12:32.276
nice to hear julia’s comments,
actually. For

394
00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:33.360
nice to hearJulia’s comments,
actually. For me, it’s a question of

395
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.485
actually. For me, it’s a question of
sovereignty. I will freely admit I

396
00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:36.985
sovereignty. I will freely admit I
voted to leave, not because of what

397
00:12:36.985 --> 00:12:39.610
voted to leave, not because of what
was said on the side of a bus or

398
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.818
was said on the side of a bus or
promises that were made by British

399
00:12:41.818 --> 00:12:43.651
promises that were made by British
politicians but absolutely it is a

400
00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:44.943
politicians but absolutely it is a
question of sovereignty. If that is

401
00:12:44.943 --> 00:12:46.401
question of sovereignty. If that is
lost through any deal that is made

402
00:12:46.401 --> 00:12:48.568
lost through any deal that is made
in the next few days, I think that

403
00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:55.026
in the next few days, I think that
will be a sad move. Vince? I was a

404
00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.735
will be a sad move. Vince? I was a
Remainer but I changed my mind when

405
00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.651
Remainer but I changed my mind when
I saw the level of bullying from

406
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:01.693
I saw the level of bullying from
Brussels and that we do seem to be

407
00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:02.068
Bmssels and that we do seem to be
very much

408
00:13:02.068 --> 00:13:03.443
Brussels and that we do seem to be
very much dominated. I would like to

409
00:13:03.443 --> 00:13:06.860
very much dominated. I would like to
ask everybody, really, whether they

410
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.443
ask everybody, really, whether they
are of the opinion that the EU wants

411
00:13:09.443 --> 00:13:12.235
are of the opinion that the EU wants
it to her Britain and they actually

412
00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:13.235
it to her Britain and they actually
want to demonstrate that other

413
00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:14.776
want to demonstrate that other
countries shouldn’t begin to think

414
00:13:14.776 --> 00:13:16.526
countries shouldn’t begin to think
about this because it will really,

415
00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:22.985
about this because it will really,
really hurt? David? Yes, a question

416
00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:24.610
really hurt? David? Yes, a question
for Malcolm in Australia. It was

417
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.026
for Malcolm in Australia. It was
interesting to hear that he was

418
00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:28.193
interesting to hear that he was
talking down the deal the

419
00:13:28.193 --> 00:13:29.735
talking down the deal the
Australians have. We have always

420
00:13:29.735 --> 00:13:32.818
Australians have. We have always
been told that we can always fall

421
00:13:32.818 --> 00:13:33.776
been told that we ran always fall
back on

422
00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:34.443
been told that we can always fall
back on an Australian stroke

423
00:13:34.443 --> 00:13:36.860
back on an Australian stroke
Canadian deal as though it is some

424
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.151
Canadian deal as though it is some
form of second class. I am surprised

425
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.193
form of second class. I am surprised
Malcolm says it is a second—class

426
00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:41.568
Malcolm says it is a second-class
deal. I

427
00:13:41.568 --> 00:13:43.943
Malcolm says it is a second—class
deal. I was expecting him to beef it

428
00:13:43.943 --> 00:13:46.151
deal. I was expecting him to beef it
up. You were Prime Minister, Sir,

429
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:47.610
up. You were Prime Minister, Sir,
are you telling me you couldn’t get

430
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.360
are you telling me you couldn’t get
a deal with the EU? I will come to

431
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.818
a deal with the EU? I will come to
you in a minute Wes Streeting, but

432
00:13:51.818 --> 00:13:56.068
you in a minute Wes Streeting, but
Malcolm? Sure, the reality is the

433
00:13:56.068 --> 00:14:00.026
Malcolm? Sure, the reality is the
European Union has got along history

434
00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:01.485
European Union has got along history
of protectionism. You would

435
00:14:01.485 --> 00:14:02.776
of protectionism. You would
understand that. The trade deals are

436
00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:06.943
understand that. The trade deals are
very hard to negotiate. You know,

437
00:14:06.943 --> 00:14:10.110
very hard to negotiate. You know,
Britain, the minute Britain pulled

438
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.485
Britain, the minute Britain pulled
out, the minute the Brexit vote

439
00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:13.985
out, the minute the Brexit vote
occurred I said publicly, we will do

440
00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:16.901
occurred I said publicly, we will do
a free trade deal with the UK.

441
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:18.651
a free trade deal with the UK.
Negotiations are still continuing, I

442
00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:20.026
Negotiations are still continuing, I
hope they will be satisfactorily

443
00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:24.235
hope they will be satisfactorily
resolved but there are plenty of

444
00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:27.276
resolved but there are plenty of
points and issues, the protection of

445
00:14:27.276 --> 00:14:27.943
points and issues, the protection of
British agriculture from Australian

446
00:14:27.943 --> 00:14:30.318
British agriculture from Australian
imports being a very large issue.

447
00:14:30.318 --> 00:14:33.401
imports being a very large issue.
But I am hopeful that we will be

448
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:35.818
But I am hopeful that we will be
able to get a deal done. Look,

449
00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:38.526
able to get a deal done. Look,
believe me, we do not have a trade

450
00:14:38.526 --> 00:14:43.026
believe me, we do not have a trade
deal with the European Union per se.

451
00:14:43.026 --> 00:14:46.401
deal with the European Union per se.
We trade on World Trade Organization

452
00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:49.151
We trade on World Trade Organization
terms and we are seeking to achieve

453
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:51.443
terms and we are seeking to achieve
a free trade agreement. Look, just

454
00:14:51.443 --> 00:14:52.235
a free trade agreement. Look, just
with respect to what

455
00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:53.276
a free trade agreement. Look, just
with respect to whatJulia said, it

456
00:14:53.276 --> 00:14:53.860
with respect to whatjulia said, it
is not for

457
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.776
with respect to whatJulia said, it
is not for me to litigate Brexit.

458
00:14:56.776 --> 00:14:59.401
is not for me to litigate Brexit.
You guys have got to make your own

459
00:14:59.401 --> 00:15:02.735
You guys have got to make your own
decisions. The issue, however, is

460
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:03.443
decisions. The issue, however, is
that there will. ..

461
00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:03.568
decisions. The issue, however, is
that there will... It

462
00:15:03.568 --> 00:15:04.526
decisions. The issue, however, is
that there will. .. It will come

463
00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:04.651
decisions. The issue, however, is
that there will... It will come with

464
00:15:04.651 --> 00:15:06.818
that there will... It will come with
an economic cost, at least in the

465
00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:08.818
an economic cost, at least in the
short and medium term. I think what

466
00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:10.985
short and medium term. I think what
julia said is that

467
00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:11.985
short and medium term. I think what
Julia said is that she voted for

468
00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:12.193
julia said is that she voted for
Brexit

469
00:15:12.193 --> 00:15:14.151
Julia said is that she voted for
Brexit and was prepared to pay that

470
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.943
Brexit and was prepared to pay that
cost. I think what was a pity, a

471
00:15:16.943 --> 00:15:19.693
cost. I think what was a pity, a
real pity, is when the referendum

472
00:15:19.693 --> 00:15:23.735
real pity, is when the referendum
was held, there wasn’t any clear or

473
00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:24.735
was held, there wasn’t any clear or
objective or authoritative

474
00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:25.943
objective or authoritative
understanding of what their economic

475
00:15:25.943 --> 00:15:30.401
understanding of what their economic
cost would be. So, in a sense, the

476
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:32.235
cost would be. So, in a sense, the
British people were being asked to

477
00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:34.651
British people were being asked to
give an informed consent. But, you

478
00:15:34.651 --> 00:15:36.860
give an informed consent. But, you
know, the reality is the die is

479
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.401
know, the reality is the die is
fast, so I’m

480
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:39.401
know, the reality is the die is
cast, so I’m afraid to say, however,

481
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:40.693
fast, so I’m afraid to say, however,
that we are living

482
00:15:40.693 --> 00:15:41.985
cast, so I’m afraid to say, however,
that we are living in a time of

483
00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:44.735
that we are living in a time of
rising protectionism. You know, the

484
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:50.443
rising protectionism. You know, the
global sentiment tends swing from

485
00:15:50.443 --> 00:15:51.818
global sentiment tends swing from
free trade to protectionism and it’s

486
00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:53.943
free trade to protectionism and it’s
been swinging back in the area of

487
00:15:53.943 --> 00:15:55.318
been swinging back in the area of
protectionism for a while. There is

488
00:15:55.318 --> 00:15:58.151
protectionism for a while. There is
one bit of good news I can give you,

489
00:15:58.151 --> 00:15:59.735
one bit of good news I ran give you,
though, which is

490
00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:02.235
one bit of good news I can give you,
though, which is when Donald Trump

491
00:16:02.235 --> 00:16:02.776
though, which is when Donald Tmmp
pulled out of

492
00:16:02.776 --> 00:16:03.443
though, which is when Donald Trump
pulled out of the transpacific

493
00:16:03.443 --> 00:16:04.943
pulled out of the transpacific
partnership, I managed to keep that

494
00:16:04.943 --> 00:16:06.360
partnership, I managed to keep that
deal alive without America, which

495
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.860
deal alive without America, which
was quite an unlikely prospect but

496
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:16.985
was quite an unlikely prospect but
we got it done. That trade deal

497
00:16:16.985 --> 00:16:21.485
we got it done. That trade deal
therefore is alive and in force and

498
00:16:21.485 --> 00:16:22.943
therefore is alive and in force and
I hope the United Kingdom will

499
00:16:22.943 --> 00:16:23.151
therefore is alive and in force and
I hope the United Kingdom willjoin

500
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:23.610
I hope the United Kingdom will join
that and

501
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.443
I hope the United Kingdom willjoin
that and I have no doubt that the

502
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:26.735
that and I have no doubt that the
Australian government will support

503
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:29.443
Australian government will support
that. So, you know, if you do end up

504
00:16:29.443 --> 00:16:34.068
that. So, you know, if you do end up
joining the TPP, your Aussie mates

505
00:16:34.068 --> 00:16:36.568
joining the TPP, your Aussie mates
will have given you a very good hand

506
00:16:36.568 --> 00:16:38.443
will have given you a very good hand
in keeping that deal alive, so that

507
00:16:38.443 --> 00:16:39.026
in keeping that deal alive, so that
it ran be

508
00:16:39.026 --> 00:16:41.776
in keeping that deal alive, so that
it can bejoined. And indeed I hope

509
00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:42.026
it ran be joined. And indeed I hope
that

510
00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:44.943
it can bejoined. And indeed I hope
that America rejoins it. But Biden

511
00:16:44.943 --> 00:16:46.235
that America rejoins it. But Biden
has a different approach to trade

512
00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:49.235
has a different approach to trade
historically than Trump but

513
00:16:49.235 --> 00:16:51.526
historically than Trump but
protectionism per se has really

514
00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:52.985
protectionism per se has really
risen as a political sentiment in

515
00:16:52.985 --> 00:16:54.818
risen as a political sentiment in
the United States and around the

516
00:16:54.818 --> 00:16:57.818
the United States and around the
world. You know, it’s not... This is

517
00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:59.443
world. You know, it’s not... This is
a... You’ve

518
00:16:59.443 --> 00:17:00.360
world. You know, it’s not... This is
3... You’ve chosen a very courageous

519
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.026
a... You’ve chosen a very courageous
time to leave

520
00:17:01.026 --> 00:17:01.651
3... You’ve chosen a very courageous
time to leave the largest free

521
00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:01.860
a... You’ve chosen a very courageous
time to leave the largest free trade

522
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.776
time to leave the largest free trade
zone in the world.

523
00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:14.443
Sounds like listening to Malcolm we
picked the wrong form Australian

524
00:17:14.443 --> 00:17:15.526
picked the wrong form Australian
Prime Minister to advise the Board

525
00:17:15.526 --> 00:17:17.235
Prime Minister to advise the Board
of trade but seriously, we are

526
00:17:17.235 --> 00:17:18.401
of trade but seriously, we are
potentially days away from or no

527
00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:19.776
potentially days away from or no
deal scenario that I don’t think any

528
00:17:19.776 --> 00:17:22.276
deal scenario that I don’t think any
of us want to see. If anyone on the

529
00:17:22.276 --> 00:17:24.401
of us want to see. If anyone on the
EU side of the talks, by the way,

530
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:25.485
EU side of the talks, by the way,
thinks that this would be

531
00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:27.110
thinks that this would be
consequence free for our friends and

532
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.485
consequence free for our friends and
partners over the channel on the

533
00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:30.776
partners over the channel on the
European continent or our friends in

534
00:17:30.776 --> 00:17:33.151
European continent or our friends in
the Republic of Ireland, they are

535
00:17:33.151 --> 00:17:34.735
the Republic of Ireland, they are
sorely mistaken. There’s a lot

536
00:17:34.735 --> 00:17:36.485
sorely mistaken. There’s a lot
riding on this on both sides of the

537
00:17:36.485 --> 00:17:37.943
riding on this on both sides of the
negotiations, lots of people’s jobs

538
00:17:37.943 --> 00:17:41.818
negotiations, lots of people’s jobs
and livelihoods, the collective

539
00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:43.193
and livelihoods, the collactive
security of

540
00:17:43.193 --> 00:17:44.068
and livelihoods, the collective
security of our country and our

541
00:17:44.068 --> 00:17:45.568
security of our country and our
friends across the European Union. I

542
00:17:45.568 --> 00:17:47.360
friends across the European Union. I
want to see the government get a

543
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.276
want to see the government get a
deal and I desperately hope, by the

544
00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:49.651
deal and I desperately hope, by the
way, that

545
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:51.443
deal and I desperately hope, by the
way, thatJuliet is right and some

546
00:17:51.443 --> 00:17:52.193
way, that juliet is right and some
of this is

547
00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:52.943
way, thatJuliet is right and some
of this is choreography. I fear,

548
00:17:52.943 --> 00:17:55.110
of this is choreography. I fear,
listening to what the Prime Minister

549
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.526
listening to what the Prime Minister
has said and what Ursula von der

550
00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:58.068
has said and what Ursula von der
Leyen from the European Union side

551
00:17:58.068 --> 00:17:59.735
Leyen from the European Union side
says, that is not where we are and

552
00:17:59.735 --> 00:18:01.651
says, that is not where we are and
that should really worry us. I will

553
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:02.401
that should really worry us. I will
give practical examples because

554
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:04.610
give practical examples because
people don’t like forecasts and

555
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.026
people don’t like forecasts and
predictions but practical example of

556
00:18:06.026 --> 00:18:07.485
predictions but practical example of
what that would mean. The chairman

557
00:18:07.485 --> 00:18:08.610
what that would mean. The chairman
of Tesco is currently warning us

558
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.818
of Tesco is currently warning us
that prices will go up by 5%. I

559
00:18:11.818 --> 00:18:12.443
that prices will go up by 596. I
think he

560
00:18:12.443 --> 00:18:13.276
that prices will go up by 5%. I
think he understands his business,

561
00:18:13.276 --> 00:18:15.318
think he understands his business,
the Prime Minister’s spokesman says

562
00:18:15.318 --> 00:18:17.276
the Prime Minister’s spokesman says
he is right, they are telling their

563
00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:18.443
he is right, they are telling their
customers, myself included, bills

564
00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:21.735
customers, myself included, bills
are going to go up. What about the

565
00:18:21.735 --> 00:18:23.860
are going to go up. What about the
unintended consequences? I am Shadow

566
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.693
unintended consequences? I am Shadow
schools minister. In recent weeks,

567
00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:26.651
schools minister. In recent weeks,
the Department for Education has

568
00:18:26.651 --> 00:18:28.026
the Department for Education has
written to every head teacher in the

569
00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:29.693
written to every head teacher in the
country and said you need to look at

570
00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:30.901
country and said you need to look at
your school food supply chains and

571
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.568
your school food supply chains and
make sure you have got long life

572
00:18:32.568 --> 00:18:34.818
make sure you have got long life
product in in case there is any

573
00:18:34.818 --> 00:18:35.651
product in in use there is any
dismption

574
00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:36.693
product in in case there is any
disruption from January the ist. I

575
00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:36.818
dismption from january the 1st. I
consider

576
00:18:36.818 --> 00:18:37.776
disruption from January the 1st. I
consider myself someone who has

577
00:18:37.776 --> 00:18:39.735
consider myself someone who has
followed the twists and turns of

578
00:18:39.735 --> 00:18:41.193
followed the twists and turns of
this quite closely. I would never in

579
00:18:41.193 --> 00:18:44.818
this quite closely. I would never in
a million years have thought no—deal

580
00:18:44.818 --> 00:18:44.943
a million years have thought no-deal
Brexit

581
00:18:44.943 --> 00:18:45.776
a million years have thought no—deal
Brexit would mean problems with

582
00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:45.985
Brexit would mean problams with
school

583
00:18:45.985 --> 00:18:47.360
Brexit would mean problems with
school food. Whether it is the

584
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.651
school food. whether it is the
things we

585
00:18:47.651 --> 00:18:49.443
school food. Whether it is the
things we have been warned about in

586
00:18:49.443 --> 00:18:50.901
things we have been warned about in
terms of manufacturing, just—in—time

587
00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:51.610
terms of manufacturing, just-in-time
sunplv

588
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.776
terms of manufacturing, just-in-time
supply chains

589
00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:52.985
terms of manufacturing, just—in—time
supply chains and disruption to jobs

590
00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:53.068
supply chains and dismption to jobs
and

591
00:18:53.068 --> 00:18:54.151
supply chains and disruption to jobs
and livelihoods and the debate we

592
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:55.443
and livelihoods and the debate we
have frankly been having for the

593
00:18:55.443 --> 00:18:58.526
have frankly been having for the
last four years, or the unintended

594
00:18:58.526 --> 00:19:00.610
last four years, or the unintended
consequences, the unpredictable.

595
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.276
consequences, the unpredictable.
There is so much riding on our

596
00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:03.901
There is so much riding on our
political leaders in the next few

597
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:05.651
political leaders in the next few
days to try to put the ideological

598
00:19:05.651 --> 00:19:07.985
days to try to put the ideological
disagreements to one side and focus

599
00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:10.443
disagreements to one side and focus
on the practical outcomes for the

600
00:19:10.443 --> 00:19:11.943
on the practical outcomes for the
British people and for people right

601
00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:12.193
British peopla and for peopla right
across

602
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.068
British people and for people right
across the continent because if no

603
00:19:14.068 --> 00:19:15.651
across the continent because if no
deal was a bad idea in the good

604
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:18.360
deal was a bad idea in the good
times, we are now in the midst,

605
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.860
times, we are now in the midst,
still, of a global pandemic which is

606
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.610
still, of a global pandemic which is
not just having

607
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.318
still, of a global pandemic which is
notjust having a huge impact on

608
00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:22.985
not just having a huge impact on
people’s

609
00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:24.610
notjust having a huge impact on
people’s lives but ravaging people’s

610
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.276
people’s lives but ravaging people’s
livelihoods so no deal is not a

611
00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:27.901
livelihoods so no deal is not a
future we can afford and that is why

612
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.276
future we ran afford and that is why
so much is riding

613
00:19:29.276 --> 00:19:29.943
future we can afford and that is why
so much is riding on the exudates.

614
00:19:29.943 --> 00:19:31.526
so much is riding on the exudates.
Robert, I want to come to you before

615
00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:32.985
Robert, I want to come to you before
we move onto another question in

616
00:19:32.985 --> 00:19:34.943
we move onto another question in
terms of what Malcolm has said. As I

617
00:19:34.943 --> 00:19:36.610
terms of what Malcolm has said. As I
said at the beginning of the

618
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.026
said at the beginning of the
programme, the Prime Minister has

619
00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:39.985
programme, the Prime Minister has
said in effect get ready for an

620
00:19:39.985 --> 00:19:41.401
said in effect get ready for an
Australia style deal, the chances of

621
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:43.443
Australia style deal, the chances of
a trade deal are not looking

622
00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:44.526
a trade deal are not looking
particularly good at the moment.

623
00:19:44.526 --> 00:19:46.443
particularly good at the moment.
Malcolm Turnbull, as you heard, is

624
00:19:46.443 --> 00:19:48.443
Malcolm Turnbull, as you heard, is
lukewarm at best about how good an

625
00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:50.026
lukewarm at best about how good an
option that would be. Does that not

626
00:19:50.026 --> 00:19:51.651
option that would be. Does that not
give you pause for thought? I

627
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.443
give you pause for thought? I
thought what Malcolm said about the

628
00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.735
thought what Malcolm said about the
rise of protectionism is very

629
00:19:55.735 --> 00:19:57.860
rise of protectionism is very
interesting and he did say that of

630
00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.068
interesting and he did say that of
course, the tendency within the

631
00:19:59.068 --> 00:20:01.068
course, the tendency within the
European bloc is indeed, sadly,

632
00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:03.151
European bloc is indeed, sadly,
whilst it has got a single market

633
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:03.360
whilst it has got a singla market
that

634
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.276
whilst it has got a single market
that works for its members, it tends

635
00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:07.693
that works for its members, it tends
to put up barriers against other

636
00:20:07.693 --> 00:20:09.568
to put up barriers against other
states and it is difficult to

637
00:20:09.568 --> 00:20:13.985
states and it is difficult to
negotiate free trade arrangements.

638
00:20:13.985 --> 00:20:14.401
negotiate free trade arrangements.
So how

639
00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:15.151
negotiate free trade arrangements.
50 how optimistic should we be

640
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:17.068
So how optimistic should we be
feeling if we have got the Prime

641
00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:19.026
feeling if we have got the Prime
Minister saying, let’s go for an

642
00:20:19.026 --> 00:20:20.235
Minister saying, let’s go for an
Australia style deal, it will be

643
00:20:20.235 --> 00:20:21.610
Australia style deal, it will be
fine and the form Australian prime

644
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.026
fine and the form Australian prime
ministers say it is not great. What

645
00:20:24.026 --> 00:20:24.401
ministers say it is not great. what
the Prime

646
00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:25.151
ministers say it is not great. What
the Prime Minister is adhering to

647
00:20:25.151 --> 00:20:27.026
the Prime Minister is adhering to
the principle of free trade. We know

648
00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:30.860
the principle of free trade. We know
that history teaches us that free

649
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.026
that history teaches us that free
trade, open markets is actually the

650
00:20:32.026 --> 00:20:34.110
trade, open markets is actually the
best way to raise living standards

651
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.568
best way to raise living standards
and to lift more people out of

652
00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:35.776
and to lift more peopla out of
poverty.

653
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:36.985
and to lift more people out of
poverty. That is what works and it

654
00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:38.235
poverty. That is what works and it
is I think important for this

655
00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:40.485
is I think important for this
country at this time to stand up and

656
00:20:40.485 --> 00:20:44.193
country at this time to stand up and
stand firm in favour of that open

657
00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:46.235
stand firm in favour of that open
approach, and all we are saying to

658
00:20:46.235 --> 00:20:46.485
approach, and all we are saying to
our

659
00:20:46.485 --> 00:20:47.610
approach, and all we are saying to
ourfriends in Europe is, look, we

660
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:48.068
our friends in Europe is, look, we
want to

661
00:20:48.068 --> 00:20:49.651
ourfriends in Europe is, look, we
want to work with you. We are in

662
00:20:49.651 --> 00:20:51.026
want to work with you. We are in
your neighbourhood, we are your

663
00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:53.485
your neighbourhood, we are your
friends, you know, we have been your

664
00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.901
friends, you know, we have been your
partners for generations. We just

665
00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:57.193
partners for generations. We just
want to change the terms of trade.

666
00:20:57.193 --> 00:20:58.943
want to change the terms of trade.
It is not so difficult to make that

667
00:20:58.943 --> 00:21:01.443
It is not so difficult to make that
task. I

668
00:21:01.443 --> 00:21:01.651
It is not so difficult to make that
task. Iappeal

669
00:21:01.651 --> 00:21:03.026
It is not so difficult to make that
task. I appeal to them, to our

670
00:21:03.026 --> 00:21:04.651
task. I appeal to them, to our
friends in Europe, to put aside

671
00:21:04.651 --> 00:21:09.026
friends in Europe, to put aside
ideology and think of the people who

672
00:21:09.026 --> 00:21:09.568
ideology and think of the people who
we all jointly

673
00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:10.443
ideology and think of the people who
we alljointly served, and then I

674
00:21:10.443 --> 00:21:10.985
we all jointly served, and then I
think we

675
00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:12.026
we alljointly served, and then I
think we can reach the agreement

676
00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:12.110
think we ran reach the agreement
that

677
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.485
think we can reach the agreement
that would be in our common

678
00:21:13.485 --> 00:21:15.026
that would be in our common
interests, as Wes says, there’s a

679
00:21:15.026 --> 00:21:17.110
interests, as Wes says, there’s a
lot riding on this and there huge

680
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.068
lot riding on this and there huge
disadvantages for our European

681
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.526
disadvantages for our European
friends if they don’t come to that

682
00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:23.485
friends if they don’t come to that
sensible deal. You are right to talk

683
00:21:23.485 --> 00:21:24.818
sensible deal. You are right to talk
about openness but the Prime

684
00:21:24.818 --> 00:21:26.360
about openness but the Prime
Minister has got to be open now the

685
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.235
Minister has got to be open now the
public. It is not an Australia deal,

686
00:21:29.235 --> 00:21:29.568
public. It is not an Australia deal,
did me

687
00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:31.235
public. It is not an Australia deal,
did WTO terms, let’s spell that out,

688
00:21:31.235 --> 00:21:32.568
did WTO terms, let’s spell that out,
the government is saying get ready

689
00:21:32.568 --> 00:21:34.651
the government is saying get ready
for Brexit to business but get ready

690
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:34.943
for Brexit to business but get ready
for what?

691
00:21:34.943 --> 00:21:35.235
for Brexit to business but get ready
forwhat? Is

692
00:21:35.235 --> 00:21:36.568
for Brexit to business but get ready
for what? Is it going to be a deal

693
00:21:36.568 --> 00:21:39.026
for what? Is it going to be a deal
or no deal? We are days away from

694
00:21:39.026 --> 00:21:40.943
or no deal? We are days away from
the 1st of January. Whose fault is

695
00:21:40.943 --> 00:21:41.401
the 1st of january. whose fault is
that? I’m

696
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.610
the 1st of January. Whose fault is
that? I’m not going to say it is

697
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:42.985
the lst of January. Whose fault is
that? I’m not going to say it is all

698
00:21:42.985 --> 00:21:44.901
that? I’m not going to say it is all
of the UK Government side, it takes

699
00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:46.985
of the UK Government side, it takes
two to tango but these issues are

700
00:21:46.985 --> 00:21:48.901
two to tango but these issues are
not new, right? This is not new and

701
00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:50.276
not new, right? This is not new and
the issues that are currently being

702
00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:52.443
the issues that are currently being
laid on the table as the barriers

703
00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:53.360
laid on the table as the barriers
are entirely predictable. They’ve

704
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:53.526
are entirely predictable. Therve
been

705
00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:54.860
are entirely predictable. They’ve
been the centre of the debate for

706
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.943
been the centre of the debate for
years and the Prime Minister

707
00:21:55.943 --> 00:21:58.151
years and the Prime Minister
promised an oven ready deal. It is

708
00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:58.943
promised an oven ready deal. It is
dearty not. The

709
00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.485
promised an oven ready deal. It is
clearly not. The other and ready

710
00:22:01.485 --> 00:22:01.901
dearty not. The other and ready
deal was

711
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:03.943
clearly not. The other and ready
deal was the withdrawn agreement.

712
00:22:03.943 --> 00:22:05.526
deal was the withdrawn agreement.
They have already said that. It was

713
00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:07.193
They have already said that. It was
in the manifesto it was the

714
00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:08.318
in the manifesto it was the
withdrawn agreement. We are

715
00:22:08.318 --> 00:22:09.401
withdrawn agreement. We are
preparing for all eventualities, it

716
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:10.776
preparing for all eventualities, it
is wrong to say we are somehow

717
00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:12.443
is wrong to say we are somehow
sitting back and not doing anything

718
00:22:12.443 --> 00:22:15.276
sitting back and not doing anything
for we have invested £750 billion

719
00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:16.610
for we have invested £750 billion
into border technology, we have been

720
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.360
into border technology, we have been
preparing for this by making sure

721
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:18.526
preparing for this by making sure
sunplv

722
00:22:18.526 --> 00:22:20.360
preparing for this by making sure
supply chains are resilient in all

723
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.818
supply chains are resilient in all
our public services. This is the

724
00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:23.235
our public services. This is the
work of a government that has been

725
00:22:23.235 --> 00:22:23.818
work of a government that has been
going on not

726
00:22:23.818 --> 00:22:25.151
work of a government that has been
going on notjust for the last few

727
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:25.443
going on not just for the last few
months

728
00:22:25.443 --> 00:22:26.776
going on notjust for the last few
months but for the last 18 months

729
00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:27.151
months but for the last 18 months
since Boris

730
00:22:27.151 --> 00:22:28.735
months but for the last 18 months
since BorisJohnson became Prime

731
00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:28.901
since Boris johnson became Prime
Minister.

732
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:30.068
since BorisJohnson became Prime
Minister. I assure you, I’ve been in

733
00:22:30.068 --> 00:22:30.360
Minister. Iassure you, I’ve been in
the

734
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.526
Minister. I assure you, I’ve been in
the committee rooms. I

735
00:22:31.526 --> 00:22:32.485
Minister. I assure you, I’ve been in
the committee rooms. Ijust want to

736
00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:33.693
the committee rooms. Ijust want to
let Malcolm in because he can’t

737
00:22:33.693 --> 00:22:33.860
the committee rooms. Ijust want to
let Malcolm in because he can’tjump

738
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.485
let Malcolm in because he can’t jump
in quite as

739
00:22:34.485 --> 00:22:35.485
let Malcolm in because he can’tjump
in quite as easily as you and he’s

740
00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:38.985
in quite as easily as you and he’s
had his hand up, Malcolm? Thanks,

741
00:22:38.985 --> 00:22:39.526
had his hand up, Malcolm? Thanks,
Fiona, ran I

742
00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:39.651
had his hand up, Malcolm? Thanks,
Fiona, ran Ijust

743
00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:42.068
had his hand up, Malcolm? Thanks,
Fiona, can Ijust inject an air of

744
00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:42.568
Fiona, ran Ijust inject an air of
perhaps

745
00:22:42.568 --> 00:22:43.568
Fiona, can Ijust inject an air of
perhaps perhaps objective realism

746
00:22:43.568 --> 00:22:46.193
perhaps perhaps objective realism
here. There’s an old political

747
00:22:46.193 --> 00:22:48.318
here. There’s an old political
saying in Australia, in the great

748
00:22:48.318 --> 00:22:49.776
saying in Australia, in the great
race of life, always back

749
00:22:49.776 --> 00:22:51.318
race of life, always back
self—interest, because you know it

750
00:22:51.318 --> 00:22:53.610
self-interest, because you know it
is trying. The

751
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.485
self—interest, because you know it
is trying. The reality is, Robert is

752
00:22:54.485 --> 00:22:57.068
is trying. The reality is, Robert is
right when he makes the point that

753
00:22:57.068 --> 00:22:59.235
right when he makes the point that
trade benefits both sides, and so,

754
00:22:59.235 --> 00:23:03.568
trade benefits both sides, and so,
you know, the Europeans have an

755
00:23:03.568 --> 00:23:05.318
you know, the Europeans have an
interest in having a good trading

756
00:23:05.318 --> 00:23:07.151
interest in having a good trading
relationship with Britain. I mean,

757
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:08.776
relationship with Britain. I mean,
they don’t want to suddenly freeze

758
00:23:08.776 --> 00:23:12.610
they don’t want to suddenly freeze
Britain out. They don’t buy British

759
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.026
Britain out. They don’t buy British
goods because they particularly like

760
00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:16.235
goods because they particularty like
the

761
00:23:16.235 --> 00:23:18.485
goods because they particularly like
the British, or... It is a

762
00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:18.943
the British, or... It is a
financial, commercial

763
00:23:18.943 --> 00:23:19.151
the British, or... It is a
financial, commercialthing.

764
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:19.985
financial, commercial thing.
However, here

765
00:23:19.985 --> 00:23:21.068
financial, commercialthing.
However, here is the point of

766
00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:22.693
However, here is the point of
reality. There is always a market

767
00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:25.360
reality. There is always a market
for protectionism politically.

768
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.151
for protectionism politically.
Politicians will always get

769
00:23:29.151 --> 00:23:33.401
Politicians will always get
applauded when they support or

770
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:33.901
applauded when they support or
protect local industries,

771
00:23:33.901 --> 00:23:35.443
protect local industries,
particularly those that are

772
00:23:35.443 --> 00:23:37.401
particularly those that are
influential. Now, Julia can say, oh,

773
00:23:37.401 --> 00:23:37.693
inﬂuential. Now, julia ran say, oh,
the Europeans

774
00:23:37.693 --> 00:23:38.818
influential. Now, Julia can say, oh,
the Europeans are punishing us by

775
00:23:38.818 --> 00:23:40.693
the Europeans are punishing us by
not giving us a good enough deal. I

776
00:23:40.693 --> 00:23:41.651
not giving us a good enough deal. I
mean, that is

777
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:41.776
not giving us a good enough deal. I
mean, that isjust

778
00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:42.943
not giving us a good enough deal. I
mean, that is just not right. They

779
00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:45.818
mean, that is just not right. They
are acting in their own rational

780
00:23:45.818 --> 00:23:46.735
are acting in their own rational
self interest. The British

781
00:23:46.735 --> 00:23:48.943
self interest. The British
government, in its negotiations on

782
00:23:48.943 --> 00:23:51.193
government, in its negotiations on
an Australian free—trade agreement,

783
00:23:51.193 --> 00:23:52.235
an Australian free-trade agreement,
and I have

784
00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:53.735
an Australian free—trade agreement,
and I have to say, Simon Birmingham

785
00:23:53.735 --> 00:23:54.568
and I have to say, Simon Birmingham
and Liz Tmss,

786
00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:55.401
and I have to say, Simon Birmingham
and Liz Truss, the respective trade

787
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:55.818
and Liz Tmss, the respective trade
ministers, are

788
00:23:55.818 --> 00:23:57.193
and Liz Truss, the respective trade
ministers, are doing an outstanding

789
00:23:57.193 --> 00:23:59.526
ministers, are doing an outstanding
job and working on that, but we

790
00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:01.651
job and working on that, but we
know, we are big agricultural

791
00:24:01.651 --> 00:24:03.318
know, we are big agricultural
exporters, we are very low cost

792
00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.235
exporters, we are very low cost
producers of agricultural products.

793
00:24:05.235 --> 00:24:08.193
producers of agricultural products.
We know that Britain is not going to

794
00:24:08.193 --> 00:24:09.443
We know that Britain is not going to
suddenly say, right, no barriers to

795
00:24:09.443 --> 00:24:12.276
suddenly say, right, no barriers to
Australian imports you know, of

796
00:24:12.276 --> 00:24:14.651
Australian imports you know, of
beef, lamb, etc. They are not going

797
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:17.485
beef, lamb, etc. They are not going
to do that because they’re farmers,

798
00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:17.735
to do that because therre farmers,
politically,

799
00:24:17.735 --> 00:24:19.818
to do that because they’re farmers,
politically, the farmers could not

800
00:24:19.818 --> 00:24:21.818
politically, the farmers could not
compete and politically, that is not

801
00:24:21.818 --> 00:24:23.235
compete and politically, that is not
going to be acceptable. 50 the

802
00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:23.651
going to be acceptabla. So the
question is,

803
00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:24.610
going to be acceptable. 50 the
question is, how much additional

804
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.276
question is, how much additional
access do we get to the European

805
00:24:27.276 --> 00:24:29.735
access do we get to the European
market? So it is not a question of

806
00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:31.276
market? So it is not a question of
punishing or anything like that.

807
00:24:31.276 --> 00:24:31.651
punishing or anything like that.
What it

808
00:24:31.651 --> 00:24:31.860
punishing or anything like that.
what it is,

809
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.318
punishing or anything like that.
What it is, is people pursue their

810
00:24:33.318 --> 00:24:34.360
what it is, is peopla pursue their
own

811
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.443
What it is, is people pursue their
own interest and when you step out

812
00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:38.901
own interest and when you step out
of a free trade zone, where there

813
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:42.568
of a free trade zone, where there
are no barriers, suddenly, people in

814
00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:43.693
are no barriers, suddenly, people in
France, Germany and elsewhere will

815
00:24:43.693 --> 00:24:45.360
France, Germany and elsewhere will
be saying, 0K,

816
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.693
France, Germany and elsewhere will
be saying, OK, the Brits have

817
00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:50.235
be saying, OK, the Brits have
stepped out, how does it benefit us

818
00:24:50.235 --> 00:24:52.276
stepped out, how does it benefit us
to give our firms and businesses and

819
00:24:52.276 --> 00:24:55.943
to give our firms and businesses and
farmers an edge over the ones in

820
00:24:55.943 --> 00:24:57.735
farmers an edge over the ones in
Britain? You know what? The British

821
00:24:57.735 --> 00:24:59.360
Britain? You know what? The British
government will be doing exactly the

822
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.401
government will be doing exactly the
same thing with other countries. You

823
00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:05.610
same thing with other countries. You
know, it is a big, brave world out

824
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:10.151
know, it is a big, brave world out
there, and you know, I have huge

825
00:25:10.151 --> 00:25:11.776
there, and you know, I have huge
confidence in Britain. I think you

826
00:25:11.776 --> 00:25:13.151
confidence in Britain. I think you
will do brilliantly but it is

827
00:25:13.151 --> 00:25:15.901
will do brilliantly but it is
going... But you have to be clearer

828
00:25:15.901 --> 00:25:17.735
going... But you have to be clearer
about it and recognise there will be

829
00:25:17.735 --> 00:25:19.151
about it and recognise there will be
an economic cost and then you have

830
00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:20.860
an economic cost and then you have
got to come you know, sales force

831
00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.735
got to come you know, sales force
and do your best in a very

832
00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:25.151
and do your best in a very
competitive environment. 0K, we

833
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:26.360
competitive environment. 0K, we
could obviously talk about this for

834
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.735
could obviously talk about this for
a long time but there’s other

835
00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:29.651
a long time but there’s other
questions I want to get into tonight

836
00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:31.276
questions I want to get into tonight
and before I go ahead to the next

837
00:25:31.276 --> 00:25:32.443
and before I go ahead to the next
question, I want to mention that

838
00:25:32.443 --> 00:25:34.860
question, I want to mention that
we’re starting a new kind of

870
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.651
are. Let’s take our next question.
Martin Beckwith Brown.

871
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:19.526
The Covid virus does not have legs
walking around looking for victims.

872
00:26:19.526 --> 00:26:21.860
The growth in infections,
hospitalisations and subsequent

873
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.151
deaths is due to many not
following the guidelines correctly.

874
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.818
Shouldn’t people be taking more
personal responsibility

875
00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:31.485
to safeguard others?

876
00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:31.901
to safeguard others?

877
00:26:34.443 --> 00:26:38.110
ﬂ

878
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.610
Iimagine you

879
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.360
I imagine you are asking this
question because you have experience

880
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.818
question because you have experience
of this or because it is something

881
00:26:42.818 --> 00:26:45.026
of this or because it is something
that particularly irritate you?

882
00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:45.235
that particularty irritate you?
Both,

883
00:26:45.235 --> 00:26:46.526
that particularly irritate you?
Both, actually! It is everywhere you

884
00:26:46.526 --> 00:26:52.360
Both, actually! It is everywhere you
look. I hear reports on the TV and

885
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.151
look. I hear reports on the TV and
elsewhere, oh, it is a minority, but

886
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:56.985
elsewhere, oh, it is a minority, but
the trouble is, you don’t have to

887
00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:58.901
the troubla is, you don’t have to
relax too

888
00:26:58.901 --> 00:27:01.401
the trouble is, you don’t have to
relax too much to create the

889
00:27:01.401 --> 00:27:04.360
relax too much to create the
problem. You know, in Essex, we have

890
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.776
problem. You know, in Essex, we have
been historically quite low and it

891
00:27:07.776 --> 00:27:11.526
been historically quite low and it
is starting to go through the roof.

892
00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:12.776
is starting to go through the roof.
And... Peopla,

893
00:27:12.776 --> 00:27:13.568
is starting to go through the roof.
And... People, you know, I

894
00:27:13.568 --> 00:27:14.276
is starting to go through the roof.
And... People, you know, Iwas in a

895
00:27:14.276 --> 00:27:16.235
And... Peopla, you know, Iwas in a
supermarket this

896
00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:16.985
And... People, you know, Iwas in a
supermarket this morning and there

897
00:27:16.985 --> 00:27:18.818
supermarket this morning and there
were... 0K, there were only two or

898
00:27:18.818 --> 00:27:20.360
were... 0K, there were only two or
three people without masks but there

899
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.026
three people without masks but there
were still three people without

900
00:27:25.026 --> 00:27:26.151
were still three people without
masks and they were young, fit

901
00:27:26.151 --> 00:27:29.526
masks and they were young, fit
people. We know that there are

902
00:27:29.526 --> 00:27:33.776
people. We know that there are
people going in and out of homes, I

903
00:27:33.776 --> 00:27:35.360
people going in and out of homes, I
even talk to publicans, and they say

904
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.151
even talk to public-ans, and they say
in the area,

905
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:37.068
even talk to publicans, and they say
in the area, there are pubs that are

906
00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:39.985
in the area, there are pubs that are
not following the rules and they are

907
00:27:39.985 --> 00:27:40.193
not following the mles and they are
upset

908
00:27:40.193 --> 00:27:41.193
not following the rules and they are
upset because they are doing the

909
00:27:41.193 --> 00:27:44.193
upset because they are doing the
right thing and losing trade. 0K,

910
00:27:44.193 --> 00:27:49.818
right thing and losing trade. OK,
let’s take to the panel, Wes, we

911
00:27:49.818 --> 00:27:50.818
let’s take to the panel, Wes, we
have seen the Health Secretary

912
00:27:50.818 --> 00:27:52.193
have seen the Health Secretary
talking today about infections

913
00:27:52.193 --> 00:27:53.985
talking today about infections
rising, particular in areas of the

914
00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:55.443
rising, particular in areas of the
south—east so should people take

915
00:27:55.443 --> 00:27:55.526
south-east so should peopla take
more

916
00:27:55.526 --> 00:27:57.818
south—east so should people take
more responsibility? Yes, this is a

917
00:27:57.818 --> 00:27:59.318
more responsibility? Yes, this is a
really big constituency for me, lots

918
00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:00.985
really big constituency for me, lots
of you will know my constituency, of

919
00:28:00.985 --> 00:28:02.443
of you will know my constituency, of
the North, is on the London Essex

920
00:28:02.443 --> 00:28:02.526
the North, is on the London Fssex
border

921
00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:03.735
the North, is on the London Essex
border and we’ve got some of the

922
00:28:03.735 --> 00:28:05.943
border and we’ve got some of the
highest infection rates London, our

923
00:28:05.943 --> 00:28:08.026
highest infection rates London, our
part of London and Essex has rates

924
00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:09.526
part of London and Essex has rates
rising at this week hospitals in my

925
00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:13.235
rising at this week hospitals in my
community have the numbers of deaths

926
00:28:13.235 --> 00:28:15.068
community have the numbers of deaths
unlike that which they have seen

927
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.568
unlike that which they have seen
since the first peak. We can’t be

928
00:28:16.568 --> 00:28:18.443
since the first peak. We can’t be
complacent about this. The fact the

929
00:28:18.443 --> 00:28:19.818
complacent about this. The fact the
vaccine is being rolled out is of

930
00:28:19.818 --> 00:28:21.235
vaccine is being rolled out is of
course a huge relief, not least for

931
00:28:21.235 --> 00:28:22.610
course a huge relief, not least for
those of us who are desperate for

932
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.068
those of us who are desperate for
many of our own family members to

933
00:28:24.068 --> 00:28:26.485
many of our own family members to
get the vaccine where they are

934
00:28:26.485 --> 00:28:27.651
get the vaccine where they are
older, more vulnerable, so we can’t

935
00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:27.985
older, more vulnerabla, so we can’t
wait for

936
00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:29.276
older, more vulnerable, so we can’t
wait for that but we have come so

937
00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:31.068
wait for that but we have come so
far, we have made so many

938
00:28:31.068 --> 00:28:33.443
far, we have made so many
sacrifices, let’s not throw it away

939
00:28:33.443 --> 00:28:36.235
sacrifices, let’s not throw it away
at this late stage. Let’s exercise

940
00:28:36.235 --> 00:28:37.276
at this late stage. Let’s exercise
in personal responsibility, take

941
00:28:37.276 --> 00:28:37.568
in personal responsibility, take
rare, look

942
00:28:37.568 --> 00:28:38.568
in personal responsibility, take
care, look out for each other and

943
00:28:38.568 --> 00:28:39.110
rare, look out for each other and
make sure

944
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.943
care, look out for each other and
make sure we get through this

945
00:28:39.943 --> 00:28:42.068
make sure we get through this
pandemic as well as possible. There

946
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.818
pandemic as well as possible. There
are lots of people in this country

947
00:28:43.818 --> 00:28:43.985
are lots of peopla in this country
who

948
00:28:43.985 --> 00:28:45.318
are lots of people in this country
who have had covert micro who are

949
00:28:45.318 --> 00:28:46.693
who have had covert micro who are
still suffering from Long Covid

950
00:28:46.693 --> 00:28:49.651
still suffering from Long Covid
symptoms and let’s not forget as we

951
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:51.401
symptoms and let’s not forget as we
approach Christmas, over 60,000

952
00:28:51.401 --> 00:28:51.860
approach Christmas, over 60,000
peopla have

953
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.443
approach Christmas, over 60,000
people have died during this

954
00:28:52.443 --> 00:28:52.568
peopla have died during this
pandemic

955
00:28:52.568 --> 00:28:53.610
people have died during this
pandemic and for lots of families,

956
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.610
pandemic and for lots of families,
this is going to be a really hard

957
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.151
this is going to be a really hard
Christmas when they are missing

958
00:28:58.151 --> 00:28:58.568
Christmas when they are missing
peopla for

959
00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:00.193
Christmas when they are missing
people for the first time around

960
00:29:00.193 --> 00:29:00.443
peopla for the first time around
Christmas,

961
00:29:00.443 --> 00:29:01.860
people for the first time around
Christmas, so let’s keep all of that

962
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.026
Christmas, so let’s keep all of that
in mind and do the right thing,

963
00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:05.276
in mind and do the right thing,
follow the rules, look out for

964
00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.235
follow the rules, look out for
ourselves and each other, knowing

965
00:29:07.235 --> 00:29:08.610
ourselves and each other, knowing
the vaccine is being rolled out and

966
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:08.985
the vaccine is being rolled out and
we ran

967
00:29:08.985 --> 00:29:11.360
the vaccine is being rolled out and
we can look hopefully to a brighter

968
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.193
we ran look hopefully to a brighter
year in 2021.

969
00:29:13.193 --> 00:29:15.360
we can look hopefully to a brighter
year in 2021. Julia? Yes, I think

970
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.901
year in 2021. julia? Yes, Ithink
peopla should

971
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:16.985
year in 2021. Julia? Yes, I think
people should take more personal

972
00:29:16.985 --> 00:29:18.443
people should take more personal
responsibility but I would like that

973
00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:20.568
responsibility but I would like that
to be in place of having

974
00:29:20.568 --> 00:29:22.068
to be in place of having
restrictions on people’s right to

975
00:29:22.068 --> 00:29:23.901
restrictions on people’s right to
use their personal

976
00:29:23.901 --> 00:29:24.401
restrictions on people’s right to
use their personaljudgment and

977
00:29:24.401 --> 00:29:28.443
use their personaljudgment and
common sense. The Prime Minister has

978
00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:29.735
common sense. The Prime Minister has
constantly talked about good old

979
00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:31.610
constantly talked about good old
British common sense and personal

980
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.193
British common sense and personal
responsibility. So how would that

981
00:29:33.193 --> 00:29:34.776
responsibility. So how would that
work in practice? That would work in

982
00:29:34.776 --> 00:29:36.610
work in practice? That would work in
practice in that we would trust that

983
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:36.985
practice in that we would trust that
peopla will

984
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:38.151
practice in that we would trust that
people will do the right thing

985
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.485
people will do the right thing
because most people have actually

986
00:29:39.485 --> 00:29:42.401
because most people have actually
been following the rules. Martin

987
00:29:42.401 --> 00:29:44.485
been following the rules. Martin
mentions that a few people aren’t

988
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:45.651
mentions that a few people aren’t
wearing masks. We don’t know the

989
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:47.235
wearing masks. We don’t know the
reason why those people weren’t

990
00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:48.818
reason why those people weren’t
wearing masks and I see people on

991
00:29:48.818 --> 00:29:49.235
wearing masks and I see peopla on
the tube

992
00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:50.193
wearing masks and I see people on
the tube everyday, odd people not

993
00:29:50.193 --> 00:29:51.860
the tube everyday, odd people not
wearing masks but the vast majority

994
00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.443
wearing masks but the vast majority
are. The vast majority of publicans

995
00:29:54.443 --> 00:29:54.818
are. The vast majority of public-ans
and

996
00:29:54.818 --> 00:29:56.443
are. The vast majority of publicans
and restaurants and shops, people

997
00:29:56.443 --> 00:29:56.818
and restaurants and shops, peopla
going into

998
00:29:56.818 --> 00:29:57.610
and restaurants and shops, people
going into them, people are going

999
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:57.776
going into them, peopla are going
about

1000
00:29:57.776 --> 00:29:59.235
going into them, people are going
about their daily lives and their

1001
00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:00.568
about their daily lives and their
workplaces are doing very sensible

1002
00:30:00.568 --> 00:30:02.443
workplaces are doing very sensible
things. They are doing it because

1003
00:30:02.443 --> 00:30:04.443
things. They are doing it because
they want to keep themselves, their

1004
00:30:04.443 --> 00:30:04.860
they want to keep themselves, their
colleagues, their

1005
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.110
they want to keep themselves, their
colleagues, theirfamily members

1006
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.360
they want to keep themselves, their
colleagues, their family members and

1007
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.610
colleagues, their family members and
friends, people they pass in the

1008
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.193
friends, people they pass in the
street, they want to keep them safe.

wire

1010
00:30:10.568 --> 00:30:11.776
street, they want to keep them safe.
Wire infections rising then? Because

1011
00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:12.235
wire infections rising then? Because
we have

1012
00:30:12.235 --> 00:30:13.610
Wire infections rising then? Because
we have a virus which is now endemic

1013
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.943
we have a virus which is now endemic
and if you look at the patterns of

1014
00:30:15.943 --> 00:30:16.985
and if you look at the patterns of
this pandemic, in every single

1015
00:30:16.985 --> 00:30:19.443
this pandemic, in every single
country in the world, where there

1016
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:20.735
country in the world, where there
you compare Sweden, which did not

1017
00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:22.860
you compare Sweden, which did not
have a formal lockdown at all and

1018
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.943
have a formal lockdown at all and
did rely on personal responsibility,

1019
00:30:24.943 --> 00:30:26.193
did rely on personal responsibility,
or Peru, which locked down for

1020
00:30:26.193 --> 00:30:27.568
or Peru, which locked down for
months and months on end, not even

1021
00:30:27.568 --> 00:30:29.026
months and months on end, not even
allowing men and women out of their

1022
00:30:29.026 --> 00:30:32.235
allowing men and women out of their
homes on the same day, we have seen

1023
00:30:32.235 --> 00:30:33.443
homes on the same day, we have seen
exactly the same curve, the areas

1024
00:30:33.443 --> 00:30:35.818
exactly the same curve, the areas
where we are seeing the virus rise

1025
00:30:35.818 --> 00:30:37.568
where we are seeing the virus rise
in infection rates at the moment are

1026
00:30:37.568 --> 00:30:39.235
in infection rates at the moment are
the areas that were not hit back in

1027
00:30:39.235 --> 00:30:42.235
the areas that were not hit back in
the spring before we locked down. We

1028
00:30:42.235 --> 00:30:44.276
the spring before we locked down. We
are in the winter months. It is

1029
00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:45.735
are in the winter months. It is
rising in London and London was very

1030
00:30:45.735 --> 00:30:48.068
rising in London and London was very
badly hit? In the borough that were

1031
00:30:48.068 --> 00:30:49.985
badly hit? In the borough that were
not badly hit before the lockdown,

1032
00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:51.401
not badly hit before the lockdown,
if you look at the actual granular

1033
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:54.276
if you look at the actual granular
data, it is rising only in areas,

1034
00:30:54.276 --> 00:30:56.401
data, it is rising only in areas,
favouring, for instance, it is not

1035
00:30:56.401 --> 00:30:59.151
favouring, for instance, it is not
rising at very large levels anywhere

1036
00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:01.318
rising at very large levels anywhere
else that was hit much earlier in

1037
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:01.943
else that was hit much eartier in
the year. The

1038
00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:04.026
else that was hit much earlier in
the year. The reality is that we

1039
00:31:04.026 --> 00:31:05.443
the year. The reality is that we
have got a vaccine, we should be

1040
00:31:05.443 --> 00:31:07.068
have got a vaccine, we should be
making sure we are absolutely

1041
00:31:07.068 --> 00:31:08.818
making sure we are absolutely
protecting the vulnerable, those who

1042
00:31:08.818 --> 00:31:10.860
protecting the vulnerable, those who
are over 70, under 70,

1043
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.026
protecting the vulnerable, those who
are over70, under70, with

1044
00:31:11.026 --> 00:31:11.235
are over 70, under 70, with
undertying

1045
00:31:11.235 --> 00:31:13.068
are over70, under70, with
underlying health conditions, but in

1046
00:31:13.068 --> 00:31:13.818
undertying health conditions, but in
my view we

1047
00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:14.776
underlying health conditions, but in
my view we should not be having

1048
00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:17.235
my view we should not be having
restrictions on shops opening or

1049
00:31:17.235 --> 00:31:19.026
restrictions on shops opening or
closing, on pubs or restaurants,

1050
00:31:19.026 --> 00:31:21.235
closing, on pubs or restaurants,
there is no evidence whatsoever that

1051
00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:22.860
there is no evidence whatsoever that
any of these particular places are

1052
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.776
any of these particular places are
causing a rise in infections. On the

1053
00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:26.318
causing a rise in infections. On the
contrary, lots of evidence that when

1054
00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:28.318
contrary, lots of evidence that when
you have a lockdown, as Wales did,

1055
00:31:28.318 --> 00:31:28.610
you have a lockdown, as Walas did,
and are

1056
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.776
you have a lockdown, as Wales did,
and are planning to again, or when

1057
00:31:29.776 --> 00:31:32.235
and are planning to again, or when
you have a lockdown as England did,

1058
00:31:32.235 --> 00:31:32.818
you have a lockdown as England did,
for four weeks,

1059
00:31:32.818 --> 00:31:33.776
you have a lockdown as England did,
forfour weeks, you end up

1060
00:31:33.776 --> 00:31:34.026
for four weeks, you end up
increasing

1061
00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:34.985
forfour weeks, you end up
increasing the problem afterwards.

1062
00:31:34.985 --> 00:31:36.610
increasing the problem afterwards.
They don’t solve anything or break

1063
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.276
They don’t solve anything or break
any circuits or any fires, all they

1064
00:31:39.276 --> 00:31:41.235
any circuits or any fires, all they
do is delay the problem. I think we

1065
00:31:41.235 --> 00:31:44.151
do is delay the problem. I think we
should rely on adults in this

1066
00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:45.735
should rely on adults in this
country and trust their personal

1067
00:31:45.735 --> 00:31:46.526
country and trust their personal
judgment about keeping themselves

1068
00:31:46.526 --> 00:31:49.026
judgment about keeping themselves
and other people safe and as they

1069
00:31:49.026 --> 00:31:49.193
and other peopla safe and as they
have

1070
00:31:49.193 --> 00:31:51.610
and other people safe and as they
have been doing anyway, and allow

1071
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.318
have been doing anyway, and allow
peopla to go

1072
00:31:52.318 --> 00:31:52.985
have been doing anyway, and allow
people to go about their normal

1073
00:31:52.985 --> 00:31:53.485
peopla to go about their normal
daily lives as

1074
00:31:53.485 --> 00:31:56.401
people to go about their normal
daily lives as much as possible.

1075
00:31:56.401 --> 00:31:58.818
daily lives as much as possible.
Anand. Obviously, people should take

1076
00:31:58.818 --> 00:31:58.985
Anand. Obviously, peopla should take
responsibility

1077
00:31:58.985 --> 00:31:59.526
Anand. Obviously, people should take
responsibility for themselves and

1078
00:31:59.526 --> 00:32:00.860
responsibility for themselves and
others and there’s been some really

1079
00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.443
others and there’s been some really
interesting survey data from you

1080
00:32:02.443 --> 00:32:03.610
interesting survey data from you
because that showed the majority of

1081
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.068
because that showed the majority of
people who said they would take a

1082
00:32:05.068 --> 00:32:05.235
peopla who said they would take a
vaccine

1083
00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:06.276
people who said they would take a
vaccine would take it not because

1084
00:32:06.276 --> 00:32:07.443
vaccine would take it not because
the government told them so but

1085
00:32:07.443 --> 00:32:09.276
the government told them so but
because they thought it would help

1086
00:32:09.276 --> 00:32:11.401
because they thought it would help
others. I think that is community

1087
00:32:11.401 --> 00:32:13.860
others. I think that is community
spirit that exists in this country.

1088
00:32:16.068 --> 00:32:18.443
I disagree withJulia
on the lockdown and it is

1089
00:32:18.443 --> 00:32:21.526
interesting that in the last week
of November, the 21st of the 27th,

1090
00:32:21.526 --> 00:32:22.776
that the death toll failed...

1091
00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:25.860
That was a leg from the infections,
the infection rate went down before

1092
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.026
we went into lockdown,
that is official ONS data.

1093
00:32:28.026 --> 00:32:32.610
It is not, I don’t think...

1094
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.485
The death rate went down,
as it always does, with the time—lag

1095
00:32:35.485 --> 00:32:36.901
from the infection rates going down.

1096
00:32:36.901 --> 00:32:39.818
The same for the first lockdown,
the infection rate was going down

1097
00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:40.985
before we went into lockdown.

1098
00:32:40.985 --> 00:32:43.443
Over the two weeks before
the English lockdown was announced,

1099
00:32:43.443 --> 00:32:45.818
on the 31st of October,
cases rose by 29%, hospitalisations

1100
00:32:45.818 --> 00:32:47.485
rose by 50%, deaths rose by 137%.

1101
00:32:47.485 --> 00:32:50.401
The data that was given out,
the data that was used has

1102
00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:52.985
since been gone through and even
at the time, that was

1103
00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.068
being questioned.

1104
00:32:54.068 --> 00:32:57.443
The data that was used at that time
was already weeks out of date.

1105
00:32:57.443 --> 00:32:59.110
Yes, but the cases
were still rising.

1106
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.026
The cases were rising
at a lower rate.

1107
00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:02.235
No, they weren’t doing that...

1108
00:33:02.235 --> 00:33:04.401
0K, sojust to be clear,
they were rising.

1109
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:07.026
The rate of increase was slowing,
it was actually already levelling

1110
00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:09.860
off and going down in some areas
before we went into lockdown.

1111
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.943
That is official data.

1112
00:33:10.943 --> 00:33:12.860
Anand, I will let
you finish your point.

1113
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.985
0K, we could trace the defence
but I think there are other aspects

1114
00:33:15.985 --> 00:33:18.151
to this than people doing
what is common sense.

1115
00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:21.026
I mean, I don’t understand
what common sense is but I think

1116
00:33:21.026 --> 00:33:23.651
there’s a real important role
for government here and I think

1117
00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:25.360
there are several things to be said.

1118
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.235
One, the government has to be clear
and consistent in its messaging.

1119
00:33:28.235 --> 00:33:31.360
Now, what the Welsh case shows me
is not that lockdown doesn’t work.

1120
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.735
It is just that if you lockdown then
open the taps, everyone floods out

1121
00:33:34.735 --> 00:33:37.110
again and itjust leads to more
rises in infections.

1122
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.485
You need to be steady
and gradual about these things.

1123
00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:42.860
There is a bit of a tendency
at the moment to say, don’t worry,

1124
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.485
at Christmas we can all go out
and that, you know,

1125
00:33:45.485 --> 00:33:47.901
as we have from Chris Whitty
and Patrick Vallance yesterday

1126
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:50.318
in Parliament, is possibly
going to lead to an increase

1127
00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:51.401
in cases inJanuary.

1128
00:33:51.401 --> 00:33:53.985
So we need to think carefully
through what government strategy is.

1129
00:33:53.985 --> 00:33:56.610
And the final thing is,
the guidelines need to be clear

1130
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.985
and those in power need to be shown
to be respecting them as well.

1131
00:33:59.985 --> 00:34:03.401
You know, I don’t want to harp
on about this but the damage done

1132
00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:05.735
by the Barnard Castle trip,
because the moment that people

1133
00:34:05.735 --> 00:34:07.901
think, "Either that lot aren’t
listening to the rules,

1134
00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:10.776
or actually, the rules are a bit
silly", Scotch eggs in pubs,

1135
00:34:10.776 --> 00:34:13.193
and actually, once you start
thinking the rules are silly,

1136
00:34:13.193 --> 00:34:15.568
then the whole thing starts
to fray at the edges.

1137
00:34:15.568 --> 00:34:19.276
Well, what if you allow government
to tell you what you can and can’t

1138
00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:22.193
eat and where you can and can’t
eat in a free country,

1139
00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:23.568
that gets a bit silly, too.

1140
00:34:23.568 --> 00:34:26.443
Well, let’s hear from the audience
because there’s lots of hands up

1141
00:34:26.443 --> 00:34:28.610
and I would like to hear from you.
Chﬂs?

1142
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.318
Thank you.
It seems to me that...

1143
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:33.735
We have proven already that
common sense doesn’t work

1144
00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:36.693
so I think we need to take
a different approach.

1145
00:34:36.693 --> 00:34:40.193
And why not to be a lot
more granular about it?

1146
00:34:40.193 --> 00:34:43.026
Rather than going countywide or even
countrywide in the case of Wales,

1147
00:34:43.026 --> 00:34:47.568
why don’t we focus on the areas
where it is really happening?

1148
00:34:47.568 --> 00:34:51.901
So in Basildon, for example,
which is the case that is being

1149
00:34:51.901 --> 00:34:56.860
cited in Essex at the moment,
it is not throughout Basildon that

1150
00:34:56.943 --> 00:34:59.568
there’s the problem,
it is in certain areas, so why don’t

1151
00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:00.735
we just attacked those areas?

1152
00:35:00.735 --> 00:35:01.818
Diane?

1153
00:35:01.818 --> 00:35:03.735
I actually think that
the government’s policy

1154
00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:08.776
on Christmas is ludicrous.

1155
00:35:09.943 --> 00:35:12.943
We are all going to get together,
well, I’m personally not,

1156
00:35:12.943 --> 00:35:15.401
we’re not, and people,
families are going to get together,

1157
00:35:15.401 --> 00:35:18.276
have a drink, cuddle each other
when they should not be cuddling

1158
00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:23.318
each other, and doesjulia really
think that we are not

1159
00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:26.526
going to have a lockdown
after Christmas?

1160
00:35:26.526 --> 00:35:29.901
I am sure we will.

1161
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:34.943
Jimmy?
Thank you.

1162
00:35:35.068 --> 00:35:36.985
I think there’s a degree
of conformity fatigue

1163
00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:39.901
with a lot of people,
and the problem is that the message

1164
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:43.193
has been so blurred and so varied
over such along period of time,

1165
00:35:43.193 --> 00:35:45.360
that now, conspiracy theories
have a lot more gravity

1166
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.026
and they have a lot more attachment
than they would ordinarily.

1167
00:35:48.026 --> 00:35:50.401
I think people are looking
for an opportunity to not

1168
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:51.443
conform any longer.

1169
00:35:51.443 --> 00:35:52.985
People are tired of it.

1170
00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:55.610
That’s largely because of the mixed
messages and the flip—flopping that

1171
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.526
has been done I think
from the government.

1172
00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:02.485
And Malcolm, Australia took
a different path to the UK

1173
00:36:02.985 --> 00:36:05.818
in a number of ways,
in terms of dealing with a lockdown.

1174
00:36:05.818 --> 00:36:08.276
Where do you stand in terms
ofJulia’s let people

1175
00:36:08.276 --> 00:36:13.235
take their own responsibility for it
versus the role of the government?

1176
00:36:14.193 --> 00:36:16.526
Well, I think the government
has got a huge role.

1177
00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:18.443
We are a Federation,
so national, federal government,

1178
00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:20.568
six states and two territories.

1179
00:36:20.568 --> 00:36:25.443
Much of the heavy lifting was done
at the state and territory level,

1180
00:36:25.443 --> 00:36:29.318
so a number of the...

1181
00:36:29.318 --> 00:36:31.985
Excuse me, a number of the states
actually closed their borders.

1182
00:36:31.985 --> 00:36:34.610
In fact, at different times,
all the states closed their borders

1183
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.526
against other states.

1184
00:36:36.526 --> 00:36:41.526
We had a much...

1185
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:46.985
I think we went harder on lockdowns
and in particular, on the borders,

1186
00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:48.901
the international borders,
sooner, than many other countries

1187
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:52.693
did including the UK.

1188
00:36:52.693 --> 00:36:57.401
And you know, the reality is,
I mean, this is a very complex area

1189
00:36:57.401 --> 00:37:00.276
and I don’t want to oversimplify
but it is obvious that this

1190
00:37:00.276 --> 00:37:01.776
is a highly infectious disease.

1191
00:37:01.776 --> 00:37:06.651
And so, the more...

1192
00:37:06.651 --> 00:37:09.568
The way to stop it spreading,
as the gentleman from the audience

1193
00:37:09.568 --> 00:37:12.651
said, it does not have arms
and legs, it is spread by people,

1194
00:37:12.651 --> 00:37:15.068
you have got to have social
distancing, you have got

1195
00:37:15.068 --> 00:37:16.151
to wear masks.

1196
00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:18.318
The sooner you can impose
those measures, the less

1197
00:37:18.318 --> 00:37:19.360
transmission you will get.

1198
00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.193
Australia has had
a relatively good experience.

1199
00:37:22.193 --> 00:37:25.901
We really...

1200
00:37:25.901 --> 00:37:29.360
You know, we sympathise
with the rough time the British

1201
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.026
people are going through,
and you know, we wish

1202
00:37:32.026 --> 00:37:35.485
you all the best, we wish
there was something we could do

1203
00:37:35.485 --> 00:37:40.443
to help from this end and I hope
that vaccines are distributed

1204
00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:44.651
as rapidly as possible, but I think
what we have learned globally

1205
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:48.860
from this pandemic is that
early action is best.

1206
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.318
You know, the proposition
that people should just

1207
00:37:51.318 --> 00:37:55.693
be free to do whatever
they like is pretty naive, frankly.

1208
00:37:55.693 --> 00:37:59.318
It sounds good as a political sound
bite but it does not work out very

1209
00:37:59.318 --> 00:38:00.735
well in the intensive care unit.

1210
00:38:00.735 --> 00:38:02.485
And Malcolm, can I ask you...

1211
00:38:02.485 --> 00:38:05.401
Interestingly, the country that has
done the best of all is Taiwan.

1212
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:08.151
Can Ijustjump infora minute?

1213
00:38:08.151 --> 00:38:11.943
Sure.

1214
00:38:11.943 --> 00:38:13.860
You say acting quickly
was critical for Australia.

1215
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.443
Do you think the UK
Government acted too slowly?

1216
00:38:16.443 --> 00:38:20.651
Well, it did not act
as quickly as Australia did.

1217
00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:25.651
Ultimately, Fiona, every country
in the world, you know,

1218
00:38:25.985 --> 00:38:30.401
at similar stages of development,
is dealing with the same issues,

1219
00:38:30.401 --> 00:38:34.443
you know, Robert is dealing
with the same justice issues

1220
00:38:34.443 --> 00:38:36.610
as his Australian counterparts are,
as his French counterparts

1221
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.693
are, and so forth.

1222
00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:42.860
What is interesting
about the pandemic, it is like

1223
00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.193
an old—fashioned examination.

1224
00:38:44.193 --> 00:38:49.151
I mean, every country in the world
had to face exactly the same problem

1225
00:38:50.485 --> 00:38:53.943
at exactly the same time.

1226
00:38:53.943 --> 00:38:55.818
It was like being in
the examination hall,

1227
00:38:55.818 --> 00:38:57.985
where the invigilator says," Right,
it is nine o’clock,

1228
00:38:57.985 --> 00:38:59.943
you can start writing,
you’ve got three hours".

1229
00:38:59.943 --> 00:39:04.610
And so, we can actually test in real
time what approaches worked best.

1230
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.985
And I think a key thing, of course,
there are cultural issues,

1231
00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:12.360
obviously, the more trust
and confidence people have

1232
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.235
in the government, the better,
the more likely they are to take

1233
00:39:15.235 --> 00:39:16.276
guidance from the government.

1234
00:39:16.276 --> 00:39:18.193
The point Anand made
about leadership and consistency

1235
00:39:18.193 --> 00:39:21.901
is a very powerful one.

1236
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:26.151
So, you know, I think the reality
is, social distancing, masks,

1237
00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:30.151
all of those old techniques that
have been around for centuries,

1238
00:39:30.151 --> 00:39:33.235
probably millennia as well,
have been the most effective.

1239
00:39:33.235 --> 00:39:36.318
Robert.

1240
00:39:36.318 --> 00:39:40.401
Well, here we are, towards the end
of an extraordinary year,

1241
00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:43.151
having been in a position
of responsibility throughout this

1242
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:47.276
crisis, I can tell you that
Malcolm’s characterisation of it

1243
00:39:47.276 --> 00:39:50.651
being one giant exam question
is probably a very good one.

1244
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:53.110
I think, like all other
governments in the world,

1245
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:58.110
we have had to learn on the job.

1246
00:39:58.276 --> 00:40:00.193
And what mark would you
give the government?

1247
00:40:00.193 --> 00:40:01.401
If it is an exam?

1248
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:04.276
I’m not going to start marking
the government because we are not

1249
00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:05.443
out of the woods yet.

1250
00:40:05.443 --> 00:40:08.110
We are still in a position
where this virus is very

1251
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.151
much in our community.

1252
00:40:09.151 --> 00:40:10.860
The vaccine has started to arrive.

1253
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.485
That’s great but we can’t
take our foot off the pedal.

1254
00:40:13.485 --> 00:40:15.651
We have got to keep
dealing with this problem,

1255
00:40:15.651 --> 00:40:20.651
wherever we see it.

1256
00:40:21.443 --> 00:40:23.401
And what about Diane’s
point about she thinks

1257
00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:25.818
it is ridiculous that
people are being allowed to get

1258
00:40:25.818 --> 00:40:26.901
together at Christmas?

1259
00:40:26.901 --> 00:40:29.485
I think it was right of us
to recognise that Christmas

1260
00:40:29.485 --> 00:40:31.443
is a particularty important time
of the year.

1261
00:40:31.443 --> 00:40:36.443
I think within that,
a lot of people, a lot of families,

1262
00:40:36.943 --> 00:40:39.068
are making decisions and I’m,
certainly from my expense,

1263
00:40:39.068 --> 00:40:43.318
talking to lots of families
who are going to exercise restraint.

1264
00:40:43.318 --> 00:40:44.735
Here’s that thing:

1265
00:40:44.735 --> 00:40:47.860
I think there is clearly a role
for government in setting a plan.

1266
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.985
We have the Covid winter plan that
did notjust involve a lockdown,

1267
00:40:50.985 --> 00:40:54.443
it involved a return to different
tiers, which I think was very

1268
00:40:54.443 --> 00:40:57.068
important, rather than just letting
everything hang out after the end

1269
00:40:57.068 --> 00:40:58.068
of the lockdown.

1270
00:40:58.068 --> 00:41:00.110
I think that will help
make a difference.

1271
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:04.985
But at the same time, this is not
just about government activity,

1272
00:41:04.985 --> 00:41:07.860
it is about each and every one
of us and government...

1273
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.026
Yes, trust is a big issue
but government has to show that it

1274
00:41:11.026 --> 00:41:13.443
trusts people as well
and that is why I think

1275
00:41:13.443 --> 00:41:16.526
it is important that in terms
of the messaging that we give out,

1276
00:41:16.526 --> 00:41:18.443
that we don’t sound
ineffectively authoritarian.

1277
00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:23.485
In other words, we don’t become too
shrill and we don’t become

1278
00:41:24.068 --> 00:41:27.401
too didactic because we could not
achieve the progress that we have

1279
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:31.901
done without the cooperation
and the solidarity of the people

1280
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:34.568
of this country — all of us
have played our part

1281
00:41:34.568 --> 00:41:36.985
in dealing with this virus,
and the government trusts people

1282
00:41:36.985 --> 00:41:40.276
to do the right thing.

1283
00:41:40.276 --> 00:41:43.443
We have a regime in place to deal
with those cases where people

1284
00:41:43.443 --> 00:41:48.401
are behaving in a way
that is clearly irresponsible

1285
00:41:49.985 --> 00:41:52.443
and we have seen a lot
of fines being issued,

1286
00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:53.568
a lot of enforcement action.

1287
00:41:53.568 --> 00:41:55.985
It did not work with
Dominic Cummings, though, did it?

1288
00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:58.193
Well, look, I take the point
about personal responsibility,

1289
00:41:58.193 --> 00:41:59.235
personal examples.

1290
00:41:59.235 --> 00:42:02.318
I think that episodes like that,
whether it is people who at some

1291
00:42:02.318 --> 00:42:05.151
point have been involved
in politics, no more, but you know,

1292
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:07.526
celebrities and other people,
it is clearly having an impact

1293
00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:08.901
on all of us.

1294
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:11.318
So, do you think he did break
the guidelines, then?

1295
00:42:11.318 --> 00:42:12.360
Of course he did.

1296
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.610
Of course he did.

1297
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:19.526
And it was one rule for him
and another for everyone else.

1298
00:42:19.526 --> 00:42:21.151
It was an absolute outrage.

1299
00:42:21.151 --> 00:42:24.485
It was a deeply unfortunate episode,
there is no doubt about that and it

1300
00:42:24.485 --> 00:42:26.901
didn’t help when it came to creating
a consistent message.

1301
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:29.818
But I think one of the contributors
making this point about fatigue

1302
00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:32.901
and about people feeling this
is an awfully long road, we have got

1303
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:34.151
to understand that as well.

1304
00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:36.985
And that is why the messages
about the end of the tunnel,

1305
00:42:36.985 --> 00:42:40.526
the vaccine, what we still need
to do in order to deal with this

1306
00:42:40.526 --> 00:42:44.235
problem, because social distancing
will be with us for a considerable

1307
00:42:44.235 --> 00:42:46.818
period of time, all these messages
I think actually are well

1308
00:42:46.818 --> 00:42:48.735
understood by the majority
of the British people.

1309
00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:51.901
I trust them to do the right thing
and I know together...

1310
00:42:51.901 --> 00:42:54.068
You don’t trust them,
that’s a lie, I’m sorry,

1311
00:42:54.068 --> 00:42:57.193
you don’t trust them to do the right
thing otherwise you wouldn’t decide

1312
00:42:57.193 --> 00:43:00.360
who they can and cannot go
to the pub with, who they can

1313
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.443
and cannot have in their home,
whether they can be on their patio

1314
00:43:03.443 --> 00:43:05.568
or not, their patio,
which tear they are in.

1315
00:43:05.568 --> 00:43:07.735
It is absolute nonsense,
for this government to claim

1316
00:43:07.735 --> 00:43:09.443
you don’t want to be to dramatic...

1317
00:43:09.443 --> 00:43:11.568
Julia, we haven’t got the police
in everybody’s home...

1318
00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:12.818
You are policing people’s homes...

1319
00:43:12.818 --> 00:43:13.818
We have not.

1320
00:43:13.818 --> 00:43:15.526
Right now, we are
policing people’s homes.

1321
00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:18.401
You have sacked half of the police
over the last ten years.

1322
00:43:18.401 --> 00:43:20.526
Well, we are recruiting
thousands more as we speak.

1323
00:43:20.526 --> 00:43:23.901
You think if I had my family,
if I had people from outside my

1324
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.318
immediate family from my house
in my home tomorrow night

1325
00:43:26.318 --> 00:43:28.693
that I would still have
myjob the next day?

1326
00:43:28.693 --> 00:43:29.776
I doubt it.

1327
00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:32.610
Julia, if we took your approach,
then the NHS would be overwhelmed.

1328
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.651
No, it wouldn’t.

1329
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:35.568
One of the biggest factors
in the decision—making...

1330
00:43:35.568 --> 00:43:37.985
So you are saying you don’t
trust the British people.

1331
00:43:37.985 --> 00:43:39.193
Forgive me, I was involved...

1332
00:43:39.193 --> 00:43:42.568
When you say you do trust
the British people, but if we do not

1333
00:43:42.568 --> 00:43:45.193
have the rules telling people
who we can and can’t see

1334
00:43:45.193 --> 00:43:46.443
and where we can go...

1335
00:43:46.443 --> 00:43:47.443
Let him answer.

1336
00:43:47.443 --> 00:43:49.610
I was involved in the
decision—making and I saw

1337
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:50.610
the figures rising...

1338
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.651
You just contradicted yourself.

1339
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:53.568
Problems with the NHS,
capacity in our hospitals.

1340
00:43:53.568 --> 00:43:56.276
I certainly was not going
to preside as a minister over

1341
00:43:56.276 --> 00:43:57.901
a disaster in our NHS.

1342
00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:02.860
That was absolutely
out of the question,

1343
00:44:04.443 --> 00:44:06.151
we would have
failed the British people.

1344
00:44:06.151 --> 00:44:08.026
Throughout this, we have
protected our health service.

1345
00:44:08.026 --> 00:44:09.526
The NHS has been long protected.

1346
00:44:09.526 --> 00:44:12.610
And make sure that it has been able
to work throughout this crisis.

1347
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.526
OK, let’s take another
question from Janine Sawyer.

1348
00:44:14.526 --> 00:44:15.568
Good evening.

1349
00:44:15.568 --> 00:44:17.276
Footballers at Millwall
and Colchester were booed

1350
00:44:17.276 --> 00:44:20.151
for taking the knee in support
of Black Lives Matter on Saturday.

1351
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:21.818
A government minister,
when interviewed on Sunday,

1352
00:44:21.818 --> 00:44:23.276
did not unequivocally
condemn the fans.

1353
00:44:23.276 --> 00:44:26.193
Should more have been said by both
the politicians and the clubs

1354
00:44:26.193 --> 00:44:27.443
in support of the players?

1355
00:44:27.443 --> 00:44:30.318
Let’s be clear, you are referring
to George Eustice, are you, Janine,

1356
00:44:30.318 --> 00:44:31.485
in terms of government ministers?

1357
00:44:31.485 --> 00:44:34.193
Let’s just be clear exactly
what George Eustice did say, Robert.

1358
00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:36.818
I wonder if you want to clarify
what the position is.

1359
00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:39.651
I’m sorry, I did not catch fully
what George said about that.

1360
00:44:39.651 --> 00:44:42.235
George Eustice talked
about Black Lives Matter,

1361
00:44:42.235 --> 00:44:45.360
with capital letters,
he certainly talked about that,

1362
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.735
Janine, I think that is
what you are referring to.

1363
00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:49.568
Anand?

1364
00:44:49.568 --> 00:44:53.318
I think it was wrong
to boo the players.

1365
00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:55.693
Let me start on the other
side of the argument...

1366
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.151
Do you think they were
right to take the knee?

1367
00:44:58.151 --> 00:44:59.818
Yeah, I think players can do...

1368
00:44:59.818 --> 00:45:03.443
If that is how they want to show
their support for trying to get rid

1369
00:45:03.443 --> 00:45:04.443
of racism in sport...

1370
00:45:04.443 --> 00:45:07.360
Look, I get irritated
when I’m watching football

1371
00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.735
and the Black Lives Matter logo
comes across the top.

1372
00:45:09.735 --> 00:45:12.110
I don’t like being force fed
what I should think,

1373
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.568
even if I agree with it.

1374
00:45:13.568 --> 00:45:16.193
I don’t like being told
I have to wear a poppy.

1375
00:45:16.193 --> 00:45:18.860
I don’t like people telling me
what I should think, 0K?

1376
00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:19.901
It irritates me.

1377
00:45:19.901 --> 00:45:23.568
I also think that there’s a lot
of virtue signalling,

1378
00:45:23.568 --> 00:45:28.193
particularly by corporates,
you actually don’t do very much

1379
00:45:28.193 --> 00:45:32.985
for sort of inequality or prejudice
or that in their day—to—day

1380
00:45:32.985 --> 00:45:35.401
practices but stick a logo
on their site to make

1381
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:36.401
themselves feel better.

1382
00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:39.776
There are all sorts of problems
with this, but it was wrong to boo

1383
00:45:39.776 --> 00:45:40.818
for several reasons.

1384
00:45:40.818 --> 00:45:42.610
One, because it isjust rude.

1385
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.526
I think the players
who kneel are kneeling

1386
00:45:44.526 --> 00:45:46.693
because they want to make
a statement about racism.

1387
00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:48.610
I simply don’t believe
that the players believe

1388
00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.235
in a movement that wants
to undermine capitalism.

1389
00:45:51.235 --> 00:45:54.360
I think they are trying to show
respect and to make a stand

1390
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.318
against racism and I think booing
that is unpleasant.

1391
00:46:00.276 --> 00:46:04.110
And I think also that if a bit
of hectoring by the TV companies

1392
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.443
is a pretty small price to pay
for sport at long, long last doing

1393
00:46:07.443 --> 00:46:09.776
something about this.

1394
00:46:09.776 --> 00:46:12.901
I remember as a kid watching
football with my dad and you would

1395
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:13.943
hear the monkey noises.

1396
00:46:13.943 --> 00:46:17.443
And the commentators
would not say a word.

1397
00:46:17.443 --> 00:46:18.610
We were sitting there going,

1398
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:21.776
"Are you not going to say
what is going on on the telly?"

1399
00:46:21.776 --> 00:46:22.985
They would not say anything.

1400
00:46:22.985 --> 00:46:27.110
TV has a pretty sordid past when it
comes to racism in sport.

1401
00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.276
I think they are probably
overcompensating and over virtue

1402
00:46:29.276 --> 00:46:32.151
signalling now but I would far
rather that than where we came

1403
00:46:32.151 --> 00:46:35.485
from and it is a step in the right
direction though only a step.

1404
00:46:35.485 --> 00:46:36.901
Recognising racism
is the first step.

1405
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:39.443
Dealing with it, dealing
with prejudice of all kinds,

1406
00:46:39.443 --> 00:46:43.068
dealing with prejudice
against people of a different

1407
00:46:43.068 --> 00:46:45.276
colour, 3 different sexual
orientation, of a different class,

1408
00:46:45.276 --> 00:46:48.568
all of that exists in our
society and we need to go

1409
00:46:48.568 --> 00:46:50.610
beyond kneeling to acting.

1410
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:54.776
And Robert, just to be clear,
I thought you would be across this

1411
00:46:54.776 --> 00:46:59.818
but George Eustice was played
the clip on TV of what happened

1412
00:47:00.485 --> 00:47:03.360
at Millwall and he said he could not
hear it terribly well

1413
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.235
but he did say that if players
want to take the knee,

1414
00:47:06.235 --> 00:47:10.235
that should be are respected.

1415
00:47:10.235 --> 00:47:11.860
In terms of the question
from Janine,

1416
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.985
have football clubs,
have politicians done enough?

1417
00:47:13.985 --> 00:47:17.068
No, and I think Anand’s
point about endemic,

1418
00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:19.401
tolerated and accepted racism
in football and in other sport

1419
00:47:19.401 --> 00:47:24.360
is sadly well documented
and it is not over yet.

1420
00:47:32.568 --> 00:47:35.235
I think if people want to make that
sort of demonstration

1421
00:47:35.235 --> 00:47:37.151
and that gesture, then
they should be respected.

1422
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:40.693
But I think Anand is right as well
that it is no good just putting

1423
00:47:40.693 --> 00:47:42.943
slogans up and trying to convince
people that somehow

1424
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:45.151
that is going to be enough.

1425
00:47:45.151 --> 00:47:48.735
It is up to all of us
in our conduct, what we do, to not

1426
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:51.860
just talk about the characteristics
and the issues but to go beyond that

1427
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.485
and look at the people whose lives
are affected by this

1428
00:47:54.485 --> 00:47:56.193
because there will be
other circumstances that

1429
00:47:56.193 --> 00:47:58.568
will accompany a lot of this,
that creates the barriers

1430
00:47:58.568 --> 00:48:03.610
that have to be removed.

1431
00:48:03.943 --> 00:48:07.735
And therefore, absolutely,
booing of that is disrespectful,

1432
00:48:07.735 --> 00:48:10.401
it is rude and intimidatory
and unacceptable but at the same

1433
00:48:10.401 --> 00:48:13.735
time, we all need to be free
to make our own contribution and do

1434
00:48:13.735 --> 00:48:18.110
things in our own way
if we are really going to combat

1435
00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.235
and overcome some of the barriers
and prejudices that

1436
00:48:20.235 --> 00:48:21.443
still exist in society.

1437
00:48:21.443 --> 00:48:22.735
Mark?

1438
00:48:22.735 --> 00:48:26.318
Thank you, Fiona.

1439
00:48:26.318 --> 00:48:31.276
Yes, I was obviously
upset about the booing.

1440
00:48:33.901 --> 00:48:38.860
What I don’t understand is,
when they are going to start booing,

1441
00:48:39.943 --> 00:48:42.610
afterwards, they are going to start
cheering the same players that

1442
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.776
scored a goalfor them.

1443
00:48:43.776 --> 00:48:48.693
And coming back, I know you don’t
like coming back but I was a bit

1444
00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:50.568
discombobulated aboutJulia’s
comment about the small

1445
00:48:50.568 --> 00:48:54.235
Caribbean islands.

1446
00:48:54.235 --> 00:48:57.443
Ijust wanted to know
what she was on about then.

1447
00:48:57.443 --> 00:49:01.735
It was a comment regarding
whether you were America or China

1448
00:49:01.735 --> 00:49:04.110
or a small Caribbean island, ie,
a small nation state

1449
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:09.151
without much power.

1450
00:49:10.443 --> 00:49:11.443
Phil?

1451
00:49:11.443 --> 00:49:15.151
I was just going to add,
I think in terms of player support,

1452
00:49:15.151 --> 00:49:18.443
last night or the night before,
there was a game in Europe where two

1453
00:49:18.443 --> 00:49:21.151
teams walked off the field
in protest about a racist comment

1454
00:49:21.151 --> 00:49:24.443
made by one of the officials,
so I think it does go beyond just

1455
00:49:24.443 --> 00:49:25.485
taking the knee now.

1456
00:49:25.485 --> 00:49:30.360
Martin?

1457
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.443
Yeah, I mean, Istill remember
Martin Luther King and so this topic

1458
00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:35.568
started even before then,
as we know, and it

1459
00:49:35.568 --> 00:49:39.068
is still raging on.

1460
00:49:39.068 --> 00:49:41.860
Ijust don’t know how we get away
from this almost tribal

1461
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.860
view of other people,
especially when, the point that

1462
00:49:49.235 --> 00:49:52.401
Anand made about he does not
like to be told what to think

1463
00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:54.735
and I think a lot of
people feel like that,

1464
00:49:54.735 --> 00:49:56.318
whether it is right or wrong.

1465
00:49:56.318 --> 00:50:01.235
Steve 7

1466
00:50:01.235 --> 00:50:03.151
I am totally against
any form of racism.

1467
00:50:03.151 --> 00:50:04.568
I think it is just intolerable.

1468
00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:07.735
And it always has been.

1469
00:50:07.735 --> 00:50:12.693
But I do feel that taking
the knee might be becoming

1470
00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:17.901
past its sell by date,
shall we say, at football

1471
00:50:17.901 --> 00:50:22.943
matches, inasmuch as, yes,
everyone is doing it.

1472
00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:27.526
Look at F1, look at the grid before
each Grand Prix and they have

1473
00:50:27.526 --> 00:50:28.985
the Black Lives Matter moment there.

1474
00:50:28.985 --> 00:50:31.735
Half the drivers don’t kneel.

1475
00:50:31.735 --> 00:50:36.610
They stand and respect the moment.

1476
00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:41.235
I honestly think, if you look
at what is going on within football

1477
00:50:41.235 --> 00:50:44.901
and other sports with racism,
I think it has got to the stage now

1478
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:47.443
where the clubs have got
to be more accountable

1479
00:50:47.443 --> 00:50:52.443
for their fans’ behaviour.

1480
00:50:53.276 --> 00:50:57.151
I know, I have been to football
matches where you hear it

1481
00:50:57.151 --> 00:51:00.526
on the tannoy, and it says to you,
"If you hear a racist comment,

1482
00:51:00.526 --> 00:51:02.026
please report it to a steward."

1483
00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:04.693
You can sit at a London
derby and you can hear

1484
00:51:04.693 --> 00:51:05.735
racist protests aplenty.

1485
00:51:05.735 --> 00:51:09.985
You tell the steward
and they just walk away.

1486
00:51:09.985 --> 00:51:13.360
There has got to be a much harder,
firmer line on it than just,

1487
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.193
you know, sort of like taking
the knee or saying that we

1488
00:51:16.193 --> 00:51:18.110
won’t tolerate racism.

1489
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.360
We have got to actually
physically kick it out.

1490
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.693
Julia, let me take you back
to the original question,

1491
00:51:24.693 --> 00:51:26.610
talking about the footballers
at Millwall and Colchester

1492
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:28.360
who were booed for taking the knee.

1493
00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.360
Yeah.

1494
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.443
In support of Black Lives Matter.

1495
00:51:31.443 --> 00:51:34.485
Was enough done by politicians
and football teams?

1496
00:51:34.485 --> 00:51:36.901
What action should they do?

1497
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:40.568
If people are allowed
to make their gesture of taking

1498
00:51:40.568 --> 00:51:42.943
the knee, surely the fans
are allowed their gesture back?

1499
00:51:42.943 --> 00:51:44.693
I don’t actually approve of either.

1500
00:51:44.693 --> 00:51:49.360
Right, so hang on, are you saying
that it was fair enough

1501
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.360
that the fans were
booing the players?

1502
00:51:54.985 --> 00:51:56.276
It’s a free country.

1503
00:51:56.276 --> 00:51:57.693
The fans are allowed to boo.

1504
00:51:57.693 --> 00:51:59.860
It is not something
I would have done myself.

1505
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.276
That said, I don’t think
that the players should now

1506
00:52:02.276 --> 00:52:04.193
or should ever have been
taking the knee.

1507
00:52:04.193 --> 00:52:06.610
I think people were desperate
for football and sport generally

1508
00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:09.026
to come back after the lockdown
and desperate for some

1509
00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:11.443
escapism from the politics,
from the difficulty of daily life,

1510
00:52:11.443 --> 00:52:13.776
and they would like to have politics
separate from football

1511
00:52:13.776 --> 00:52:15.735
and they did not want it brought in.

1512
00:52:17.026 --> 00:52:20.193
Look, I think it is absurd
that we should even need to say,

1513
00:52:20.193 --> 00:52:22.776
of course, we don’t want racism,
of course, we abhor racism,

1514
00:52:22.776 --> 00:52:24.735
of course we don’t
want it in football...

1515
00:52:24.735 --> 00:52:27.610
So when black players feel
it is important to take the knee,

1516
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.526
you think they shouldn’t be
taking the knee?

1517
00:52:29.526 --> 00:52:30.568
I don’t...

1518
00:52:30.568 --> 00:52:32.735
We don’t allow political
demonstrations of any other kind,

1519
00:52:32.735 --> 00:52:36.110
other than the wearing of the poppy,
in football matches and we do that

1520
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.735
for a very good reason, and this
was a political demonstration.

1521
00:52:39.735 --> 00:52:42.485
The players originally,
when they started Premier League

1522
00:52:42.485 --> 00:52:45.110
matches, had Black Lives Matter
written on their shirts, the slogan

1523
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:49.193
of a now—political organisation.

1524
00:52:49.193 --> 00:52:52.943
Regardless of the Marxist defund
the police aims of the organisation,

1525
00:52:52.943 --> 00:52:56.110
I think it is quite bizarre
that the only demonstration that

1526
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:58.443
happens at the beginning
of our football matches should be

1527
00:52:58.443 --> 00:53:00.610
a demonstration in relation
to the horrific racist murder

1528
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.526
of a black man in America,
many months ago.

1529
00:53:03.526 --> 00:53:06.151
It is not something that
happened in this country. anyone

1530
00:53:06.151 --> 00:53:08.776
in this country would endorse

1531
00:53:08.776 --> 00:53:10.360
or ever say was acceptable.

1532
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.443
I find it strange that
that is the one thing.

1533
00:53:13.443 --> 00:53:16.151
I am looking forward to those same
footballers showing the same

1534
00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:18.526
principles when for instance
many of them will be playing

1535
00:53:18.526 --> 00:53:20.235
for England in the Qatar World Cup.

1536
00:53:20.235 --> 00:53:22.860
When they go to Qatar,
will they be taking a knee

1537
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.985
for all the women who have no real
legal rights and the violence

1538
00:53:25.985 --> 00:53:28.318
that goes against them?

1539
00:53:28.318 --> 00:53:30.901
Will they take a knee
for all of the gay people

1540
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:34.193
who are imprisoned or even executed
for being gay?

1541
00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:39.235
Why are we choosing this one
horrific, terrible act of injustice

1542
00:53:39.443 --> 00:53:44.443
and violence as the one issue
that we are expected

1543
00:53:46.026 --> 00:53:48.110
to have a political demonstration
of every aingle week?

1544
00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:50.776
I think we can all agree
it was a horrific murder,

1545
00:53:50.776 --> 00:53:53.443
we don’t want it to happen,
there needs to be more

1546
00:53:53.443 --> 00:53:56.068
to tackle police violence,
there needs to be more to tackle

1547
00:53:56.068 --> 00:53:58.943
racism in sport and in football
in particular but I don’t feel

1548
00:53:58.943 --> 00:54:02.068
the need, and I think a lot of fans
feel the same way,

1549
00:54:02.068 --> 00:54:04.193
to have a demonstration
and a gesture about it

1550
00:54:04.193 --> 00:54:05.276
every single match.

1551
00:54:05.276 --> 00:54:06.318
Wes 7

1552
00:54:06.318 --> 00:54:08.943
I will come to you in
a minute, Anand, but Wes.

1553
00:54:08.943 --> 00:54:13.985
Sometimes, things happen in history
that are so shocking and so brutal

1554
00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:18.360
that it forces a conversation
and opens up an opportunity to shift

1555
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.443
the dial in a positive
direction and change deep,

1556
00:54:22.443 --> 00:54:27.318
ingrained, endemic problems
which plague societies.

1557
00:54:27.318 --> 00:54:31.276
The murder of George Floyd on camera
in front of the eyes of notjust

1558
00:54:31.276 --> 00:54:34.485
America but the eyes of the world
opened up such a conversation.

1559
00:54:34.485 --> 00:54:38.860
Racism is not new in this country
or the United States of America.

1560
00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:42.276
And on a number of levels,
of course, racism in this

1561
00:54:42.276 --> 00:54:45.443
country is very different
than it was in the 19805 when I was

1562
00:54:45.443 --> 00:54:50.401
born, or the 19505 and 19605.

1563
00:54:52.401 --> 00:54:56.026
We don’t have signs up
any longer that say "No

1564
00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:57.318
blacks,
no dogs, no Irish.‘

1565
00:54:57.318 --> 00:54:59.943
But hate crime remains a problem
and is on the increase

1566
00:54:59.943 --> 00:55:00.985
in too many cases.

1567
00:55:00.985 --> 00:55:02.193
Indirect discrimination,
whether through education,

1568
00:55:02.193 --> 00:55:07.235
employment, criminaljustice,
that remains a problem, too.

1569
00:55:08.068 --> 00:55:09.943
When Millwall footballers
decided to take the knee,

1570
00:55:09.943 --> 00:55:12.443
nobody thinks that it was some kind
of Marxist protest.

1571
00:55:12.443 --> 00:55:16.818
No one thinks that it was about
defunding the police.

1572
00:55:16.818 --> 00:55:20.026
What it was about was saying,
"We are not going to be bystanders

1573
00:55:20.026 --> 00:55:22.860
to racism and we think this
conversation is important,

1574
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.443
and we, footballers,
with fans and a following,

1575
00:55:26.443 --> 00:55:29.068
are going to use our platform
to say something about it

1576
00:55:29.068 --> 00:55:31.026
and encourage you tojoin in".

1577
00:55:31.026 --> 00:55:35.026
Let’s not pretend that the booing
of those players was anything other

1578
00:55:35.026 --> 00:55:38.401
than a racist response
to an antiracist protest.

1579
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:41.360
And let’s also...

1580
00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.443
Can Ijust say, in fairness,
I have to say, whether you agree

1581
00:55:45.443 --> 00:55:48.151
with it or not that the Millwall
supporters club has said

1582
00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:52.526
that the booing was not
motivated by racism,

1583
00:55:52.526 --> 00:55:55.443
they were doing it in reaction
to the taking down of war

1584
00:55:55.443 --> 00:55:57.401
memorials and the defacing
of Winston Churchill statues.

1585
00:55:57.401 --> 00:55:59.985
Well, let’s not think for a moment
that before everybody booed,

1586
00:55:59.985 --> 00:56:02.860
they all looked at each other,
had a little chinwag and decided

1587
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.943
what the right response...

1588
00:56:03.943 --> 00:56:07.735
You know, let’s have this
kind of conversation

1589
00:56:07.735 --> 00:56:09.193
and then we will start booing.

1590
00:56:09.193 --> 00:56:13.860
Come on, let’s get real about this.

1591
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.360
More positively, at Liverpool,
at Anfield, then at Chelsea,

1592
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.985
Stamford Bridge, people
applauded their players

1593
00:56:17.985 --> 00:56:21.610
and stood with them,
and in terms ofJulia’s sort

1594
00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.735
of point, well, what are
people supposed to do

1595
00:56:23.735 --> 00:56:25.901
if they see or hear racism?

1596
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:30.693
I know that tackling racism
and challenging it, particularly

1597
00:56:30.693 --> 00:56:35.651
when it is from your own side
or within your own tribe

1598
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:40.693
or your own team or your own family,
can be difficult and uncomfortable,

1599
00:56:40.735 --> 00:56:43.818
but I bet you it is a hell
of a sight less uncomfortable

1600
00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:45.985
than being those players
on the pitch being booed

1601
00:56:45.985 --> 00:56:49.568
by their own fans or being the black
fans on the terrace having to listen

1602
00:56:49.568 --> 00:56:51.276
to those monkey chants or the banana

1603
00:56:51.276 --> 00:56:53.443
skins being thrown at players
and every other manifestation

1604
00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:56.776
of racism we see on the pitch,
off the pitch, out in the country

1605
00:56:56.776 --> 00:56:57.818
and in our communities.

1606
00:56:57.818 --> 00:57:02.818
The problem is notjust racism,
it is bystanders to racism

1607
00:57:03.235 --> 00:57:05.401
and I saulte the players
for using their platform

1608
00:57:05.401 --> 00:57:07.776
and their opportunity to send
a message to their fans

1609
00:57:07.776 --> 00:57:10.193
and supporters and I think most
people in this country

1610
00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:12.110
are anti—racists and
would be with them, too.

1611
00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:13.443
Malcolm Turnbull?

1612
00:57:13.443 --> 00:57:15.901
Thank you, I think Wes
summed it up very well,

1613
00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:20.860
you’ve got to have zero
tolerance for racism.

1614
00:57:22.318 --> 00:57:24.985
In a multicultural society
above all, as Britain

1615
00:57:24.985 --> 00:57:28.110
is and Australia is,
you have got to treat people

1616
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.526
with respect, mutual
respect is the glue that

1617
00:57:30.526 --> 00:57:35.526
binds our diverse society together.

1618
00:57:38.776 --> 00:57:40.693
Taking a knee is a perfectly
respectful statement.

1619
00:57:40.693 --> 00:57:42.110
It is a statement about racism.

1620
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:46.735
It is a statement against racism.

1621
00:57:46.735 --> 00:57:51.276
Booing people, in any context,
is abuse, let’s be frank, and so,

1622
00:57:51.276 --> 00:57:56.276
we have had experience
here in Australia with fans,

1623
00:57:58.193 --> 00:58:03.110
some fans, booing aboriginal
players, one in particular,

1624
00:58:03.318 --> 00:58:06.151
Adam Goods, who is a real champion
for First Nations peoples here,

1625
00:58:06.151 --> 00:58:08.068
and first Australians.

1626
00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:11.235
Look, I think you have just got
to have zero tolerance for racism.

1627
00:58:11.235 --> 00:58:13.610
I honestly can’t improve
on what Wes said, I think

1628
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.193
he summed it up very well.

1629
00:58:16.193 --> 00:58:19.276
Anand, we’ve not got much time
but you want to come on that.

1630
00:58:19.276 --> 00:58:22.651
I agree with Wes that the killing
of George Floyd was a seismic moment

1631
00:58:22.651 --> 00:58:25.485
that led to a debate that was long
overdue that we had.

1632
00:58:25.485 --> 00:58:28.193
I mean, I shareJulia’s reservations
to an extent about it

1633
00:58:28.193 --> 00:58:29.235
being Black Lives Matter.

1634
00:58:29.235 --> 00:58:30.901
I don’t understand,
to be honest, why

1635
00:58:30.901 --> 00:58:32.193
it isn’t Kick It Out.

1636
00:58:32.193 --> 00:58:36.110
But the fundamental issue for me is,
you have these incredibly powerful

1637
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:38.860
and influential role models,
these footballers, who are revered

1638
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.526
on, you know, as role
models, basically saying

1639
00:58:42.526 --> 00:58:46.193
at the start of every game,
"Racism is wrong, don’t do it."

1640
00:58:46.193 --> 00:58:48.860
And however imperfect it may be,
and whatever sort of connotations

1641
00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:51.526
there might be hanging around
the edges, that statement

1642
00:58:51.526 --> 00:58:56.276
in and of itself should be welcomed.

1643
00:58:56.276 --> 00:58:58.068
The hour is up.
No way!

1644
00:58:58.068 --> 00:58:59.735
We are going to end it here.

1645
00:58:59.735 --> 00:59:04.735
Some of you still have your hands up
but we’re out of time, I’m afraid.

1646
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.776
Tonight, our lovely audience
came from Chelmsford,

1647
00:59:08.776 --> 00:59:10.943
thank you forjoining us,
our last audience before

1648
00:59:10.943 --> 00:59:14.068
Christmas and I want to say,
don’t forget, wherever you live,

1649
00:59:14.068 --> 00:59:17.943
do apply if you would like to join
the QT 50, our new UK wide audience,

1650
00:59:17.943 --> 00:59:20.693
and that will start in the New Year.

1651
00:59:20.693 --> 00:59:23.318
You can do that by going
to the Question Time website

1652
00:59:23.318 --> 00:59:25.985
and following the instructions
and who knows, I might be seeing

1653
00:59:25.985 --> 00:59:28.360
you virtually on our big
screen in the New Year.

1654
00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:32.026
I would love that to be the case.

1655
00:59:32.026 --> 00:59:35.526
Adrian Chiles is coming up
on Question Time Extra Time

1656
00:59:35.526 --> 00:59:35.943
Adrian Chiles is coming up
on Question Time Extra Time

1657
00:59:35.943 --> 00:59:39.526
with his guests and you can see
on the screen how to get in touch,

1658
00:59:39.526 --> 00:59:42.401
by phone, text or tweet and you can
have your say there.

1659
00:59:42.401 --> 00:59:45.068
For now, I just want to say,
before Christmas, for us,

1660
00:59:45.068 --> 00:59:47.443
thank you very much to the panel
for coming tonight.

1661
00:59:47.443 --> 00:59:50.318
Malcolm, thank you for getting
up early in Australia.

1662
00:59:50.318 --> 00:59:54.110
I should say that Malcolm earlier
shared his view of the bay

1663
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:57.026
which was pretty gutting
for all of us because it has been

1664
00:59:57.026 --> 01:00:00.610
such a grey day in the UK but thank
you very much forjoining us.

1665
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.526
And of course, the audience
in Chelmsford, thank

1666
01:00:02.526 --> 01:00:05.401
you as well and thank
you to you at home for watching.

1667
01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:06.526
Goodbye.

1668
01:00:35.943 --> 01:00:38.235
Who’s your 2020 hero?

1669
01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:41.026
The incredible people
that made anything possible.

1670
01:00:41.026 --> 01:00:44.610
# We created something phenomenal,
don’t you agree? #

1671
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.568
This is the power of sport.

1672
01:00:46.568 --> 01:00:48.860
They’ve come out
with their heads held high.

1673
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.110
Here is an unforgettable moment.

1674
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.151
This is the best of everyone.

1675
01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:56.401
It’s a year to remember
for so many reasons.

1676
01:00:56.401 --> 01:00:58.901
# I know you got my back
and you know I got you

1677
01:00:58.901 --> 01:01:00.110
# So come on... #

1678
01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:01.818
A star—studded line—up

1679
01:01:01.818 --> 01:01:03.443
of contender champions. Take a bow!

1680
01:01:03.443 --> 01:01:05.068
And your chance
to vote on the night.

1681
01:01:05.068 --> 01:01:06.360
# Let’s get physical! #

1682
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.526
BBC Sports Personality of the year.

1683
01:01:08.526 --> 01:01:09.985
Who wins it is all up to you.

1684
01:01:16.026 --> 01:01:18.818
Who’s ready for some musica?!

1685
01:01:18.818 --> 01:01:21.443
MUSIC: Dynamite
by BTS

1686
01:01:25.776 --> 01:01:27.860
THEY SCREAM

1687
01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:30.526
Aaaargh!

1688
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.651
THEY GASP

1689
01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:33.693
0h, hey, guys.

1690
01:01:33.693 --> 01:01:35.651
THEY SCREAM

1691
01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:37.485
What is going on?

1692
01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.985
Tonight is about family.

1693
01:01:38.985 --> 01:01:42.235
There’s no greater gift than love.

1694
01:01:42.235 --> 01:01:43.776
I didn’t want you to be lonely.

1695
01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.776
Films for all the family.

1696
01:01:47.776 --> 01:01:48.818
HE LAUGHS

1697
01:01:48.818 --> 01:01:50.110
Champion!

1698
01:02:15.818 --> 01:02:22.235
Chris, get your phone out and look
at your calendar. 0K, got it. Sunday

1699
01:02:22.235 --> 01:02:22.818
at your alandar. 0K, got it. Sunday
the 13th of

1700
01:02:22.818 --> 01:02:23.443
at your calendar. 0K, got it. Sunday
the 13th of December, that’s one

1701
01:02:23.443 --> 01:02:25.485
the 13th of December, that’s one
they will decide what to do, pull

1702
01:02:25.485 --> 01:02:27.443
they will decide what to do, pull
the plug on the negotiations or

1703
01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:29.068
the plug on the negotiations or
tarry on.

1704
01:02:29.068 --> 01:02:30.276
the plug on the negotiations or
carry on. This Sunday? I think

1705
01:02:30.276 --> 01:02:31.526
carry on. This Sunday? I think
Parliament’s Christmas holiday is

1706
01:02:31.526 --> 01:02:31.818
Partiament’s Christmas holiday is
meant

1707
01:02:31.818 --> 01:02:34.485
Parliament’s Christmas holiday is
meant to start on the 17th. They are

1708
01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:35.860
meant to start on the 17th. They are
but there is an acceptance that

1709
01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.401
but there is an acceptance that
maybe it could be extended a bit if

1710
01:02:39.401 --> 01:02:40.693
maybe it could be extended a bit if
these Brexit talks rumble on beyond

1711
01:02:40.693 --> 01:02:42.818
these Brexit talks rumble on beyond
Sunday and so will the timing knocks

1712
01:02:42.818 --> 01:02:44.443
Sunday and so will the timing knocks
things on. But according to my

1713
01:02:44.443 --> 01:02:47.401
things on. But according to my
calendar, you are going to hit

1714
01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:50.068
calendar, you are going to hit
Christmas pretty quickly. Yes, which

1715
01:02:50.068 --> 01:02:52.318
Christmas pretty quickly. Yes, which
makes me wonder, the week of New

1716
01:02:52.318 --> 01:02:54.318
makes me wonder, the week of New
Year’s Eve, which is on a Thursday,

1717
01:02:54.318 --> 01:02:56.401
Year’s Eve, which is on a Thursday,
there is going to be a vote in

1718
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:57.401
there is going to be a vote in
partiament

1719
01:02:57.401 --> 01:02:59.401
there is going to be a vote in
parliament on an EU trade deal on

1720
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.193
partiament on an EU trade deal on
New

1721
01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.151
parliament on an EU trade deal on
New Year’s Eve Eve? There are some

1722
01:03:02.151 --> 01:03:03.776
New Year’s Eve Eve? There are some
working days, technically, not for

1723
01:03:03.776 --> 01:03:04.901
working days, technically, not for
Parliament normally but I am just

1724
01:03:04.901 --> 01:03:06.110
Partiament normally but I am just
beginning to

1725
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.776
Parliament normally but I am just
beginning to think, given that every

1726
01:03:07.776 --> 01:03:09.568
beginning to think, given that every
iteration of this Brexit process is

1727
01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:11.360
iteration of this Brexit process is
usually involved if time is

1728
01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.526
usually involved if time is
available, time is used, that maybe,

1729
01:03:13.526 --> 01:03:16.401
available, time is used, that maybe,
just maybe, that is what is going to

1730
01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:17.943
just maybe, that is what is going to
happen. Are you going to tell

understood the full extent of this.

1744
01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:47.610
We are particularly reliant
on the Dover—Calais crossing.

1745
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.526
KEIR STARMER: This election
blew away the argument

1746
01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:50.568
for a second referendum.

1747

Brussels between Ursula von der

1769
01:04:41.318 --> 01:04:41.651
Brussels between Ursula von der
Leyen and BorisJohnson, things

1770
01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:44.401
Leyen and Borisjohnson, things
seemed pretty tense last night ——

1771
01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:44.776
seemed pretty tense last night --
and after

1772
01:04:44.776 --> 01:04:46.193
seemed pretty tense last night ——
and after that but they seem more

1773
01:04:46.193 --> 01:04:47.026
and after that but they seem more
tense now because Boris

1774
01:04:47.026 --> 01:04:47.485
and after that but they seem more
tense now because BorisJohnson just

1775
01:04:47.485 --> 01:04:48.235
tense now because Boris johnson just
did a dip

1776
01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:48.443
tense now because Boris johnson just
did a clip for

1777
01:04:48.443 --> 01:04:48.860
tense now because BorisJohnson just
did a clip for the TV

1778
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:49.193
tense now because BorisJohnsonjust
did a clip for the TV cameras, where

1779
01:04:49.193 --> 01:04:53.610
did a clip for the TV cameras, where
he said he this. We need to be very,

1780
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:54.068
he said he this. We need to be very,
very dear,

1781
01:04:54.068 --> 01:04:56.026
he said he this. We need to be very,
very clear, there is a strong

1782
01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:56.818
very clear, there is a strong
possibility, a strong possibility,

1783
01:04:56.818 --> 01:04:58.818
possibility, a strong possibility,
that we will have a solution that is

1784
01:04:58.818 --> 01:05:00.735
that we will have a solution that is
much more like an Australian

1785
01:05:00.735 --> 01:05:02.860
much more like an Australian
relationship with the EU than a

1786
01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.443
relationship with the EU than a
Canadian relationship with the EU.

1787
01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:06.235
Canadian relationship with the EU.
That doesn’t mean it is a bad thing.

1788
01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:08.443
That doesn’t mean it is a bad thing.
There are plenty of ways, as I have

1789
01:05:08.443 --> 01:05:09.568
There are planty of ways, as I have
said, that

1790
01:05:09.568 --> 01:05:11.943
There are plenty of ways, as I have
said, that we can turn that to the

1791
01:05:11.943 --> 01:05:12.318
said, that we ran turn that to the
advantage of

1792
01:05:12.318 --> 01:05:14.485
said, that we can turn that to the
advantage of both sides in the

1793
01:05:14.485 --> 01:05:15.693
advantage of both sides in the
conversation. There are plenty of

1794
01:05:15.693 --> 01:05:18.985
conversation. There are plenty of
opportunities for the UK but, yes,

1795
01:05:18.985 --> 01:05:21.568
opportunities for the UK but, yes,
now is time for the public
