Saturday, a bit of drizzly weather

Temperature struggling up to around

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:20.205
12-13 in like winds. To the second
half of the

15
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.080

half of the weekend, a lot of cloud

16
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.747
half of the weekend, a lot of cloud
but this time I think the cloud

17
00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.705
but this time I think the cloud
should be a bit thinner so a better

18
00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:26.747
should be a bit thinner so a better
chance of seeing some sunshine

19
00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:28.205
chance of seeing some sunshine
perhaps although having said that

20
00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:29.122
perhaps although having said that
for Scotland and north—east England

21
00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.038
for Scotland and north-east England
it’s going to be

22
00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:30.872
for Scotland and north—east England
it’s going to be cold on Sunday. May

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:34.288
it’s going to be cold on Sunday. May
be signs of a bit of rain arriving

00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:35.038
be signs of a bit of rain arriving

in Northern Ireland, north—west
Scotland later in the day, that’s a

26
00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:38.788
Scotland later in the day, that’s a
sign of things to come. Instead of

27
00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.247
sign of things to come. Instead of
high pressure that we’ve got over

28
00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:42.455
high pressure that we’ve got over
the weekend, its low pressure

29
00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:43.747
the weekend, its low pressure
dominate early next week. Next week.

30
00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:44.205
dominate earty next week. Next week.
A rather

31
00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:45.497
dominate early next week. Next week.
A rather complicated and messy

32
00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:47.080
A rather complicated and messy
tangle of weather fronts. I can

33
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.038
tangla of weather fronts. I ran
simplify

34
00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:48.955
tangle of weather fronts. I can
simplify that for you. Early next

35
00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:49.247
simplify that for you. Earty next
week

36
00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:50.288
simplify that for you. Early next
week the weather is changing and

37
00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:55.747
I don’t want to even want to speak.
This music’s way too smooth.

38
00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:58.663
But how can sound waves physically
make you move?

39
00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:02.747
And in return, you get experiences
you like. It lifts you high.

40
00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:07.122
ASTRONAUT: Earth’s starting
to look pretty small now.

41
00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:08.997
Be moved by...

SCREECHING CRY

44
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:16.788
You want to change the world?

45
00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:18.913
Come with me and we will change
them all.

46
00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:20.788
Hold tight!

47
00:01:22.163 --> 00:01:24.163
Lyra. Lyra!

48
00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:25.663
Lyra!

49
00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.163
Victory!

50
00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:32.705
SHE SCREAMS

51
00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:42.455
You keep using that word — lie.

52
00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:44.955
It’s not the lie, it’s the cover—up.

53
00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:46.497
You know the Prime Minister.

54
00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:47.872
Yeah, I do — petty.

55
00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:52.622
I mean no disrespect, but the time
has come for a totally new approach.

56
00:01:52.622 --> 00:01:55.080
Are there any other scandals
we need to know about, Peter?

57
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.413
It’s somebody that says

58
00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:57.622
she’s your daughter.

59
00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:59.788
The briefing you asked for
on Peter Laurence —

60
00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:01.455
MI5 put it together.

61
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.705
Do I have any value to you
except as a liar?

62
00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:05.872
I’m going to nail Peter Laurence
once and for all.

63
00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:08.830
I have always been a mle breaker.
It’s my USP.

64
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.247
Every politician
expects to be Prime Minister.

65
00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:12.955
So you’re saying you’re clean?

66
00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:14.038
Squeaky.

67
00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:22.913
What makes World Service so unique

68
00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:24.913
is its genuine world perspective,

69
00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:27.205
notjust in news but actual
cultural landscape.

70
00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:29.955
Well, I grew up with the
World Service

71
00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:31.705
as the soundtrack to my life.

72
00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.330
We were never really cut off so long
as you had the BBC.

73
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.122
That’s where we heard the real news,

74
00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:39.955
a window to what’s going on in the
outside world.

75
00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:43.288
I can be out in the garden raking
leaves, doing mindless labour,

76
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.163
and yet feel as if I’m being put in
touch with the world.

77
00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:47.788
The whole world.

78

question tonight, which is Diane
Craig... Thank you, Fiona.

118
00:05:07.038 --> 00:05:09.455
Do you think that this pandemic
has been managed better

119
00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:11.830
by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland
than it has by Boris

120
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.830
Johnson in England

121
00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:25.247
ﬂ

122
00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:28.413
I think it is certainly not a
competition. It is about managing

123
00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:30.830
competition. It is about managing
how to balance that with managing

124
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.830
how to balance that with managing
the other harms, whether social,

125
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.122
the other harms, whether social,
health or economic. With the polling

126
00:05:34.122 --> 00:05:34.413
health or economic. with the polling
this

127
00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:35.830
health or economic. With the polling
this week we have seen three

128
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.663
this week we have seen three
quarters of people in Scotland are

129
00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:40.122
quarters of people in Scotland are
satisfied and how Nicola Sturgeon

130
00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:41.788
satisfied and how Nicola Sturgeon
has handled the pandemic is do you

131
00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:43.372
has handled the pandemic is do you
think she has handled it better than

132
00:05:43.372 --> 00:05:43.497
think she has handled it better than
Boris

133
00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:44.705
think she has handled it better than
BorisJohnson? I think she has

134
00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.247
BorisJohnson? I think she has
handled it in a remarkable way. I

135
00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:46.788
handled it in a remarkabla way. I
think it is

136
00:05:46.788 --> 00:05:47.830
handled it in a remarkable way. I
think it is one of the most

137
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.788
think it is one of the most
challenging situations for any

138
00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:50.622
challenging situations for any
leader to bn and at the beginning

139
00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:52.205
leader to bn and at the beginning
she said we would make mistakes and

140
00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:54.747
she said we would make mistakes and
she has been upfront throughout,

141
00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:57.788
she has been upfront throughout,
with honesty and integrity, that

142
00:05:57.788 --> 00:05:59.747
with honesty and integrity, that
things have been challenging.

143
00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:00.997
things have been challenging.
Scotland has a higher infection

144
00:06:00.997 --> 00:06:03.288
Scotland has a higher infection
growth rate than in England and the

145
00:06:03.288 --> 00:06:04.913
growth rate than in England and the
UK as a whole. Sire might but we

146
00:06:04.913 --> 00:06:05.205
UK as a whola. Sire might but we
also have

147
00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:06.163
UK as a whole. Sire might but we
also have the lowest rates per

148
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:07.497
also have the lowest rates per
hundred thousand than anywhere in

149
00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:09.455
hundred thousand than anywhere in
the UK and those are the figures

150
00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:10.663
the UK and those are the figures
that matter. We know because we

151
00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:12.788
that matter. We know because we
suppressed it so low during the

152
00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:13.913
suppressed it so low during the
summer and schools and universities

153
00:06:13.913 --> 00:06:16.122
summer and schools and universities
went back earlier, we are seeing the

154
00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:17.038
went back eartier, we are seeing the
figures increase,

155
00:06:17.038 --> 00:06:19.372
went back earlier, we are seeing the
figures increase, which is why early

156
00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:20.122
figures increase, which is why earty
action is key to

157
00:06:20.122 --> 00:06:22.080
figures increase, which is why early
action is key to avoiding a complete

158
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.288
action is key to avoiding a complete
lockdown, and I think Nicola

159
00:06:24.288 --> 00:06:25.413
lockdown, and I think Nicola
Sturgeon has done that. Certainly

160
00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:27.788
Sturgeon has done that. Certainly
this week’s figures in terms of

161
00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.205
this week’s figures in terms of
dissatisfaction with the Prime

162
00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:30.413
dissatisfaction with the Prime
Minister, in Scotland it is very

163
00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:31.663
Minister, in Scotland it is very
high.

164
00:06:31.663 --> 00:06:34.288
It’s almost the inverse —
76% are dissatisfied with the way

165
00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:36.705
the Prime Minister’s handled it —
but from my perspective

166
00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:39.080
the challenge for every
Government, notjust in the UK

167
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.205
but across the world,
is to suppress the virus,

168
00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:44.622
to keep the trust of the people,
and to ensure that we manage these

169
00:06:44.622 --> 00:06:47.205
other harms in terms of the economy
or society more widely.

170
00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:48.788
Well, Diane’s question
is very pointed.

171
00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:53.788
Who is managing it better,
Nicola Sturgeon or BorisJohnson?

172
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.163
Douglas Ross?

173
00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:57.580
I don’t think anyone can treat
this as a competition...

174
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.788
But that is the question.

175
00:06:58.788 --> 00:07:00.455
..when people continue
to lose their lives,

176
00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:02.830
when people continue to be infected
at an alarming rate.

177
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.455
But I think we do have
to look across the UK.

178
00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:07.872
There has been similar approach
taken by all four governments,

179
00:07:07.872 --> 00:07:10.038
and indeed around the world
we are still learning

180
00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:11.080
about this virus.

181
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.663
A virus that didn’t even exist
this time last year.

182
00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:15.788
There have the mistakes,
and big mistakes, in Scotland,

183
00:07:15.788 --> 00:07:18.455
and we’ve got to accept that
and listen to the advice

184
00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:21.080
we’re hearing when these mistakes
are made, and learn from them,

185
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.080
because in Scotland we had people
testing positive for Covid—19

186
00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:29.122
in a hospital being
discharged into a care home.

187
00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:31.497
We can’t allow that to happen.

188
00:07:31.497 --> 00:07:36.497
We’ve got to learn from that.

189
00:07:52.413 --> 00:07:55.788
And Nicola Sturgeon told us we would
learn from this and there would be

190
00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:56.788
a report in September.

191
00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:58.747
We are still waiting
in October for that.

192
00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:01.622
We have the highest percentage
of deaths in the care home setting

193
00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:03.330
anywhere in the UK here in Scotland.

194
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.955
So no one can claim a success.

195
00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:08.330
It is a battle that we are all still
fighting, it is one that

196
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.497
continues to take lives,
it is one we are still trying to get

197
00:08:11.497 --> 00:08:13.830
on top of, and that’s
just the health battle —

198
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.497
we’ve also got the economic hotspots
to deal with as well.

199
00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:18.663
And are you satisfied
with the way BorisJohnson

200
00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:19.705
is handling the pandemic?

201
00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:21.622
There have been mistakes
by the UK Government,

202
00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:23.788
by the Scottish Government,
by governments around the world.

203
00:08:23.788 --> 00:08:25.955
There have been errors made,
and at some time...

204
00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:28.580
So what do you think the UK
Government has done wrong?

205
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.622
At something we will look back
and say, "This should have been done

206
00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:35.830
differently", but I don’t think
anyone objectively can look

207
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.288
at what has happened in Scotland

208
00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:39.247
and see what has been
the big difference.

209
00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:40.955
What has the Scottish
Government done differently

210
00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.330
from the rest of the UK?

211
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.788
There are areas where I think
the Scottish Government have

212
00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:46.913
to learn, for example testing
positive people for Covid—19

213
00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:49.288
in hospital and then putting
them into a care home.

214
00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:51.455
That was the worst thing that
could have happened.

215
00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:53.622
Humzah, in ouraudience,
you’ve got your hand up.

216
00:08:53.622 --> 00:08:55.038
Hi.
So with regards to mistakes

217
00:08:55.038 --> 00:08:57.038
and Nicole Sturgeon,
what is the concrete evidence

218
00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:59.830
that the First Minister has used
in justifying her decision to crush

219
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.788
the hospitality sector and saying
that the recent spike in cases have

220
00:09:02.788 --> 00:09:04.413
come directly from pubs,
bars and restaurants?

221
00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:06.372
OK.
I will let you come back in.

222
00:09:06.372 --> 00:09:09.205
I’m just going to deal with the main
question here from Diane,

223
00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:11.413
which is "Has this pandemic been
managed better by

224
00:09:11.413 --> 00:09:14.247
Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it
has by BorisJohnson in England?"

225
00:09:14.247 --> 00:09:15.455
And neither of you say...

226
00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:18.080
Neither want to say,
and you’re both at pains to point

227
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.788
out it’s not a competition,
because it does matter to people

228
00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:23.122
who has handled it well
because lives are at stake.

229
00:09:23.122 --> 00:09:25.288
Mark, do you feel that either
government is listening

230
00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:27.705
to you, to the advice
you are giving at Sage?

231
00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:29.830
I’ve got no doubt that
the governments are listening,

232
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.497
and I’ve also got no doubt that
everyone’s trying as hard

233
00:09:32.497 --> 00:09:33.580
as they possibly can.

234
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.747
Yes, I’ve got no doubt
that they are listening

235
00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:37.830
to the advice, the scientific
advice, they are getting,

236
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.747
but frankly I think the wrong
question is being asked because it’s

237
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.872
not internal comparisons,
it is actually looking at other

238
00:09:42.872 --> 00:09:44.080
countries that are doing well.

239
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.330
50 South Korea, Vietnam, Germany.

240
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.163
I think what we have to do
is learn from what’s working

241
00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:50.788
well in other countries,
and frankly I think it would be

242
00:09:50.788 --> 00:09:53.497
easier if there was a bit more
commonality in the approach

243
00:09:53.497 --> 00:09:55.413
across all of the nations of the UK.

244
00:09:55.413 --> 00:09:58.497
And also we saw the advice
that was released by Sage this week,

245
00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:00.413
the advice that was given
to the governments

246
00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:01.663
on the 21st of September.

247
00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:03.997
From what we can see,
neither the Scottish Government nor

248
00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:07.122
the UK Government are following much
of the advice that Sage was giving?

249
00:10:07.122 --> 00:10:10.247
Well, they are following some of it,
but the bottom line of course

250
00:10:10.247 --> 00:10:12.872
is that Sage is looking purely
through the lens of controlling

251
00:10:12.872 --> 00:10:15.580
the pandemic, and they’re also
having to balance the very difficult

252
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.747
tightrope of the miserable health
consequences for other people

253
00:10:17.747 --> 00:10:20.080
as well, which is the effects
of the economic damage,

254
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.622
the unemployment,
the damage to education.

255
00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:24.872
But I think what we have to do
is we need a really clear

256
00:10:24.872 --> 00:10:26.788
strategy, and I think that’s
been less visible.

257
00:10:26.788 --> 00:10:29.247
What we have to do,
frankly, is learn to live

258
00:10:29.247 --> 00:10:31.663
with the virus whilst working
on the therapeutics and vaccines.

259
00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:34.747
And we’ve got to get it under
control, but keep it under control

260
00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:36.455
with much better public
health logistic delivery.

261
00:10:36.455 --> 00:10:37.913
Lucas, you’ve got your hand up.

262
00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:40.747
Yeah, so none of the panellists have
actually been able to answer,

263
00:10:40.747 --> 00:10:43.163
really, who has performed better,
Nicola Sturgeon or Borisjohnson,

264
00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:47.330
and of course it’s a horrendously
difficult period for both of them,

265
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.955
but why, and can they explain
the disparity between public opinion

266
00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:53.413
in how they’ve handled it?

267
00:10:53.413 --> 00:10:55.080
Clearly, people believe
that Nicola Sturgeon has

268
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.122
performed so much better.

269
00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:58.455
Grant, you’ve got your hand up.

270
00:10:58.455 --> 00:11:01.372
Yeah, I just wanted to follow
on from what Douglas was saying,

271
00:11:01.372 --> 00:11:06.163
and exactly what Lucas was saying.

272
00:11:06.163 --> 00:11:08.705
If both Holyrood and Westminster
have both made mistakes,

273
00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:11.288
is there a lesson to be learned
for the UK Government

274
00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:13.455
in the way that the public
are receiving Holyrood

275
00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:17.247
and Nicole Sturgeon so favourably?

276
00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:19.163
Seema Malhotra,
who do you think has performed

277
00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:22.038
better out of the two?

278
00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:26.580
I think we are in a decisive moment
in our efforts to tackle

279
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.247
the coronavirus, and the numbers
are clearly moving in the wrong

280
00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:32.038
direction, and that’s
across Scotland as well as England,

281
00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:34.955
and my worry is that neither
government is learning

282
00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:38.247
from the mistakes that were made
very earty on.

283
00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:41.413
The UK Government, it seems to me,
has lost control of the virus.

284
00:11:41.413 --> 00:11:46.413
They are losing confidence,
and there are no longer

285
00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:49.122
They are losing confidence,
and they are no longer

286
00:11:49.122 --> 00:11:50.205
following scientific advice.

287
00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:52.622
We’ve also not seen Nicola Sturgeon
come forward to follow

288
00:11:52.622 --> 00:11:54.788
the scientific advice that came
through in the way

289
00:11:54.788 --> 00:11:59.788
that it did from Sage.

290
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.247
And, under the SNP Government,
you’ve already mentioned that we’ve

291
00:12:03.247 --> 00:12:05.163
got the highest R rate in the UK.

292
00:12:05.163 --> 00:12:07.997
Both governments were far too
slow in setting up test,

293
00:12:07.997 --> 00:12:10.913
track and isolate, or Test
and Protect, and my worry is that

294
00:12:10.913 --> 00:12:14.247
with those businesses
and livelihoods at stake now,

295
00:12:14.247 --> 00:12:17.580
if we don’t have a way in which both
governments are going to learn

296
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.747
from what’s gone wrong and be honest
and open about it and work

297
00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:22.788
together more closely,
we’re going to see us

298
00:12:22.788 --> 00:12:25.413
going into a winter where it’s
going to be much more

299
00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:28.497
difficult for all of us.

300
00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:33.455
That’s why Labour has called
this week, as you know,

301
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.747
for a 2—3 week circuit break,
in line with Sage advice.

302
00:12:39.747 --> 00:12:41.163
And what does that mean, Seema?

303
00:12:41.163 --> 00:12:43.580
Sorry to interrupt, but what does
that mean, circuit break?

304
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.788
How would you define that?

305
00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:48.080
It is in what Sage has also said,
that it would be more along

306
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.247
the lines of where we were in May
with people staying at home,

307
00:12:51.247 --> 00:12:54.080
but there can be variations on that
because we are further forward.

308
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.997
And what’s been very
clearfrom Keir Starmer,

309
00:12:55.997 --> 00:12:58.705
and from the Labour Party,
is that we need to keep

310
00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:01.080
schools open, and I think
that is fairly universally felt,

311
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.038
that we should do what we can
to keep schools open,

312
00:13:07.538 --> 00:13:11.122
but if we are to have a circuit
break and that means to setback

313
00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:14.705
the virus by maybe 28 days,
it’s estimated, the estimate also

314
00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:17.788
being that we could save 8,000 lives
because we get it under control

315
00:13:17.788 --> 00:13:20.705
prior to Christmas and we protect
the NHS in doing that.

316
00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:23.038
Surely that’s got to be
advise that we listen to,

317
00:13:23.038 --> 00:13:25.247
because if we delay,
as the Government has repeatedly,

318
00:13:25.247 --> 00:13:27.497
then the consequences
will be far greater,

319
00:13:27.497 --> 00:13:29.663
both in terms of impact
on jobs and livelihoods,

320
00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:32.247
but also on the nation’s health
and the number of deaths.

321
00:13:32.247 --> 00:13:34.705
And do you support what the Mayor
of Greater Manchester,

322
00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:36.038
Andy Burnham, is saying?

323
00:13:36.038 --> 00:13:38.913
A Labour man, obviously,
in terms of he doesn’t want to see

324
00:13:38.913 --> 00:13:43.288
further lockdown in his area,
despite what you’re saying?

325
00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:46.872
Well, I’ve been in touch with Andy,
and I think one of the critical

326
00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:50.663
things has been that it hasn’t felt
that the evidence on which those

327
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:54.038
decisions are being made and the way
in which local leaders are involved

328
00:13:54.038 --> 00:13:58.997
has been anywhere near what we need
to see, and Ijust don’t understand

329
00:14:03.247 --> 00:14:06.580
why we have both a UK Government
that is over many years seen cuts

330
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.747
to local Government,
that has made local government less

331
00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:10.663
resilient, and also
the Scottish Government has cut

332
00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:12.788
funding to local government
in Scotland by much more

333
00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:15.205
than has been cut in terms
of budgets from Westminster.

334
00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:17.872
You know, this lack of resilience
has made it increasingly difficult,

335
00:14:17.872 --> 00:14:20.747
but what we’ve seen is that local
authorities, when they have been

336
00:14:20.747 --> 00:14:23.830
able to go about track and trace,
have actually been doing far better

337
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.788
than Serco and others
on whom the Government

338
00:14:25.788 --> 00:14:27.705
is spending 12 billion,
so there’s a real

339
00:14:27.705 --> 00:14:32.705
question of confidence...
0K. . .

340
00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:36.913
..and engagement with local leaders.

341
00:14:36.913 --> 00:14:39.622
And also, the key thing,
that financial support has to go

342
00:14:39.622 --> 00:14:41.955
hand in hand with those
restrictions, and the Government has

343
00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:44.622
not had the trust of local
authorities and local leaders that

344
00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:48.663
that is happening.

345
00:14:48.663 --> 00:14:53.663
Ian, there’s a great reluctance
to answer the question which Diane

346
00:14:57.747 --> 00:14:59.788
has put,
so I think we must try

347
00:14:59.788 --> 00:15:02.455
and do it justice,
which is "Do you think this pandemic

348
00:15:02.455 --> 00:15:04.830
has been managed better
by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than

349
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.538
it has by BorisJohnson in England?"

350
00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:09.163
So far none of the politicians
want to answer that question.

351
00:15:09.163 --> 00:15:10.205
0K.

352
00:15:10.205 --> 00:15:11.872
I honestly think it’s
the wrong question.

353
00:15:11.872 --> 00:15:13.080
But it is THE question.

354
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.122
That is the thing.

355
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.163
Well, 0K.

356
00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:17.788
Right now we are faced with probably
the biggest health crisis

357
00:15:17.788 --> 00:15:20.455
the world has ever had,
and that’s applying across the world

358
00:15:20.455 --> 00:15:22.622
— all countries are facing
a myriad of problems.

359
00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:27.622
I think in Scotland’s case, our
biggest tragedy was the care homes.

360
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.247
I think, generally,
we undoubtedly, on the first wave,

361
00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:34.622
restarted too quickly,
we tried to get going too quickly,

362
00:15:34.622 --> 00:15:37.413
and we now got a huge second wave.

363
00:15:37.413 --> 00:15:40.747
I think, frankly, with the students
coming back in the way they did —

364
00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:44.080
I hate to say this —
but I think that was a bad decision.

365
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.580
I think that’s undoubtedly added.

366
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.497
You think the universities
should have stayed closed?

367
00:15:47.497 --> 00:15:48.497
The real question...

368
00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:50.413
Well, not closed,
but done it all online.

369
00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:51.455
Perfectly feasible.

370
00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:54.247
The real question
is what do we do now?

371
00:15:54.247 --> 00:15:57.372
How do we keep working at this
problem and get past the second

372
00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:59.038
wave more successfully
than the first wave?

373
00:15:59.038 --> 00:16:00.747
That’s what we should
be concentrating on.

374
00:16:00.747 --> 00:16:03.872
We spend far too much time
in Scotland and the UK arguing who’s

375
00:16:03.872 --> 00:16:07.163
right and who’s wrong.

376
00:16:07.163 --> 00:16:10.538
We are now at a stage, frankly,
where we’ve got to make some clear

377
00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:12.663
decisions and try to get this
next stage right.

378
00:16:12.663 --> 00:16:14.330
Mark, you wanted to come back in.

379
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.372
Yes.

380
00:16:15.372 --> 00:16:18.955
I mean, what we have to do perhaps
to get on top of this infection,

381
00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:22.038
and that involves tight social
restrictions on movement,

382
00:16:22.038 --> 00:16:27.038
and only then will public health
measures work effectively,

383
00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:32.038
but we’ve got to get them working,
and as I say the real opportunity

384
00:16:32.038 --> 00:16:34.955
is to actually learn from what’s
been done abroad rather than having

385
00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:38.872
I think rather fruitless
internal competition

386
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.788
about whether Scotland
or England is doing better.

387
00:16:40.788 --> 00:16:42.038
They could both do better.

388
00:16:42.038 --> 00:16:44.080
Susan Young.

389
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.288
Yeah, just picking up on a point
that Douglas Ross made there,

390
00:16:48.288 --> 00:16:51.372
that he doesn’t feel that different
parts of the UK have done anything

391
00:16:51.372 --> 00:16:52.788
particularly different in handling
the pandemic,

392
00:16:52.788 --> 00:16:55.455
and yet that doesn’t equate
to the very, very clear public

393
00:16:55.455 --> 00:16:58.122
opinion polls as to who indeed has
handled it better between

394
00:16:58.122 --> 00:16:59.538
Nicola Sturgeon and Borisjohnson.

395
00:16:59.538 --> 00:17:01.455
So surely this absolutely comes
down to communication

396
00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:04.705
from the two governments.

397
00:17:04.705 --> 00:17:06.622
Whereas obviously we have very
clear communication daily

398
00:17:06.622 --> 00:17:09.330
from Nicola Sturgeon,
and yet not from Borisjohnson.

399
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.497
Is that, do you think,
Douglas, what the difference

400
00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.872
in opinion polls as?

401
00:17:13.872 --> 00:17:14.872
in opinion polls is?

402
00:17:14.872 --> 00:17:15.913
Miriam.

403
00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:16.955
Yeah.

404
00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:19.413
I think you’ve hit the nail
on the head there.

405
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:22.497
I think what one of the clearest
kind of distinctions between the two

406
00:17:22.497 --> 00:17:25.122
diverging approaches,
and I think it’s important

407
00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:30.080
to recognise here, that actually
we had a four nations approach

408
00:17:30.622 --> 00:17:33.830
beforehand which veered off path
when BorisJohnson decided to,

409
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.705
in my opinion, kind of pre—emptively
ease lockdown, and we’ve since seen

410
00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:40.163
a four nations approach.

411
00:17:40.163 --> 00:17:40.247
said,

412
00:17:40.247 --> 00:17:42.622
I think on your point
on messaging, that’s key —

413
00:17:42.622 --> 00:17:44.997
when polled, 80% of people
in Scotland said the Scottish

414
00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:49.788
Government has good communication,
and 72% of people in Scotland said

415
00:17:49.788 --> 00:17:52.163
that the UK Government has bad
communication strategyjust now,

416
00:17:52.163 --> 00:17:57.205
so I think that gets to really one
of the key distinctions there.

417
00:17:57.372 --> 00:18:00.330
More broadly, though, and Seema
touched upon that a moment ago,

418
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.205
I think one of the key issues
that we need to address in terms

419
00:18:04.205 --> 00:18:09.247
of our handling of this crisis more
broadly is the scale of outsourcing

420
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.788
that we have seen throughout
this entire pandemic.

421
00:18:13.788 --> 00:18:16.705
We are seeing consultants
being brought in for a week

422
00:18:16.705 --> 00:18:21.247
who are being paid a year’s worth
of nurses’ salaries.

423
00:18:21.247 --> 00:18:24.413
We are seeing Deloitte, Serco,
McKinsey, being brought in —

424
00:18:24.413 --> 00:18:28.372
consultancy firms who are looking
to maximise profit and who do not

425
00:18:28.372 --> 00:18:33.330
have expertise in public health —
are being brought in to oversee how

426
00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:37.663
we respond to test, track and trace.

427
00:18:37.663 --> 00:18:40.955
Now, that, for me,
is an abject failure.

428
00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:45.997
Why should the taxes of key workers
who are trying so hard just now

429
00:18:47.413 --> 00:18:51.205
to help alleviate this crisis line
the pockets of corporations who

430
00:18:51.205 --> 00:18:54.622
are not experts in public health?

431
00:18:54.622 --> 00:18:58.038
So for me what we need
to do, if it is the case

432
00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:00.205
that we are recommended
to have a circuit break,

433
00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:03.038
if it is the case that we are
recommended to have another

434
00:19:03.038 --> 00:19:05.955
lockdown, we need to take a moment,
step back, reassess our current

435
00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:10.788
approach and recognise that public
health should be in public hands

436
00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:14.247
and use that as the mantra
going forward to guide us.

437
00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:19.205
So, Douglas, what did you think
when we saw today about private

438
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.747
consultants getting up to seven
grand a day in terms

439
00:19:21.747 --> 00:19:22.747
of helping the Government?

440
00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:23.955
Do you think that right?

441
00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.872
Is that where the money
should be going?

442
00:19:25.872 --> 00:19:28.497
Well, I think we’ve also got
to remember during this pandemic

443
00:19:28.497 --> 00:19:30.872
the private sector have been
involved in terms of generating

444
00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:31.955
the ventilation capacity.

445
00:19:31.955 --> 00:19:33.872
Right at the start
of the biggest concern

446
00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:36.788
in Scotland and across the UK
was that we wouldn’t have that...

447
00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:38.705
But what about the point
that Miriam’s making?

448
00:19:38.705 --> 00:19:41.538
So I think we’ve got to remember
the private sector have worked

449
00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:43.455
with the public sector to ensure...

450
00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:45.872
Sure, but in terms of the point
that Miriam’s making,

451
00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:47.788
consultants getting seven
grand a day?

452
00:19:47.788 --> 00:19:50.497
Well, you know, I’m not
going to defend levels like that,

453
00:19:50.497 --> 00:19:53.122
but we can’t just say that
all of the private sector

454
00:19:53.122 --> 00:19:54.330
was wrong to get involved...

455
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.205
I mean, obviously, your
Government’s paying for it.

456
00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:58.538
Well, we’re paying for it, you know.

457
00:19:58.538 --> 00:20:00.247
As in the taxpayer’s paying for it.

458
00:20:00.247 --> 00:20:02.413
Susan, Lucas and Grant
have all made the point,

459
00:20:02.413 --> 00:20:06.080
and I don’t think anyone on this
panel from the respective parties

460
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.955
and quite opposing party political
views has been able to say anything

461
00:20:08.955 --> 00:20:10.955
that the Scottish Government
have done differently

462
00:20:10.955 --> 00:20:12.330
from the UK Government.

463
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.497
It has been a UK—wide
approach, it is one...

464
00:20:14.497 --> 00:20:15.538
Well, I can.

465
00:20:15.538 --> 00:20:18.163
It is one that has largely been
the same right across...

466
00:20:18.163 --> 00:20:20.538
Yeah, but different measures have
been taken at different times.

467
00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:21.997
But I do agree with Susan.

468
00:20:21.997 --> 00:20:24.122
It does come down to communications,
because Nicola Sturgeon...

469
00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:25.122
It’s not just communication.

470
00:20:25.122 --> 00:20:27.288
Sorry, Kate, if I canjust
finish, Nicola Sturgeon

471
00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:28.538
is a very good communicator.

472
00:20:28.538 --> 00:20:30.913
She is on our television every
day in Scotland doing

473
00:20:30.913 --> 00:20:33.580
the daily briefings,
but when it comes down to the detail

474
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.705
we still have, as you said, Fiona,
the highest R rate anywhere

475
00:20:36.705 --> 00:20:38.830
in the United Kingdom,
the highest percentage of deaths

476
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.288
in care homes anywhere
in the United Kingdom,

477
00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:46.038
one of the highest death rates
per head of population in Europe.

478
00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:49.580
So there are clear challenges we’ve
got to face, and as Sir Ian said,

479
00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.663
we got to learn from the mistakes
we’ve made because we are seven

480
00:20:52.663 --> 00:20:55.622
months into this pandemic now
and we are probably closer

481
00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:59.330
to where we were in March than
we are at the end of this crisis.

482
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.163
We’ve still got a lot to go through,
we’ve still got a lot to learn from,

483
00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:06.080
and we cannot make the same mistakes
in the next seven months...

484
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.080
Absolutely.

485
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.247
..that have been made
in the seven months before.

486
00:21:09.247 --> 00:21:10.288
The most important lesson...

487
00:21:10.288 --> 00:21:12.455
And that’s why, Kate,
your government has to explain

488
00:21:12.455 --> 00:21:13.663
what happened to these people...

489
00:21:13.663 --> 00:21:15.788
The most important lesson
to learn is moving quickly,

490
00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:18.205
well they might if we’ve learned
anything from the beginning

491
00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:20.830
of the pandemic back in March,
it’s that the more decisively

492
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.538
you act, the quicker you act,
the faster you can suppress

493
00:21:23.538 --> 00:21:25.163
the virus and get it under control.

494
00:21:25.163 --> 00:21:26.205
Now, Seema talked about...

495
00:21:26.205 --> 00:21:28.622
So why is the R rate
so high in Scotland?

496
00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:30.788
Seema talked about the need
for a circuit breaker.

497
00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:33.663
Now, she may be aware
that we are currently in the midst

498
00:21:33.663 --> 00:21:34.747
of increased lockdown restrictions.

499
00:21:34.747 --> 00:21:37.080
Some of them are localised,
but we have national restrictions

500
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.788
right across Scotland right now,
and the idea is working quickly

501
00:21:39.788 --> 00:21:43.288
and decisively with this two—week
period to try and bring the numbers

502
00:21:43.288 --> 00:21:47.705
under control, and it’s not acting
quickly that matters.

503
00:21:47.705 --> 00:21:51.163
But if, as you say, Kate —
because it is a puzzle,

504
00:21:51.163 --> 00:21:54.080
and I’m not necessarily sure you’ll
have the answer — but if,

505
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.538
as you say, Nicola Sturgeon
is acting quickly and her

506
00:21:56.538 --> 00:21:58.747
communication skills are good,
why is the infection rate

507
00:21:58.747 --> 00:22:00.788
so high in Scotland?

508
00:22:00.788 --> 00:22:01.830
What’s going on?

509
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.538
But you’re choosing one
infection rate, you’re

510
00:22:03.538 --> 00:22:04.747
talking about the R number.

511
00:22:04.747 --> 00:22:05.788
What I’m talking about...

512
00:22:05.788 --> 00:22:06.788
Well, it’s pretty important.

513
00:22:06.788 --> 00:22:09.455
It’s important, but what we really
look at at the moment

514
00:22:09.455 --> 00:22:10.705
is the rates per 100,000.

515
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:11.705
That’s what matters.

516
00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:15.080
And in terms of across the UK,
if you look at the figures rising,

517
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.788
the Prime Minister announced
his three—tier approach.

518
00:22:16.788 --> 00:22:20.122
I’m not sure that will go far enough
in terms of suppressing the virus

519
00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:21.788
in the way that we need to.

520
00:22:21.788 --> 00:22:25.413
We are in the midst of a two—week
increased lockdown right now.

521
00:22:25.413 --> 00:22:27.788
But the other difference —
it’s notjust about communication,

522
00:22:27.788 --> 00:22:30.913
because this requires the public’s
consent and it requires political

523
00:22:30.913 --> 00:22:33.663
leader clinic to treat
the public like adults,

524
00:22:33.663 --> 00:22:36.080
ultimately we are depended
on the public following the rules

525
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.038
and regulations and understanding
the evidence behind it,

526
00:22:41.038 --> 00:22:44.163
and that is the key to communication
and that’s what I think

527
00:22:44.163 --> 00:22:45.872
distinguishes the First Minister
from the Prime Minister.

528
00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:47.288
There’s quite a few hands up.

529
00:22:47.288 --> 00:22:48.747
Let’s hear from some of them.

530
00:22:48.747 --> 00:22:49.788
Toby?

531
00:22:49.788 --> 00:22:50.788
Thank you.

532
00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:53.705
I feel like as a young person
it’s very easy for me

533
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:54.747
to answer this question.

534
00:22:54.747 --> 00:22:57.622
Nicola Sturgeon wasn’t the one
who had one of his chief advisers

535
00:22:57.622 --> 00:23:02.622
break the lockdown rules and then
not even be effectively criticised.

536
00:23:04.538 --> 00:23:07.455
I mean, from that perspective,
I feel like itjust sums up

537
00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:12.038
BorisJohnson’s whole approach
to the whole pandemic.

538
00:23:12.038 --> 00:23:13.413
Kate?

539
00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:14.413
Hi.

540
00:23:14.413 --> 00:23:15.455
Yes.

541
00:23:15.455 --> 00:23:18.288
Douglas says that nobody can
point to any difference.

542
00:23:18.288 --> 00:23:21.705
I think he’s missing the point,
that this is about leadership.

543
00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:26.205
It’s not about numbers.

544
00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:28.747
Looking simply at numbers disregards
that, that if you don’t

545
00:23:28.747 --> 00:23:31.288
have the people with you,
regardless of how hard

546
00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:34.663
you lockdown, you’re not
going to get people to comply —

547
00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:37.247
you’re going to actually get people
starting to believe all kinds

548
00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:39.163
of conspiracy theories,
and you’re going to end

549
00:23:39.163 --> 00:23:41.580
up with noncompliance.

550
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.538
So this is about a difference
in leadership, hearts and minds.

551
00:23:44.538 --> 00:23:47.413
It isn’t about a
difference in R rates.

552
00:23:47.413 --> 00:23:49.788
Diane, you ask the question.

553
00:23:49.788 --> 00:23:51.288
What you think about what heard?

554
00:23:51.288 --> 00:23:54.122
Yeah, certainly I don’t think
it was a competition and that wasn’t

555
00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:59.163
why I asked the question,
but I do feel that Nicola Sturgeon

556
00:23:59.247 --> 00:24:01.538
has communicated very well.

557
00:24:01.538 --> 00:24:06.580
She hasn’t shied away from questions
from the press and TV presenters,

558
00:24:07.705 --> 00:24:12.122
as Boris and his ministers have
done, and I think she has made clear

559
00:24:12.122 --> 00:24:15.038
cut decisions that she has explained
well and she’s earned the respect

560
00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:19.997
from the people, and, you know,
she needs the people on board

561
00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:24.372
to follow what she wants them to do,
and that’s precisely what she’s

562
00:24:24.372 --> 00:24:29.330
doing, rather than hiding away
like Boris is doing.

563
00:24:29.788 --> 00:24:33.538
Well, I’m going to move on,
if I may, because you had

564
00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:34.747
a good go, Douglas.

565
00:24:34.747 --> 00:24:37.080
There will be other
things for you to say.

566
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.247
Just on the quick action
of the Scottish Government,

567
00:24:39.247 --> 00:24:40.705
if I can, just very quickly...

568
00:24:40.705 --> 00:24:41.747
Very briefly.

569
00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:43.413
It’s really important
there is quick action,

570
00:24:43.413 --> 00:24:45.788
but also quick action
for the businesses affected and Kate

571
00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:48.413
is Finance Secretary here
in Scotland and they are waiting ten

572
00:24:48.413 --> 00:24:49.705
days now to get information...

573
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:52.080
A far more generous package
of support than the UK

574
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.538
Government is providing.

575
00:24:53.538 --> 00:24:54.622
That matters.

576
00:24:54.622 --> 00:24:58.163
They were told to close at 51 hours’
notice and they had to wait ten

577
00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.080
days to find out they’re
getting £40 million.

578
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.247
We don’t know how that is going
to be delivered, and that pales

579
00:25:03.247 --> 00:25:04.247
into insignificance. ..

580
00:25:04.247 --> 00:25:06.163
And we’ve got the end
of the furlough...

581
00:25:06.163 --> 00:25:08.080
..The £700 million that
the Chancellor’s making available...

582
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.038
..costing Scottish jobs,
in a few weeks’ time.

583
00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:13.163
Please, Kate, just use your speed
and your urgency to get that money

584
00:25:13.163 --> 00:25:14.205
out to businesses, please.

585
00:25:14.205 --> 00:25:17.038
We are going to come onto business,
OK, but before we do,

586
00:25:17.038 --> 00:25:20.455
because I want to get another
question in — I want to mention that

587
00:25:20.455 --> 00:25:23.288
next week we are looking for people
to join a virtual audience

588
00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:28.330
in Sedgefield, and a week
after that in Lincoln,

589
00:25:29.247 --> 00:25:30.872
if you live in the area do,

590
00:25:30.872 --> 00:25:31.955
please, get in touch.

591
00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:35.288
Go to the Question Time website
and you can fill in the form there.

592
00:25:35.288 --> 00:25:36.372
Do get involved.

593
00:25:36.372 --> 00:25:37.788
We love to hear from you.

594
00:25:37.788 --> 00:25:39.247
Be part of their virtual audience.

595
00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:40.913
Right, let’s come
to our next question,

596
00:25:40.913 --> 00:25:42.080
which is from Martin Dundas...

597
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.163
Thanks, Fiona.

598
00:25:43.163 --> 00:25:45.580
When is cafe a restaurant
and a restaurant a bar?

599
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.955
And does it differ in Edinburgh,
Cardiff, Belfast or London?

600
00:25:47.955 --> 00:25:49.413
Well, thank you for that, Martin.

601
00:25:49.413 --> 00:25:50.580
I’m looking at the regulations.

602
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.038
So let’s take cafe, for example.

603
00:25:52.038 --> 00:25:54.830
So you can sit down and eat
in a cafe in Edinburgh,

604
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.288
but only between 63m and 6pm.

605
00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:59.205
They close at 10pm in London
and in Cardiff, and they’re shut

606
00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:01.122
altogether in Belfast.

607
00:26:01.122 --> 00:26:03.580
Mark, do you want to
kick us off with this?

608
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.622
Yes, sure.

609
00:26:10.872 --> 00:26:15.830
I mean the first thing to say
is that this virus transmits

610
00:26:18.872 --> 00:26:21.538
in indoor spaces more easily than it
does in the outside,

611
00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:24.372
and the second thing is that,
going back to the last question,

612
00:26:24.372 --> 00:26:27.788
the reason the numbers are not going
down is because we are on average

613
00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:30.622
making too many social contacts,
and so we know that the lockdown

614
00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:33.038
works because when this pandemic
started, with tight restrictions it

615
00:26:33.038 --> 00:26:34.080
did come under control.

616
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.247
And restaurants, cafes,
it depends how people are seated,

617
00:26:36.247 --> 00:26:40.830
how people behave, it depends
whether they are inside or outside,

618
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.955
and I think that when you read
through, and I read through before

619
00:26:43.955 --> 00:26:48.955
coming on this all the different
restrictions — I look

620
00:26:53.788 --> 00:26:55.455
at Northern Ireland,
at Scotland, at Wales,

621
00:26:55.455 --> 00:26:57.622
I looked at England —
it is very confusing

622
00:26:57.622 --> 00:26:58.705
and it is different.

623
00:26:58.705 --> 00:27:01.580
The bottom line is that we need
to reduce our social contact,

624
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.705
and until we get it down similar
to the levels that we started

625
00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:06.830
with this is not going
to come under control.

626
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.955
And, frankly, we do need to get
on top of the second wave,

627
00:27:09.955 --> 00:27:12.580
and urgency does matter,
and so we’ve just got to get

628
00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.747
on with it, and I don’t think it’s
helpful having lots of different

629
00:27:15.747 --> 00:27:16.788
hard to understand rules.

630
00:27:16.788 --> 00:27:19.413
As a scientist, just help us
understand, does it make sense,

631
00:27:19.413 --> 00:27:21.038
then, scientifically,
that the rules are different

632
00:27:21.038 --> 00:27:22.122
in these different areas?

633
00:27:22.122 --> 00:27:25.247
Well, I mean the first thing to say
is that there is not

634
00:27:25.247 --> 00:27:28.122
a perfect science that says,
you know, there isn’t a science that

635
00:27:28.122 --> 00:27:31.705
says what a restaurant is or a cafe,
and nor is there a specific science

636
00:27:31.705 --> 00:27:34.122
that says six people or five
people or seven people.

637
00:27:34.122 --> 00:27:36.538
What has to happen is that our
social distancing has

638
00:27:36.538 --> 00:27:37.580
got to be maintained.

639
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.497
And of course we all
in this together.

640
00:27:39.497 --> 00:27:41.372
I mean, everyone has
a responsibility here.

641
00:27:41.372 --> 00:27:44.497
But the rules have got to be clear,
and I think the argument

642
00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:46.663
for a circuit breaker
is that it is tough

643
00:27:46.663 --> 00:27:48.705
but it is relatively short.

644
00:27:48.705 --> 00:27:51.330
As we heard earlier,
in a month’s time, if we can

645
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.580
get the numbers down,
then we’ve got to get testing

646
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.122
and tracing on top of it rather
than chasing behind.

647
00:27:58.122 --> 00:28:00.538
At the moment, although the numbers
of available test has

648
00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:03.497
gone up dramatically,
it still chasing demand,

649
00:28:03.497 --> 00:28:07.080
and we are only going to decrease
the demand if we actually get on top

650
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.747
of it, and then we can really focus
on outbreak control,

651
00:28:09.747 --> 00:28:12.455
on testing in environments
where the risk is higher,

652
00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:13.913
testing and the health system.

653
00:28:13.913 --> 00:28:15.705
That’s what we have to do.

654
00:28:15.705 --> 00:28:17.872
So your advice would be
to shut them altogether,

655
00:28:17.872 --> 00:28:21.830
for a brief period, orfor a period,
whatever the length?

656
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.538
For a brief period of time,
we’ve really got to get

657
00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:25.580
this under control.

658
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.622
No question.

659
00:28:26.622 --> 00:28:27.663
Jim?

660
00:28:27.663 --> 00:28:29.497
Thanks, Fiona.

661
00:28:29.497 --> 00:28:32.372
Can the panel please explain to me,
following on from Martin’s question,

662
00:28:32.372 --> 00:28:34.580
how the Government is going
to expect employers

663
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.955
in the hospitality sector,
in pubs and wine bars,

664
00:28:36.955 --> 00:28:41.372
to be able to pay their employees’
wages when their businesses

665
00:28:41.372 --> 00:28:43.788
are closed and there is actually no
money coming in?

666
00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:45.497
Itjust doesn’t add up.

667
00:28:45.497 --> 00:28:47.247
Graham, you had your hand up.

668
00:28:47.247 --> 00:28:49.913
Thank you, Fiona.

669
00:28:49.913 --> 00:28:52.997
Again, the level of difference
here across the four nations,

670
00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:55.080
it’s adding to the confusion.

671
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.747
Is it the case that, actually,
it’s a role for some but not for me

672
00:28:58.747 --> 00:29:01.580
because I’lljust pretend I’m
in Cardiff for the purposes of this

673
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.747
meeting or the lunch
that I’m having as well?

674
00:29:03.747 --> 00:29:07.205
I think it’s just too difficult
for people to interpret the rules.

675
00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:10.288
It’s too easy for them
to interpret it for themselves.

676
00:29:10.288 --> 00:29:13.455
So I think looking at the Sage
advice and making the local lockdown

677
00:29:13.455 --> 00:29:16.205
nationwide has to be
the way forward.

678
00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:17.538
Colin?

679
00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:18.955
Thanks, Fiona.

680
00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:23.788
I think there is a point
being missed by a lot of the panel

681
00:29:23.788 --> 00:29:28.788
that Mark onlyjust mentioned
at the end of his point,

682
00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:33.247
that the lockdowns are supposed
to be a time to break the chain

683
00:29:33.247 --> 00:29:38.247
of infection and give time to bring
up the testing and tracing system

684
00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:40.830
to a suitable level so that that
takes over and brings

685
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.205
down the level.

686
00:29:42.205 --> 00:29:45.330
Why are we not hearing
enough about that?

687
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.747
0K.

688
00:29:46.747 --> 00:29:50.163
Miriam?

689
00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:52.788
I mean, this is a sort of two—part
question from Martin,

690
00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:55.455
and obviously our audience has
thrown in their ten—penneth as well.

691
00:29:55.455 --> 00:29:57.622
When is a cafe restaurant,
a restaurant a bar?

692
00:29:57.622 --> 00:30:01.580
Because obviously that affects
whether they can open or not.

693
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.705
And also the fact that it is
different in the four nations.

694
00:30:04.705 --> 00:30:07.955
Do you think it should be one
message, as we’ve heard there?

695
00:30:07.955 --> 00:30:09.247
I mean just now...

696
00:30:09.247 --> 00:30:11.788
Well, firstly, there
obviously has been confusion

697
00:30:11.788 --> 00:30:14.372
about what constitutes as a cafe
and a bar, and we’ve

698
00:30:14.372 --> 00:30:16.705
seen that replicated
elsewhere in the UK as well.

699
00:30:16.705 --> 00:30:21.663
We were hearing RobertJenrick
in the UK Government

700
00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.288
cabinet saying that,
because obviously if you’re

701
00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:28.788
going to eat food in a restaurant
or in a cafe in the UK,

702
00:30:28.788 --> 00:30:31.538
in certain parts of the UK,
or in the pub, rather,

703
00:30:31.538 --> 00:30:34.997
that they have to serve
a substantial meal.

704
00:30:34.997 --> 00:30:38.372
He was asked, "Could it be
a pastyT’, so it could be a pasty

705
00:30:38.372 --> 00:30:40.997
if it had a side salad,
or if it had chips.

706
00:30:40.997 --> 00:30:43.913
I mean, if we are dealing with that
level of complexity it’s

707
00:30:43.913 --> 00:30:44.913
very hard to navigate.

708
00:30:44.913 --> 00:30:46.163
Yeah, and I understand that.

709
00:30:46.163 --> 00:30:49.497
In terms of whether we would
have nationwide in the

710
00:30:49.497 --> 00:30:52.413
sense of a UK wide lockdown
the practicalities of that I think

711
00:30:52.413 --> 00:30:54.330
would be very difficult now
for all four

712
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:59.288
nations because we’ve all gone
in different directions.

713
00:31:00.288 --> 00:31:03.122
I think what we need to do
just now is listen to

714
00:31:03.122 --> 00:31:06.205
the public health advice and follow
whatever it is we ask that the

715
00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:07.288
there.

716
00:31:07.288 --> 00:31:09.205
I think that’s first
and foremost the issue.

717
00:31:09.205 --> 00:31:11.622
I think on the point
on hospitality, there is a

718
00:31:11.622 --> 00:31:13.080
point being overlooked here as well.

719
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.455
Which is that hospitality, and I say
this is somebody who worked in the

720
00:31:16.455 --> 00:31:19.080
industry for a long time,
is an area that is very,

721
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.497
very insecure at the best of times
for workers, and, you

722
00:31:23.497 --> 00:31:26.788
know, we have seen kind of a lot
of zero—hour contracts, a lot of

723
00:31:26.788 --> 00:31:31.163
precarious employment in
the hospitality sector already, and

724
00:31:31.163 --> 00:31:33.663
actually with this pandemic,
as with so much of it,

725
00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:37.872
what it has served to do is not only
create new

726
00:31:37.872 --> 00:31:42.872
vulnerabilities but expose fractures
in our economy that already existed,

727
00:31:50.788 --> 00:31:52.747
The furlough scheme
was mentioned there and I

728
00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:53.955
want to touch upon that.

729
00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:55.872
What we have a replacement
for the furlough

730
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:59.247
scheme is much better than the cliff
edge that they were looking to do.

731
00:31:59.247 --> 00:32:00.413
It is still deeply inadequate.

732
00:32:00.413 --> 00:32:02.330
It only covers areas
that are in lockdown

733
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.080
and we are still asking people
in many circumstances to make

734
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.413
a significant cut to their wages.

735
00:32:06.413 --> 00:32:08.122
Are they getting
cuts off their rent? cut

736
00:32:08.122 --> 00:32:10.247
off their bills, their food?

737
00:32:10.247 --> 00:32:11.288
No.

738
00:32:11.288 --> 00:32:14.497
What I would like to see
is a roll—out of the

739
00:32:14.497 --> 00:32:19.455
initial furlough initiative that
covers not only areas in lockdown

740
00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:23.872
but also other areas so that we can
cover areas like the performing arts

741
00:32:23.872 --> 00:32:28.122
and the creative sector that
actually are going to remain

742
00:32:28.122 --> 00:32:29.538
relatively closed for
the foreseeable future.

743
00:32:29.538 --> 00:32:31.955
On the point, and this
is my last point, on

744
00:32:31.955 --> 00:32:34.622
hospitality here, when
we inherit out of this

745
00:32:34.622 --> 00:32:36.080
crisis we need to see
a

746
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.997
new deal for workers,
because this has exposed

747
00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:40.163
vulnerabilities that existed for far
too long in our

748
00:32:40.163 --> 00:32:42.705
economy.

749
00:32:42.705 --> 00:32:45.372
We need to ban zero—hour contracts,
we need to root out

750
00:32:45.372 --> 00:32:48.497
precarious work, and we need a real
living wage case that all workers

751
00:32:48.497 --> 00:32:49.497
throughout the UK.

752
00:32:49.497 --> 00:32:51.622
So...

753
00:32:51.622 --> 00:32:53.788
Sorry, I was just going
to come to Douglas.

754
00:32:53.788 --> 00:32:55.705
If you want tojump in, Ian, sorry.

755
00:32:55.705 --> 00:32:56.747
Yeah.

756
00:32:56.747 --> 00:32:58.872
I’m going to begin
the same point again.

757
00:32:58.872 --> 00:33:02.622
There is a huge, big challenge
and problem out there

758
00:33:02.622 --> 00:33:05.288
and, frankly, we are talking about
not unimportant issues, but not

759
00:33:05.288 --> 00:33:08.538
primary issues.

760
00:33:08.538 --> 00:33:09.913
I think the breakthrough
appeared three—tiered

761
00:33:09.913 --> 00:33:11.622
approach.

762
00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:13.830
You know, clearly the country’s
being affected in

763
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.747
different ways, and it’s absolutely
right that some parts of the country

764
00:33:16.747 --> 00:33:19.122
should be subjected to different
rules and regulations than others,

765
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:21.788
so the three—tier approach is a good
approach, and definitely should

766
00:33:21.788 --> 00:33:22.788
the...

767
00:33:30.247 --> 00:33:30.788
ii

768
00:33:30.788 --> 00:33:32.413
It should be pursued, with great
rare

769
00:33:32.413 --> 00:33:34.080
It should be pursued, with great
care taken as to what the lockdown

770
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.288
rare taken as to what the lockdown
issues

771
00:33:34.288 --> 00:33:35.497
care taken as to what the lockdown
issues are and how they might be

772
00:33:35.497 --> 00:33:37.997
issues are and how they might be
applied.

773
00:33:37.997 --> 00:33:39.663
In terms of hospitality,
I’ve got three

774
00:33:39.663 --> 00:33:41.538
sons, two of which are
very heavily involved

775
00:33:41.538 --> 00:33:44.455
in pubs and restaurants
and

776
00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:48.872
bars, so I clearly follow
that quite carefully.

777
00:33:48.872 --> 00:33:51.788
One thing you must remember,
there are a huge number of young

778
00:33:51.788 --> 00:33:53.455
people employed,
and one of the biggest

779
00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:54.872
concerns I have is we
are

780
00:33:54.872 --> 00:33:58.205
going to finish up with a lot of
young people unemployed, so I really

781
00:33:58.205 --> 00:33:59.913
hope we can do something
significant with

782
00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:02.288
hospitality and try and prevent
what could be very significant

783
00:34:02.288 --> 00:34:05.538
unemployment in that area.

784
00:34:05.538 --> 00:34:10.205
Douglas, I mean, hearing
what Miriam’s had to

785
00:34:10.205 --> 00:34:13.330
say and what Ian’s had to say,
in terms of young people’s

786
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.913
unemployment and the furlough
falling off a cliff, do you think

787
00:34:15.913 --> 00:34:17.413
BorisJohnson should be doing more?

788
00:34:17.413 --> 00:34:19.788
So it’s not falling off
a cliff, and I think

789
00:34:19.788 --> 00:34:24.455
that was actually Miriam’s point.

790
00:34:24.455 --> 00:34:26.788
What we have now, first of all,
the furlough scheme...

791
00:34:26.788 --> 00:34:28.747
It’s significantly reduced
in terms of the money

792
00:34:28.747 --> 00:34:29.955
people are going to get.

793
00:34:29.955 --> 00:34:33.747
But when it was introduced it has
protected 9.6 millionjobs

794
00:34:33.747 --> 00:34:37.163
across the United Kingdom, £40
billion of taxpayer money has been

795
00:34:37.163 --> 00:34:39.622
invested protecting these jobs,
{13.5 billion going to the self

796
00:34:39.622 --> 00:34:42.080
employed with about
5 million claims.

797
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.997
This has been a significant,
and one of the most generous schemes

798
00:34:44.997 --> 00:34:46.747
anywhere in the world.

799
00:34:46.747 --> 00:34:48.205
But then you’ve got
Greater Manchester,

800
00:34:48.205 --> 00:34:50.122
the Mayor of Greater
Manchester, in open revolt.

801
00:34:50.122 --> 00:34:52.747
I mean, surely this is not good
for Borisjohnson, because

802
00:34:52.747 --> 00:34:55.872
clearly he wants to bring in some
kind of extra restrictions there and

803
00:34:55.872 --> 00:35:00.497
he has a fight on his hands?

804
00:35:00.497 --> 00:35:02.413
Now, the replacement scheme
is actually very similar,

805
00:35:02.413 --> 00:35:04.580
if you look at the levels of support
that

806
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.997
individuals and employers
have in France,

807
00:35:05.997 --> 00:35:07.413
in Spain, in Germany,
it is

808
00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:10.080
very similar to the two thirds
that the government are paying

809
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.997
in in the United Kingdom compared
to other

810
00:35:11.997 --> 00:35:15.830
countries.

811
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.247
But Ian is absolutely right,
because young people are effectively

812
00:35:18.247 --> 00:35:21.538
the ones that could potentially be
the most affected by this.

813
00:35:21.538 --> 00:35:24.872
First of all, their education, so
many of them did not get to finish

814
00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:27.288
their school education,
they did not get to sit exams,

815
00:35:27.288 --> 00:35:29.455
they went on to college
and university in Scotland

816
00:35:29.455 --> 00:35:31.372
and in other parts
of the United Kingdom,

817
00:35:31.372 --> 00:35:33.788
they had a terrible initial
experience at university, and now

818
00:35:33.788 --> 00:35:37.622
they are going to be paying for this
for much of their lives and the job

819
00:35:37.622 --> 00:35:40.455
market, economic emergency
that we are all going to face is one

820
00:35:40.455 --> 00:35:42.413
that we have to try and treat
extremely

821
00:35:42.413 --> 00:35:47.413
seriously, and I think it is really
young people that we have got to be

822
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:53.372
thinking about and that is why
the UK Government have introduced

823
00:36:00.788 --> 00:36:03.997
the kick—start scheme and many other
schemes to help young

824
00:36:03.997 --> 00:36:06.788
people into employment,
but, again,

825
00:36:06.788 --> 00:36:09.413
as the Chancellor has said
and the Prime Minister has said,

826
00:36:09.413 --> 00:36:12.038
it is going to be impossible
to save every single job,

827
00:36:12.038 --> 00:36:14.705
but we are putting in place
the tools to hopefully protect

828
00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:17.788
as many of them as possible,
as we have done with the furlough

829
00:36:17.788 --> 00:36:19.497
scheme and the replacement
scheme going forward.

830
00:36:19.497 --> 00:36:20.580
Seema Malhotra.

831
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.913
Well, I was very surprised
to hear that the Job

832
00:36:22.913 --> 00:36:24.830
Support Scheme was talked
about by Douglas Ross

833
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.497
there as being the same
as the furlough scheme, almost the

834
00:36:27.497 --> 00:36:30.622
same, even though Louise Casey has
come out saying that if you are

835
00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:33.955
going to say that you are going to
pay two thirds of someone’s salary,

836
00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:37.080
you should also be saying
that they are only going to be able

837
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.747
to for two thirds of their rent
or pay for two

838
00:36:39.747 --> 00:36:42.163
thirds of the food for their family.

839
00:36:42.163 --> 00:36:44.580
We have got a system
that is currently, and decisions

840
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.497
being made by the Prime Minister
and the Chancellor, that are pushing

841
00:36:48.497 --> 00:36:51.163
people towards destitution,
and the most important thing I think

842
00:36:51.163 --> 00:36:55.247
we need to do right now is to look
at how we both deal with the health

843
00:36:55.247 --> 00:37:00.247
crisis that we are facing,
as well as the economic crisis.

844
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.497
TheJob Support Scheme,
I have had many employers tell me,

845
00:37:04.497 --> 00:37:08.580
that it is not going to incentivise
them to keep on employees,

846
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.205
especially as times get tough again,
and many in the aviation industry

847
00:37:12.205 --> 00:37:17.247
as well who are suffering from
the slowdown and that is because,

848
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:28.122
actually it is more
expensive to keep people on

849
00:37:30.163 --> 00:37:32.038
part—time — to keep two
people on part—time

850
00:37:32.038 --> 00:37:37.038
than it is to keep one person
on full—time and rather than this,

851
00:37:40.247 --> 00:37:42.663
and they should be looking,
the government should be looking

852
00:37:42.663 --> 00:37:47.122
at what is being done
in Germany and elsewhere

853
00:37:47.122 --> 00:37:50.538
and what the Labour Party has been
saying, to have a proper short hours

854
00:37:50.538 --> 00:37:53.622
scheme that supports people to stay
in work and in theirjobs part—time,

855
00:37:53.622 --> 00:37:55.788
because the cost of long—term
unemployment is much greater

856
00:37:55.788 --> 00:37:58.872
than what we are going to otherwise
have to pay to keep people

857
00:37:58.872 --> 00:38:01.997
in theirjobs, in viable jobs,
that will be there when we come

858
00:38:01.997 --> 00:38:05.372
through this next period and Ijust
want to come back to this first

859
00:38:05.372 --> 00:38:07.788
question as well, when we were
talking about how have

860
00:38:07.788 --> 00:38:09.705
we done under BorisJohnson
versus Nicola Sturgeon,

861
00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:13.038
and let’s be clear, we have had some
of the worst excess death rates

862
00:38:13.038 --> 00:38:14.080
in the world.

863
00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.913
Neither has done as well as
they needed to, for our

864
00:38:18.913 --> 00:38:21.788
country, and nor have other
countries have done, and now we are

865
00:38:21.788 --> 00:38:23.747
headed for the worst financial
recession, economic recession,

866
00:38:23.747 --> 00:38:26.122
certainly in Europe,
and I think we have to ask

867
00:38:26.122 --> 00:38:27.247
questions about what
is

868
00:38:27.247 --> 00:38:32.288
going wrong, and we have
to ask those questions

869
00:38:33.622 --> 00:38:38.580
honestly, the Government
has to answer those questions

870
00:38:38.913 --> 00:38:42.330
honestly, and I think that is why it
is important that they continue to

871
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.455
work with the opposition, to listen
to the opposition.

872
00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:47.330
We do need a four nation
approach and we do need to

873
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.205
take the job losses
that are there now

874
00:38:49.205 --> 00:38:50.705
and could be coming,
with a

875
00:38:50.705 --> 00:38:53.580
million facing a cliff edge
at the end of October much more

876
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.205
seriously than the government
is doing now.

877
00:38:55.205 --> 00:38:56.288
Grant.

878
00:38:56.288 --> 00:38:57.372
Thanks, Fiona.

879
00:38:57.372 --> 00:39:00.413
If we are looking for money,
why don’t we, here is a radical

880
00:39:00.413 --> 00:39:04.788
suggestion along the lines of

881
00:39:04.788 --> 00:39:05.580
Yanis Va roufakis this

882
00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.622
Yanis Varoufakis this week.

883
00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:15.247
The billions of pounds
that they have been giving

884
00:39:15.247 --> 00:39:17.413
to management consultants,
instead of giving it to them,

885
00:39:17.413 --> 00:39:20.038
why don’t we give it to local
leaders like Andy Burnham,

886
00:39:20.038 --> 00:39:23.205
for his local Test and Trace regime,
let us give it to hospitality

887
00:39:23.205 --> 00:39:24.872
workers, and entertainment
workers who so desperately

888
00:39:24.872 --> 00:39:25.913
needed and been failed?

889
00:39:25.913 --> 00:39:26.913
Yvonne.

890
00:39:26.913 --> 00:39:27.955
Hi.

891
00:39:27.955 --> 00:39:30.372
Like many people, I am really
surprised that when Rishi

892
00:39:30.372 --> 00:39:33.497
Sunak made this announcement back in
March, to support, to put his arms

893
00:39:33.497 --> 00:39:35.872
around everybody and supporters,
that this would suddenly stop, which

894
00:39:35.872 --> 00:39:37.580
feels like it is about to happen.

895
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.455
Because, if we were at war,
we would have a war chest

896
00:39:40.455 --> 00:39:43.122
and we would be continuing,
you would not give up at

897
00:39:43.122 --> 00:39:46.205
the seven months or whatever and I
feel like the Government has went

898
00:39:46.205 --> 00:39:48.122
into one gear and they
have totally shifted

899
00:39:48.122 --> 00:39:49.580
into another one now,
in the

900
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.747
future is looking bleak now for lots
of different people in lots of

901
00:39:52.747 --> 00:39:53.788
different sectors,
different economies,

902
00:39:53.788 --> 00:39:54.788
in certain areas,
in

903
00:39:54.788 --> 00:39:55.997
different parts of the country.

904
00:39:55.997 --> 00:40:00.955
Hummza.

905
00:40:02.288 --> 00:40:07.205
Hi, so to add to Seema’s point
about thejob Support Scheme,

906
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.747
Rishi Sunak also said that
Universal Credit was there

907
00:40:09.747 --> 00:40:12.372
for those whose wages have dropped
and he also proposed cuts

908
00:40:12.372 --> 00:40:14.580
to Universal Credit,
so this is going to cause

909
00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:19.580
the 6 million households £1000
a year and the bottom fifth,

910
00:40:21.997 --> 00:40:23.747
they’re losing 7% of
their disposable income.

911
00:40:23.747 --> 00:40:26.330
I think that this is terrible
economics, because he has taken

912
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.497
£6 billion out of the economy
and that is of a £6 billion

913
00:40:29.497 --> 00:40:31.413
less cash being spent
in a consumer—driven economy,

914
00:40:31.413 --> 00:40:33.788
so he is reducing incomes
for the hassles that actually

915
00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:38.580
have to spend the money,
but as usual, the poorer

916
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.747
—— poor are are paying
the cost of it.

917
00:40:40.747 --> 00:40:43.663
Kate, we have arranged quite far
and wide in this particular debate

918
00:40:43.663 --> 00:40:46.747
and I am just going to bring
you back to the original question,

919
00:40:46.747 --> 00:40:49.663
asked by Martin, when is a cafe
a restaurant and a restaurant

920
00:40:49.663 --> 00:40:50.663
a bar?

921
00:40:50.663 --> 00:40:53.788
There has also been a lot of talk
about that here in Scotland,

922
00:40:53.788 --> 00:40:56.455
as to what cafes can operate,
given that restaurants are shut,

923
00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:57.455
apart from for takeaway.

924
00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.622
Does it differ in Edinburgh,
Cardiff, Belfast or London?

925
00:40:59.622 --> 00:41:02.538
Do you think there should be one
rule across the United Kingdom?

926
00:41:02.538 --> 00:41:04.997
So, no, for two reasons.

927
00:41:04.997 --> 00:41:08.080
I also think that we want to take
a four nations approach as

928
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.497
much as possible, so clarity
of messaging is critically important

929
00:41:10.497 --> 00:41:12.705
when dealing with this virus.

930
00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:15.788
However, the simpler the message,
often the harsher it is.

931
00:41:15.788 --> 00:41:17.872
So, if you look at
Scotland for example, I

932
00:41:17.872 --> 00:41:19.788
represent the Highlands,
which has a different rate

933
00:41:19.788 --> 00:41:21.955
of infection than some parts
of the central belt.

934
00:41:21.955 --> 00:41:23.705
We have taken action
to have stricter

935
00:41:23.705 --> 00:41:25.372
restrictions in some
parts of the central

936
00:41:25.372 --> 00:41:26.788
belt than we do in
the

937
00:41:26.788 --> 00:41:29.205
Highlands, because it does lead
to greater compliance, people can

938
00:41:29.205 --> 00:41:34.205
understand what is going on and
there is clearly higher rates there.

939
00:41:34.497 --> 00:41:36.413
Now, that will mean
a slight variation in

940
00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:37.455
what those restrictions are.

941
00:41:37.455 --> 00:41:39.830
The second point, though,
as to why we need different

942
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.788
restrictions is because we are
managing multiple harms.

943
00:41:41.788 --> 00:41:46.747
Now, I don’t have, in
the Scottish Government, the fiscal

944
00:41:47.413 --> 00:41:50.497
levers — I’ve asked for them,
multiple times — I don’t have the

945
00:41:50.497 --> 00:41:52.872
fiscal levers or the financial
resources, because we are not

946
00:41:52.872 --> 00:41:54.580
allowed to borrow to properly
compensate employers.

947
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.205
Now, we are coming,
as you said, to what is a

948
00:41:57.205 --> 00:41:59.372
cliff edge, because there
is no way around it,

949
00:41:59.372 --> 00:42:00.580
the job Support Scheme
is

950
00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.955
not a replacement for the furlough
scheme, itjust incentivises

951
00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:04.663
employers, we know
from our own analysis

952
00:42:04.663 --> 00:42:06.330
it is going to cost tens
of

953
00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.955
thousands of Scottish
jobs, which will be

954
00:42:07.955 --> 00:42:09.038
exacerbated right across
the

955
00:42:09.038 --> 00:42:13.997
United Kingdom, and ultimately
employers need support.

956
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.288
AsJim said earlier,
hospitality has been

957
00:42:17.288 --> 00:42:19.705
through the most challenging
of times, businesses up and down

958
00:42:19.705 --> 00:42:24.038
the country have made
enormous sacrifices,

959
00:42:24.038 --> 00:42:26.747
have invested, but right now,
with less resources and the prospect

960
00:42:26.747 --> 00:42:30.330
of a cliff edge with furlough coming
to an end, they are having to make

961
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.205
very difficult choices and for me
to the UK Government is that,

962
00:42:33.205 --> 00:42:35.122
if there are going to be
these restrictions,

963
00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:37.955
if we manage the health harms
as well as the Covid harms

964
00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:40.663
and with our primary objective right
now of suppressing the virus,

965
00:42:40.663 --> 00:42:42.788
because actually suppressing
the virus is the fastest way

966
00:42:42.788 --> 00:42:44.955
of getting back to some form
of normality, economically

967
00:42:44.955 --> 00:42:47.788
or socially, if we can suppress
the virus, then we can restart,

968
00:42:47.788 --> 00:42:50.247
but when it comes to financial
support and Douglas mentioned

969
00:42:50.247 --> 00:42:52.872
a short while ago about business
support in this break period

970
00:42:52.872 --> 00:42:56.205
that we have got, a two week period,
one of the challenges was waiting

971
00:42:56.205 --> 00:42:58.372
for the Chancellor to make
an announcement last Friday

972
00:42:58.372 --> 00:43:00.997
on what they were going to do
in terms of additional

973
00:43:00.997 --> 00:43:03.872
financial support.

974
00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:08.872
That’s not fair, Kate.

975
00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:23.830
Because it’s one of our primary
sources for the Scottish Government,

976
00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.205
a primary source of funding,
that is the primary means

977
00:43:26.205 --> 00:43:28.622
by which we have to compensate
and mitigate the effects.

978
00:43:28.622 --> 00:43:30.288
Now, we largely work together
quite cooperatively,

979
00:43:30.288 --> 00:43:33.622
but I think it is ludicrous that
just as we are seeing the rate

980
00:43:33.622 --> 00:43:35.580
of infection increase
and the likelihood of restrictions,

981
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.955
greater restrictions,
we are seeing the end of what has

982
00:43:37.955 --> 00:43:40.830
been a lifeline and I accept,
I have been open and honest,

983
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.997
that it has been a lifeline
for many businesses.

984
00:43:42.997 --> 00:43:44.913
Now is not the time to end it.

985
00:43:44.913 --> 00:43:45.955
Everybody can see it.

986
00:43:45.955 --> 00:43:46.205
ﬂ

987
00:43:46.205 --> 00:43:48.788
I have been open and honest in
accepting it has been a lifeline to

988
00:43:48.788 --> 00:43:49.497
accepting it has been a lifeline to
many businesses.

989
00:43:49.497 --> 00:43:52.122
Every business the length
and breadth of the country can see

990
00:43:52.122 --> 00:43:55.247
it, but the Chancellor cannot appear
to see it, no matter how many

991
00:43:55.247 --> 00:43:56.705
times it is put to him.

992
00:43:56.705 --> 00:43:59.080
But, Kate, infairness,
you and the Labour Party welcomed,

993
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.788
when the Chancellor announced
the replacement furlough,

994
00:44:00.788 --> 00:44:03.913
you both welcomed it at the time
and you said it was right

995
00:44:03.913 --> 00:44:06.288
that there was a replacement,
there was no cliff edge,

996
00:44:06.288 --> 00:44:08.913
but say you were waiting
for the Chancellor to outline any

997
00:44:08.913 --> 00:44:11.830
further support that you could give,
the Chancellor has now said Scotland

998
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:12.997
will get £700 million more.

999
00:44:12.997 --> 00:44:14.913
On Friday, and I was
thankfulfor it.

1000
00:44:14.913 --> 00:44:16.830
Why then today did Nicola
Sturgeon announced that

1001
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.747
it would stilljust be £40 million
going to the businesses affected?

1002
00:44:19.747 --> 00:44:21.413
£40 million that will
not be available...

1003
00:44:21.413 --> 00:44:23.330
You do appreciate that
that is for health?

1004
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.247
It is for health,
not just for business

1005
00:44:25.247 --> 00:44:26.288
support.

1006
00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:27.372
Kate, it’s not!

1007
00:44:27.372 --> 00:44:29.497
It is for the £3000
grants that the UK

1008
00:44:29.497 --> 00:44:31.205
Government are giving
to businesses in England

1009
00:44:31.205 --> 00:44:32.372
that you could give
to

1010
00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:33.413
businesses in Scotland.

1011
00:44:33.413 --> 00:44:35.580
They are waiting right
now, they have had to

1012
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:40.580
wait ten days, sorry, cake,
if I canjust finish,

1013
00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:45.372
—— sorry, Kate, because this
is really important

1014
00:44:45.372 --> 00:44:46.580
to the businesses that
are

1015
00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.663
watching this, because I spoke
to them on Monday, I had a virtual

1016
00:44:49.663 --> 00:44:52.038
summit with businesses
and they are crying out for help

1017
00:44:52.038 --> 00:44:54.705
and crying out for help now,
so give them that £700

1018
00:44:54.705 --> 00:44:56.830
million you got from
the Chancellor or give them...

1019
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.038
Kate, Kate, give them some...

1020
00:44:58.038 --> 00:44:59.747
It is based on an absurd position.

1021
00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:02.122
Give them some of the £250
million that you haven’t

1022
00:45:02.122 --> 00:45:03.580
spent through the
Scottish growth fund.

1023
00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.622
That is an inaccuracy.

1024
00:45:04.622 --> 00:45:05.663
Why not spend that...

1025
00:45:05.663 --> 00:45:08.788
Hang on, if you both talk
at the same time, no one can

1026
00:45:08.788 --> 00:45:09.788
hear.

1027
00:45:09.788 --> 00:45:14.080
Let’s let Kate answer.

1028
00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.663
There are two points I would make,
one, small grants of one and a half

1029
00:45:17.663 --> 00:45:20.288
thousand pounds is no replacement
for the furlough scheme, that is

1030
00:45:20.288 --> 00:45:21.372
point number one.

1031
00:45:21.372 --> 00:45:23.538
Point number two is that
that £700 million, worth

1032
00:45:23.538 --> 00:45:25.205
asking the Chancellor,
that does notjust

1033
00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:26.413
cover business support,
that is

1034
00:45:26.413 --> 00:45:29.538
for health, that is for transport
and a whole host of other things,

1035
00:45:29.538 --> 00:45:30.538
just for clarity.

1036
00:45:30.538 --> 00:45:32.955
The third point is that
the business support that we

1037
00:45:32.955 --> 00:45:35.830
have put in place is more generous
than the UK Government support.

1038
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:36.872
It is.

1039
00:45:36.872 --> 00:45:37.955
The facts are there.

1040
00:45:37.955 --> 00:45:38.955
It is not.

1041
00:45:38.955 --> 00:45:42.788
At the moment, and the rest of
the UK, if you are obliged by law to

1042
00:45:42.788 --> 00:45:46.205
close, you will get a grant and all
the businesses in the supply chain

1043
00:45:46.205 --> 00:45:48.788
will not get funding and other
businesses that are not directly

1044
00:45:48.788 --> 00:45:49.997
impacted will not get funding.

1045
00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:52.205
In Scotland, we have provided
funding for the businesses

1046
00:45:52.205 --> 00:45:54.372
required to close by law,
but also the businesses

1047
00:45:54.372 --> 00:45:56.788
in the supply chain
and the businesses which might see

1048
00:45:56.788 --> 00:45:59.122
reduced trading, but are not
required to close by law.

1049
00:45:59.122 --> 00:46:01.038
I think that is the
breadth of support

1050
00:46:01.038 --> 00:46:06.080
that we need to see,
but let us not kid ourselves,

1051
00:46:18.913 --> 00:46:21.330
£1,500 of grant, important as it
is, is no replacement

1052
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.330
for the furlough scheme.

1053
00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:27.372
OK, I’m going to take another
question, but before I

1054
00:46:28.788 --> 00:46:31.205
I’m going to take another question
now from Colin Campbell.

1055
00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:32.247
Thank you, Fiona.

1056
00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:34.413
A recent poll shows
that the Scottish issue of

1057
00:46:34.413 --> 00:46:36.330
independence has a huge
majority of 58% support.

1058
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.705
How long can the UK Government
continued to deny the

1059
00:46:38.705 --> 00:46:41.330
Scottish people the right
to have their say on the future?

1060
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:42.997
Now, Douglas, you have
said before that

1061
00:46:42.997 --> 00:46:45.663
London is in part responsible
for the support for independence in

1062
00:46:45.663 --> 00:46:46.747
Scotland.

1063
00:46:46.747 --> 00:46:48.372
Do you want to expand on that?

1064
00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.288
Well, just to answer
the question, I don’t

1065
00:46:50.288 --> 00:46:51.497
downplay the challenge
that we

1066
00:46:51.497 --> 00:46:54.372
face, people in Scotland like me,
who believe in the Union, who

1067
00:46:54.372 --> 00:46:56.038
believe in Scotland’s
proud place as part

1068
00:46:56.038 --> 00:46:57.497
of the four nations
of the

1069
00:46:57.497 --> 00:47:00.122
United Kingdom, but I also don’t
believe there is anything inevitable

1070
00:47:00.122 --> 00:47:02.788
about this, despite what the SNP
representatives might say on this

1071
00:47:02.788 --> 00:47:04.497
panel, because I think
Scotland’s best days

1072
00:47:04.497 --> 00:47:05.747
and proudest days are
when

1073
00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:08.830
we stand together as part of a union
that we helped to build.

1074
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.247
But I also look at this
from a very personal

1075
00:47:11.247 --> 00:47:16.205
point of view, I have a wee
18—month—old son, Alistair, he is

1076
00:47:16.288 --> 00:47:21.330
sound asleep in Murray
right now back home,

1077
00:47:23.913 --> 00:47:27.247
and I look at him and when I see
these polls, I don’t get

1078
00:47:27.247 --> 00:47:28.455
downhearted, I get even more

1079
00:47:28.455 --> 00:47:31.080
determined than ever before,
to ensure that when he grows up,

1080
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.497
he ran be as proud of Scotland,
as part of

1081
00:47:33.497 --> 00:47:37.330
it as me, but he can also grow up
in the United Kingdom, rather than a

1082
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:38.330
divided Scotland.

1083
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.580
That is what I want.

1084
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.663
So, yeah, we have got to look
at these polls, we take it

1085
00:47:42.663 --> 00:47:45.080
seriously, but those of us
who believe in the union,

1086
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.497
who will fight for the union,
have to work harder

1087
00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.163
and better than ever
before, to promote

1088
00:47:49.163 --> 00:47:50.330
what Scotland gets from
the

1089
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:52.247
Union and what Scotland
gives to the union.

1090
00:47:52.247 --> 00:47:54.413
And how much responsibility do
you think the Westminster

1091
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:57.080
government has to play
in the support for the union here?

1092
00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.247
I have said in my speech
to party members...

1093
00:47:59.247 --> 00:48:01.663
For independence, sorry,
I said union, of course I meant

1094
00:48:01.663 --> 00:48:02.705
independence.

1095
00:48:02.705 --> 00:48:07.622
I knew where you are going, Fiona.

1096
00:48:07.622 --> 00:48:10.455
I said to party members,
you know, we need to do far

1097
00:48:10.455 --> 00:48:13.830
more and all of us do,
all of us who believe in the union

1098
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.205
have to work far harder to promote
that case for

1099
00:48:16.205 --> 00:48:17.705
what Scotland gets from the union.

1100
00:48:17.705 --> 00:48:19.830
Have you spoken to the
Prime Minister about it?

1101
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.455
Yes, yes, I have, I have spoken
to the Prime Minister,

1102
00:48:22.455 --> 00:48:25.163
I have spoken to MP5,
I have spoken to previous MPs

1103
00:48:25.163 --> 00:48:27.038
and previous prime ministers or not
prime ministers,

1104
00:48:27.038 --> 00:48:29.705
but politicians, from just, that
voted for the established and since

1105
00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:32.538
devolution was established in 1999,
there has been a feeling, in London,

1106
00:48:32.538 --> 00:48:34.955
by successive UK governments that
only aids the nationalist cause.

1107
00:48:34.955 --> 00:48:37.122
But for me there are
so many things to

1108
00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:40.205
be passionate about for the union,
what we should be fighting for and

1109
00:48:40.205 --> 00:48:43.122
that argument is as strong today
as it was six years ago

1110
00:48:43.122 --> 00:48:44.788
when we had our referendum in 2014.

1111
00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:45.830
Miriam.

1112
00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:47.997
Yes, I think the first
point to make here

1113
00:48:47.997 --> 00:48:50.163
is that the campaign for
independence hasn’t actually started

1114
00:48:50.163 --> 00:48:51.205
yet.

1115
00:48:51.205 --> 00:48:54.080
I would argue that Westminster
isjust making the campaign in and

1116
00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.955
of itself, it is increasing appetite
for independence, just by virtue of

1117
00:48:56.955 --> 00:49:00.330
the actions it has taken and I am
not surprised to see a growing

1118
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:03.205
appetite for independence, I think
we have had a multitude of factors

1119
00:49:03.205 --> 00:49:05.580
and I don’t think there
is any one single factor

1120
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.622
that has increased
the

1121
00:49:06.622 --> 00:49:07.705
support for independence.

1122
00:49:07.705 --> 00:49:09.622
I think there have
been a multitude of

1123
00:49:09.622 --> 00:49:10.705
things.

1124
00:49:10.705 --> 00:49:15.663
You know, I think it is important
to bear in mind where we

1125
00:49:16.455 --> 00:49:19.622
were prior to this, we had faced
a decade of austerity from a

1126
00:49:19.622 --> 00:49:22.747
government we did not vote for,
we saw a Brexit vote pushed through

1127
00:49:22.747 --> 00:49:24.372
from another government
we didn’t vote for,,

1128
00:49:24.372 --> 00:49:26.288
backed by billionaire financiers
and when Scotland voted

1129
00:49:26.288 --> 00:49:31.330
Remain, it didn’t make
an ounce of difference.

1130
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.205
Now, we see the pushing
through of the Internal Market Bill,

1131
00:49:36.205 --> 00:49:39.080
which I think, and you know,
to quote Mark Drakeford, the Welsh

1132
00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.747
First Minister, that this is
an enormous power grab, we are seen

1133
00:49:42.747 --> 00:49:45.080
a shoring up, a concentration
of power is in Westminster,

1134
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.163
from devolved

1135
00:49:46.163 --> 00:49:50.747
measures and that matters most now,
because what that does it set the

1136
00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:55.788
standards going forward
for goods and services.

1137
00:49:55.788 --> 00:50:00.788
Now, that is important,
because we are heading

1138
00:50:05.163 --> 00:50:08.788
into trade deals and I’d argue
that it is not going to be the UK

1139
00:50:08.788 --> 00:50:10.663
Government that are going
to set the standards,

1140
00:50:10.663 --> 00:50:11.788
it is probably going
to

1141
00:50:11.788 --> 00:50:13.955
be the US and whoever
our future trade deals

1142
00:50:13.955 --> 00:50:15.247
are with and frankly,
we

1143
00:50:15.247 --> 00:50:18.830
are going to see a race
to the bottom and I think it is very

1144
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.747
imminently clear that areas
like our NHS will be on the table.

1145
00:50:21.747 --> 00:50:23.372
We have already seen
concerns from farmers

1146
00:50:23.372 --> 00:50:25.788
and we have already seen concerns
from environmental campaigners and

1147
00:50:25.788 --> 00:50:27.955
unions about what the prospects
of that might be.

1148
00:50:27.955 --> 00:50:30.122
Miriam, the UK Government have
always been at pains

1149
00:50:30.122 --> 00:50:32.538
to say the NHS will
not be on the table.

1150
00:50:32.538 --> 00:50:35.122
The UK Government also voted
against, if I am correct in

1151
00:50:35.122 --> 00:50:37.330
remembering here, voted
against an amendment to the trade

1152
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:38.997
bill to protect the NHS
against foreign

1153
00:50:38.997 --> 00:50:41.163
interference, to protect wages,
did you vote against that?

1154
00:50:41.163 --> 00:50:42.788
It is absolutely
categorical that the NHS

1155
00:50:42.788 --> 00:50:44.997
is not up for sale
in these trade deals.

1156
00:50:44.997 --> 00:50:46.955
I would like to hear
from the audience.

1157
00:50:46.955 --> 00:50:49.663
You have delighted us
long enough, Douglas.

1158
00:50:49.663 --> 00:50:51.413
Kate McLaren.

1159
00:50:51.413 --> 00:50:56.372
Thanks, Fiona.

1160
00:50:59.288 --> 00:51:01.788
I am just wondering,
having been through the previous

1161
00:51:01.788 --> 00:51:03.913
independence referendum, and then
the chaotic fallout of praxis,

1162
00:51:03.913 --> 00:51:06.788
whether you voted Remain or Leave,
when people will start to realise

1163
00:51:06.788 --> 00:51:09.163
that referendums are not the right
way to decide anything?

1164
00:51:09.163 --> 00:51:11.080
Susan Lingen, I will
come to a minute,

1165
00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.997
first of all let me hear from Susan.

1166
00:51:12.997 --> 00:51:15.913
I would like to know who’s
requesting all opinion polls at the

1167
00:51:15.913 --> 00:51:16.913
moment.

1168
00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:20.663
The UK is currently facing
an economic and a health crisis, of

1169
00:51:20.663 --> 00:51:25.497
epic proportions, and surely
constitutional questions are just a

1170
00:51:25.497 --> 00:51:27.122
complete irrelevance at the moment?

1171
00:51:27.122 --> 00:51:30.247
Can we just focus on what really
matters right now, as one United

1172
00:51:30.247 --> 00:51:31.288
Kingdom?

1173
00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:33.788
Ian.

1174
00:51:33.788 --> 00:51:38.788
I think we had referendum
five years ago, it is an

1175
00:51:40.247 --> 00:51:42.413
important question, we should
absolutely not be addressing it

1176
00:51:42.413 --> 00:51:45.288
again.

1177
00:51:45.288 --> 00:51:49.747
What has gone completely wrong
in the last two or three years

1178
00:51:49.747 --> 00:51:52.622
is that we have got a Scottish
Government who generally are

1179
00:51:52.622 --> 00:51:56.663
adversarial and negative
about a whole range of things that

1180
00:51:56.663 --> 00:51:59.747
might happen with the UK
and Scotland

1181
00:51:59.747 --> 00:52:03.372
working together and
that we should be at.

1182
00:52:03.372 --> 00:52:07.163
We don’t have a devolved government
that is just looking

1183
00:52:07.163 --> 00:52:09.413
after Scotland at all,
we are a devolved government

1184
00:52:09.413 --> 00:52:14.372
who are focused on independence
and what we need is

1185
00:52:17.122 --> 00:52:19.288
a devolved government that
will work with UK Government.

1186
00:52:19.288 --> 00:52:21.913
You know, I have a list of six
different things here

1187
00:52:21.913 --> 00:52:24.788
which could happen, but right now
are being held back because frankly

1188
00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:27.705
the Scottish Government position
is they don’t really want to get any

1189
00:52:27.705 --> 00:52:30.622
big help from the UK Government,
because somehow it will cut across

1190
00:52:30.622 --> 00:52:31.622
the devolution rights.

1191
00:52:31.622 --> 00:52:33.788
The structure and the system
right now itjust

1192
00:52:33.788 --> 00:52:34.788
isn’t working.

1193
00:52:34.788 --> 00:52:37.497
If we could get that sorted out,
and honestly get both

1194
00:52:37.497 --> 00:52:40.455
governments working together
on a whole range of quite exciting

1195
00:52:40.455 --> 00:52:42.622
things that could be done,
then we would be

1196
00:52:42.622 --> 00:52:43.788
able to look ahead.

1197
00:52:43.788 --> 00:52:46.580
We are not.

1198
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.747
With great respect, the SNP have one
objective in mind and that is

1199
00:52:49.747 --> 00:52:51.413
independence.

1200
00:52:51.413 --> 00:52:54.080
Their actualjob is to look
after the Scottish people and

1201
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.997
to get the best deal
for the Scottish

1202
00:52:55.997 --> 00:52:57.413
peopla and that is not
the

1203
00:52:57.413 --> 00:52:58.497
top priority right now.

1204
00:52:58.497 --> 00:53:00.413
Kate.

1205
00:53:00.413 --> 00:53:02.038
I fundamentally
disagree with that and

1206
00:53:02.038 --> 00:53:04.705
I had an answer I talked
about the need to extend

1207
00:53:04.705 --> 00:53:09.705
the furlough scheme and welcoming it
when it was an

1208
00:53:13.747 --> 00:53:15.663
announced, clearly I do
have a very vested

1209
00:53:15.663 --> 00:53:16.788
interest in ensuring
that the

1210
00:53:16.788 --> 00:53:19.205
UK Government delivered for
Scotland, but actually on this, I

1211
00:53:19.205 --> 00:53:21.872
agree with Douglas Ross in his
maiden speech to the Conservative

1212
00:53:21.872 --> 00:53:24.497
Party conference a few weeks ago,
where he stated that his

1213
00:53:24.497 --> 00:53:27.413
Conservative, and that I think
is the bottom line and that is

1214
00:53:27.413 --> 00:53:29.788
precisely why we are seeing
an increase in the polls.

1215
00:53:29.788 --> 00:53:31.747
Now, the polls arejust
indicative of public

1216
00:53:31.747 --> 00:53:34.122
opinion, but we had the ninth
consecutive pole showing the

1217
00:53:34.122 --> 00:53:35.288
majority of support
for independence.

1218
00:53:35.288 --> 00:53:37.747
Do you think the falling
out that there has been

1219
00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.663
between Nicola Sturgeon
and Alex Salmond has been

1220
00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:40.705
helpful in that regard?

1221
00:53:40.705 --> 00:53:43.288
Well, I think more people
are interested right now in ensuring

1222
00:53:43.288 --> 00:53:46.205
the businesses get support and that
we suppress the virus and also

1223
00:53:46.205 --> 00:53:48.372
making decisions about their
long—term future, because they can

1224
00:53:48.372 --> 00:53:51.205
see, certainly the polls prove this
point, they can see that Scotland’s

1225
00:53:51.205 --> 00:53:53.122
best interests are preserved
by a Scottish Government.

1226
00:53:53.122 --> 00:53:55.997
The question for me
is what is the democratic

1227
00:53:55.997 --> 00:54:00.413
route to delivering that?

1228
00:54:00.413 --> 00:54:02.830
That is a question that
I would pose to the

1229
00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:04.997
Conservatives, because certainly it
is unsustainable and undemocratic to

1230
00:54:04.997 --> 00:54:06.038
keep saying no.

1231
00:54:06.038 --> 00:54:08.205
We have got an increased,
a consistent increase in

1232
00:54:08.205 --> 00:54:10.122
the polls, we have got
another poll yesterday

1233
00:54:10.122 --> 00:54:11.288
saying that two thirds
of

1234
00:54:11.288 --> 00:54:13.205
people in Scotland think
that there should be

1235
00:54:13.205 --> 00:54:14.288
another referendum in
the

1236
00:54:14.288 --> 00:54:16.497
next five years.

1237
00:54:16.497 --> 00:54:19.372
What about Susan’s point,
with Brexit looming and what

1238
00:54:19.372 --> 00:54:22.747
that may bring, and with being in
the middle of a pandemic, that this

1239
00:54:22.747 --> 00:54:25.580
is something that should be put
on the back burner for now?

1240
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.705
And that is precisely why,
right now, certainly

1241
00:54:27.705 --> 00:54:30.122
from a Scottish Government
perspective, every minute of my day

1242
00:54:30.122 --> 00:54:32.913
is spent in dealing with the virus
and dealing with economic fallout

1243
00:54:32.913 --> 00:54:35.288
the virus.

1244
00:54:35.288 --> 00:54:37.955
But clearly there are going to be
questions, if you take

1245
00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:40.788
one question like economic recovery,
the last time we saw the UK

1246
00:54:40.788 --> 00:54:43.788
Government borrowing
to these levels was 2008,

1247
00:54:43.788 --> 00:54:45.163
in the aftermath of
the

1248
00:54:45.163 --> 00:54:47.247
financial crash.

1249
00:54:47.247 --> 00:54:52.205
Now that was followed...

1250
00:54:54.205 --> 00:54:54.372
BY

1251
00:54:54.372 --> 00:54:54.622
Bya

1252
00:54:54.622 --> 00:54:58.247
By a decade of Astarte were the
poorest in society paid for the

1253
00:54:58.247 --> 00:55:00.663
poorest in society paid for the
failures and as we come out of this

1254
00:55:00.663 --> 00:55:00.997
failures and as we come out of this
crisis, I

1255
00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:01.163
failures and as we come out of this
crisis, Iwant

1256
00:55:01.163 --> 00:55:03.497
failures and as we come out of this
crisis, I want to ensure that we are

1257
00:55:03.497 --> 00:55:04.663
crisis, I want to ensure that we are
investing in people, we are

1258
00:55:04.663 --> 00:55:05.538
investing in people, we are
investing in infrastructure and we

1259
00:55:05.538 --> 00:55:06.205
investing in infrastmclure and we
deal

1260
00:55:06.205 --> 00:55:10.413
investing in infrastructure and we
deal with our...

1261
00:55:10.413 --> 00:55:11.788
our public finances
in a fundamentally

1262
00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:12.830
different way.

1263
00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.788
That will require financial
powers, fiscal powers to

1264
00:55:14.788 --> 00:55:16.163
be in the hands of the
Scottish Government, not...

1265
00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:20.580
I’m just going to get to the rest
of the panel because

1266
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:24.163
I am worried that we might then end
because we may run out of time.

1267
00:55:24.163 --> 00:55:27.080
Seema Malhotra, so the question is,
how long can the UK Government

1268
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.163
continue to deny the Scottish people
the right to have a say on

1269
00:55:30.163 --> 00:55:31.205
their future?

1270
00:55:31.205 --> 00:55:33.663
If Keir Starmer was Prime Minister,
would he give them

1271
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:34.705
that right?

1272
00:55:34.705 --> 00:55:37.788
Well, we have said that we will be
going in to the next

1273
00:55:37.788 --> 00:55:39.913
Scottish elections opposed
to a referendum and opposed to

1274
00:55:39.913 --> 00:55:43.538
independence and I think it comes
back to the point that we are in the

1275
00:55:43.538 --> 00:55:48.580
middle of a pandemic and itjust
is very surprising to me that Kate

1276
00:55:51.705 --> 00:55:53.830
talked about investment
and she talked about the polling

1277
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:58.872
data, but I am surprised she did not
mention,

1278
00:56:01.663 --> 00:56:04.247
for example, the child poverty
figures that are out today, which

1279
00:56:04.247 --> 00:56:06.413
show that child poverty
in Scotland is a 24%

1280
00:56:06.413 --> 00:56:07.663
and rising and rising
as

1281
00:56:07.663 --> 00:56:11.330
well in Nicola Sturgeon’s own
constituency and in Glasgow and I

1282
00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.538
think that we are missing the point
about what we should be really

1283
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:16.788
focused on.

1284
00:56:16.788 --> 00:56:21.788
People’s health, jobs,
the economy, education, children

1285
00:56:28.372 --> 00:56:31.455
this year who have seen a disrupted
education is not going to magically

1286
00:56:31.455 --> 00:56:34.622
correct itself next year and, look,
I just feel that the last thing

1287
00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:36.538
people are going to want,
is another divisive

1288
00:56:36.538 --> 00:56:37.538
referendum, when there
is

1289
00:56:37.538 --> 00:56:42.580
such important issues to focus on...

1290
00:56:43.205 --> 00:56:48.080
To rebuild our health system with
our NHS still under strain, with...

1291
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.247
A lot more to come,
our economy, withjobs

1292
00:56:50.247 --> 00:56:51.288
possibly not back,
as

1293
00:56:51.288 --> 00:56:55.872
they...

1294
00:56:55.872 --> 00:56:57.247
With education, retraining and older

1295
00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:59.122
with education, retraining and older
peopla...

1296
00:56:59.122 --> 00:57:00.705
Losing theirjobs and catching up

1297
00:57:00.705 --> 00:57:02.038
with younger people.

1298
00:57:02.038 --> 00:57:03.955
I think that these
are the really critical

1299
00:57:03.955 --> 00:57:05.455
issues and that is why
the

1300
00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:08.288
Scottish Labour Party has been
focusing on these issues and that is

1301
00:57:08.288 --> 00:57:11.705
what they will want to be talking
about, because this is where so much

1302
00:57:11.705 --> 00:57:13.372
of the polling also
shows that people’s

1303
00:57:13.372 --> 00:57:14.413
priorities are across
the

1304
00:57:14.413 --> 00:57:17.288
United Kingdom and I will make this
final point, people in my

1305
00:57:17.288 --> 00:57:19.705
constituency, myself, many others,
across the Kingdom have got friends

1306
00:57:19.705 --> 00:57:22.330
and family in Scotland and we
remember how divisive the last

1307
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:25.747
referendum was.

1308
00:57:25.747 --> 00:57:27.913
Then we saw the Brexit
referendum, with all the

1309
00:57:27.913 --> 00:57:29.205
division that that brought.

1310
00:57:29.205 --> 00:57:31.663
I think people want
a period of healing,

1311
00:57:31.663 --> 00:57:34.038
they want the country,
the whole country to be working

1312
00:57:34.038 --> 00:57:38.288
together and that is certainly
were Keir Starmer

1313
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:40.163
is focused, because if
he is Prime Minister,

1314
00:57:40.163 --> 00:57:41.830
as I hope he will he,
he

1315
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.247
wants to be Prime Minister of the
whole of the United Kingdom and I

1316
00:57:45.247 --> 00:57:48.080
think that that is how we will
tackle these major issues, like

1317
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.788
child poverty, like aspiration and
like prosperity to make sure that

1318
00:57:50.788 --> 00:57:54.080
that reaches all
parts of our nation.

1319
00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.163
Thank you.

1320
00:57:55.163 --> 00:57:56.663
Mark, you wanted to come in.

1321
00:57:56.663 --> 00:57:58.205
Yes.

1322
00:57:58.205 --> 00:58:00.872
My father, who will be 102
weeks’ time was born in

1323
00:58:00.872 --> 00:58:05.830
Glasgow, my mother in London.

1324
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.247
My wife’s family came from Aberdeen,
Edinburgh, Manchester and

1325
00:58:08.247 --> 00:58:09.747
the south of England.

1326
00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:11.538
I worked in health
service where people came

1327
00:58:11.538 --> 00:58:14.705
from all over the country
and indeed, all of the world and the

1328
00:58:14.705 --> 00:58:17.788
great science that has been done
in the UK again, again, it’s very

1329
00:58:17.788 --> 00:58:19.747
international, and I think
my answer is obvious.

1330
00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:20.788
I think it is.

1331
00:58:20.788 --> 00:58:22.455
I think we know where you stand.

1332
00:58:22.455 --> 00:58:23.872
There are a few hands up.

1333
00:58:23.872 --> 00:58:26.538
We have got very little time
left, we just want to

1334
00:58:26.538 --> 00:58:28.705
get round afield
of view, if we can.

1335
00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:29.747
Lucas.

1336
00:58:29.747 --> 00:58:32.788
So, I am coming from a place
of growing up in England and

1337
00:58:32.788 --> 00:58:35.747
coming to a Scottish university,
I was originally very proud of the

1338
00:58:35.747 --> 00:58:36.788
Union.

1339
00:58:36.788 --> 00:58:39.372
But then seemingly all my Scottish
friends that I have made

1340
00:58:39.372 --> 00:58:41.080
here at uni are all
pro independence.

1341
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.955
On the point made that it is
important that we look for

1342
00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:45.788
health, healing and
ambition and prosperity,

1343
00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:47.497
seemingly what most
of

1344
00:58:47.497 --> 00:58:49.997
my friends say is that the
opportunities for Scotland outside

1345
00:58:49.997 --> 00:58:51.747
of the United Kingdom,
potentially being back

1346
00:58:51.747 --> 00:58:54.872
in the European Union
or

1347
00:58:54.872 --> 00:58:57.038
making their own way
as the UK and Britain

1348
00:58:57.038 --> 00:58:58.455
have said, we are going
to

1349
00:58:58.455 --> 00:59:01.580
ourselves, those opportunities
are so much greater

1350
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:06.580
than if we are stuck
here in the United Kingdom and being

1351
00:59:06.788 --> 00:59:08.705
consistently held back
by Westminster, that continues to

1352
00:59:08.705 --> 00:59:13.747
prioritise London over
any other part of the UK.

1353
00:59:25.122 --> 00:59:27.538
Tonight are questions came
from Edinburgh, as we can see,

1354
00:59:27.538 --> 00:59:29.705
and next week we will be joined
by our

1355
00:59:29.705 --> 00:59:31.622
audience in Sedgefield, alongside
Nobel prize—winning economistjoseph

1356
00:59:31.622 --> 00:59:33.538
stiglitz, so that should
be quite a programme.

1357
00:59:33.538 --> 00:59:36.163
The week after that, our audience
comes from Lincoln, so do

1358
00:59:36.163 --> 00:59:38.830
please get in touch
if you are from either of those

1359
00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:40.955
areas and you want to
be on the programme.

1360
00:59:40.955 --> 00:59:43.122
You can go to the Question
Time website and

1361
00:59:43.122 --> 00:59:44.163
follow the instructions there.

1362
00:59:44.163 --> 00:59:47.038

1364
00:59:48.122 --> 00:59:51.205
That is just about to start
and you can see on the screen

1365
00:59:51.205 --> 00:59:52.872
how to get in touch with them.

1366
00:59:52.872 --> 00:59:55.288
Thank you very much to the panel
for coming tonight.

1367
00:59:55.288 --> 00:59:57.705
Mark and Seema, thank
you very much for doing your

1368
00:59:57.705 --> 01:00:01.038

of the debate and, of course, to our

Kym. Time to get a team together.

1377
01:00:41.622 --> 01:00:42.705
Hi, Kym.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:45.122
Hey. Gethin? I’m on my way.

I hope they turn up!

1385
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.997
# Now I beg to see you dance
just one more time

1386
01:01:05.372 --> 01:01:08.372
# So dance for me, dance for me,
dance for me, oh—oh

1387
01:01:09.372 --> 01:01:12.372
# When you’re done,
I’ll make you do it all again... #

1388
01:01:12.372 --> 01:01:14.622
It’s what we’ve all been
waiting for.

1389
01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:16.330
Strictly, the brand—new series:

1390
01:01:51.163 --> 01:01:54.538
There is so much news today, this
is going to be a bumper Newscast.

1391
01:01:54.538 --> 01:01:57.705
It’s going to be like one of those
Christmas selection boxes where it’s

1392
01:01:57.705 --> 01:01:58.747
got everything in it.

1393
01:01:58.747 --> 01:02:01.080
Everything in it, and everything
that you like talking about?

1394
01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.497
Well, like talking about, but not
necessarily like the subjects,

1395
01:02:03.497 --> 01:02:05.413
but anyway you can see
where I’m going.

1396
01:02:05.413 --> 01:02:06.455
I see.

1397
01:02:06.455 --> 01:02:10.455
So, anyway, you’re going to have me,
Kuenssberg, Mason...

1398
01:02:10.455 --> 01:02:11.497
LAURA GASPS

1399
01:02:11.497 --> 01:02:13.997
..the return
of Katya Adler.

1400
01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:15.497
Hooray!
Who is in Brussels.

1401
01:02:15.497 --> 01:02:18.413
And, if that wasn’t enough variety,
we are then going to have

1402
01:02:18.413 --> 01:02:21.038
Fergus Walsh, and we are going to be
in conversation with

1403
01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:22.038
a member of Sage.

1404
01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:24.455
That’s definitely 3 Fruit & Nut,
3 Twix, a Snickers,

1405
01:02:24.455 --> 01:02:26.413
a Classic Dairy Milk,
and 3 Mars bar.

1406
01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:28.288
With, like, a Bounty
in there as well.

1407
01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:31.247
Galaxy?
Curly Wurly?

1408
01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.497
Let’s just all list chocolates.

1409
01:02:32.497 --> 01:02:34.413
That’s actually what we’re
going to do instead!

1410
01:02:34.413 --> 01:02:38.413
That would be true to form.

1411
01:02:38.413 --> 01:02:41.038
So all of that to look
forward to on this bumper

1412
01:02:41.038 --> 01:02:46.080
selection box of Newscast.

1413
01:02:52.663 --> 01:02:54.080
Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

1414
01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.497
And Laura in the same studio —
two metres apart.

1415
01:02:56.497 --> 01:02:59.080
And Chris, about 20 metres down
the corridor in my socially

1416
01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.955
distant layer of news.

1417
01:03:00.955 --> 01:03:03.872
And Katya, quite a lot further away,
but close in my heart.

1418
01:03:03.872 --> 01:03:05.788
Unfortunately, for you,
Katya, it’s going to be

1419
01:03:05.788 --> 01:03:07.955
slightly longer still,
because we got lots of coronavirus

1420
01:03:07.955 --> 01:03:12.497
to talk about before we get
to the view from Europe.

1421
01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:17.538
So are you 0K to sit tight
for a number of minutes?

1422
01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.163
Absolutely.

1423
01:03:22.163 --> 01:03:27.122
We’ll be back with you.

1424
01:03:30.747 --> 01:03:34.372
50 lots of news on that front today,
lots more areas being put into tier

1425
01:03:34.372 --> 01:03:35.580
two, the high alert level,

1426
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.747
with no more mixing indoors
between other households apart

1427
01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.372
from a few exceptions,
and the new areas in tier two,

1428
01:03:40.372 --> 01:03:42.288
as it’s called technically,
London, Essex, but not

1429
01:03:42.288 --> 01:03:47.288
Southend and Thurrock, York,
north—east Derbyshire,

1430
01:03:48.163 --> 01:03:50.330
Chesterfield, part of Derbyshire,
Elmbridge in Surrey and Barrow

1431
01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:51.413
in Furness in Cumbria.

1432
01:03:51.413 --> 01:03:53.788
And it means that about half
the population is now

1433
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.788
under extra restrictions.

1434
01:03:54.788 --> 01:03:55.788
Of England.
Of England.

1435
01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:57.997
Compared to where we
were a few days ago.

1436
01:03:57.997 --> 01:04:01.163
This will come in at midnight
on Friday, so when we wake up

1437
01:04:01.163 --> 01:04:03.955
Saturday morning we will be
in a different era, so in that

1438
01:04:03.955 --> 01:04:06.122
context it has been a very,
very big day.

1439
01:04:06.122 --> 01:04:08.038
A big step further towards tighter
restrictions everywhere.

1440
01:04:08.038 --> 01:04:10.455
But, also, a big rise
in the political tensions.

1441
01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:11.872
Something been brewing all week.

1442
01:04:11.872 --> 01:04:14.580
We spoke about it earlier,
didn’t we, the clash between local

1443
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.413
and national leadership,
and more than anything else a big

1444
01:04:18.413 --> 01:04:23.455
north—south divide?

1445
01:04:28.372 --> 01:04:30.288
Here’s how that clash
has been playing out.

1446
01:04:30.288 --> 01:04:31.955
This is Matt Hancock
in Parliament today...

1447
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:34.622
The Liverpool City Region moved
into the very high level yesterday,

1448
01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:37.497
and I want to thank the local
leadership for their public service

1449
01:04:37.497 --> 01:04:39.663
and cross—party teamwork
in the face of this virus.

1450
01:04:39.663 --> 01:04:42.038
We’ve developed a substantial
package of support for areas that

1451
01:04:42.038 --> 01:04:44.205
enter this third tier,
and this includes more support

1452
01:04:44.205 --> 01:04:46.622
for local test and trace,
more funding for local enforcement

1453
01:04:46.622 --> 01:04:48.955
and theJob Support Scheme,
of course, alongside the offer

1454
01:04:48.955 --> 01:04:50.455
of help from the armed services.

1455
01:04:50.455 --> 01:04:55.038
Well, how’s that going
with the people who might be

1456
01:04:55.038 --> 01:04:56.413
put into Tier 3?

1457
01:04:56.413 --> 01:04:58.122
Here’s Andy Burnham,
Mayor of Greater Manchester.

1458
01:04:58.122 --> 01:05:00.788
He’s not happy...

1459
01:05:00.788 --> 01:05:03.413
They are willing to sacrifice jobs
and businesses here to try

1460
01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:05.122
save them elsewhere.

1461
01:05:05.122 --> 01:05:09.788
Greater Manchester,
the Liverpool City Region,

1462
01:05:09.788 --> 01:05:14.455
and Lancashire are being set up
as the canaries in the coal mine

1463
01:05:14.455 --> 01:05:16.663
for and experimental,
regional lockdown strategy
