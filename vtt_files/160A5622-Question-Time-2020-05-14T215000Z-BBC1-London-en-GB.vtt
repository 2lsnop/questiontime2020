at home, join the conversation on

42
00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:05.885
social media. The first question
Time is from Daniel Guest.

43
00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.052
I am starting a new key worker role
within the NHS next week.

44
00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:13.927
However, my only means to get there
is by utilising public transport.

45
00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:17.427
What can we do to ensure that key
workers who have no choice

46
00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:20.052
but to use public transport will be
protected both at work

47
00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:25.052
and on their commute?

48
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.344
Daniel, first of all,
congratulations on starting your new

49
00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:28.802
congratulations on starting your new
rola. Mick,

50
00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.469
congratulations on starting your new
role. Mick, as head of the RMT, let

51
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.885
rola. Mick, as head of the RMT, let
me start

52
00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:33.969
role. Mick, as head of the RMT, let
me start with you. Firstly, I think

53
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.885
me start with you. Firstly, I think
we should make sure key workers can

54
00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:36.135
we should make sure key workers ran
travel for

55
00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:40.010
we should make sure key workers can
travel for free on the networks.

56
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.219
travel for free on the networks.
Particularty

57
00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.677
travel for free on the networks.
Particularly NHS workers. They are

58
00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:42.260
Particularty NHS workers. They are
actually

59
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.885
Particularly NHS workers. They are
actually providing a hugely

60
00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:44.635
actually providing a hugely
important task and what we want to

61
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:47.177
important task and what we want to
make sure as a union and the rail

62
00:01:47.177 --> 00:01:48.469
make sure as a union and the rail
unions have been sitting down and

63
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.719
unions have been sitting down and
working with the rail industry to

64
00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.719
working with the rail industry to
make sure it is safe to travel on

65
00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.802
make sure it is safe to travel on
the network. And do you think it is

66
00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:55.010
the network. And do you think it is
at the moment because yellow from

67
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.719
at the moment because yellow from
some of the pictures I have seen in

68
00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.052
some of the pictures I have seen in
the last few days, no, with the

69
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.802
the last few days, no, with the
overcrowding and decongestion on

70
00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:03.135
overcrowding and decongestion on
platforms and trains. No, we had a

71
00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:07.510
platforms and trains. No, we had a
plan as an industry, that the

72
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.635
plan as an industry, that the
government threw into disarray when

73
00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:12.094
government threw into disarray when
they decided to release lockdown so

74
00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:13.260
they decided to release lockdown so
we got more people using the

75
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.469
we got more peopla using the
railways

76
00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.510
we got more people using the
railways than we had planned for

77
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.969
railways than we had planned for
which is putting everybody who

78
00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.510
which is putting everybody who
should, predominantly key workers,

79
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.719
should, predominantly key workers,
at risk of travelling because of the

80
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.885
at risk of travelling because of the
overcrowding particularly at peak

81
00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:23.052
overcrowding particularty at peak
times.

82
00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:24.885
overcrowding particularly at peak
times. We want to make sure we have

83
00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:26.094
times. We want to make sure we have
a regular service, they are

84
00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:27.385
a regular service, they are
increasing the amount of trains next

85
00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:29.677
increasing the amount of trains next
week so that should make it safer.

86
00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:31.260
week so that should make it safer.
If you have more trains running with

87
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.302
If you have more trains mnning with
fewer people.

88
00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:33.844
If you have more trains running with
fewer people, you have the ability

89
00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:35.052
fewer people, you have the ability
to have social distancing and keep

90
00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:37.344
to have social distancing and keep
safe and we want to make sure that

91
00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:37.760
safe and we want to make sure that
peopla feel

92
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.302
safe and we want to make sure that
people feel safe and can travel to

93
00:02:41.302 --> 00:02:41.677
peopla feel safe and ran travel to
and from

94
00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:43.927
people feel safe and can travel to
and from work. The rail network, the

95
00:02:43.927 --> 00:02:44.927
and from work. The rail network, the
bus network, has been operating

96
00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:48.094
bus network, has been operating
throughout this crisis and I think

97
00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:49.510
throughout this crisis and I think
we should praise all of those

98
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.844
we should praise all of those
workers who have been doing that

99
00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:54.635
workers who have been doing that
activity. One of the things I have

100
00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:56.052
activity. One of the things I have
learned from this particular crisis

101
00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:59.885
learned from this particular crisis
is the amount of people that

102
00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:00.219
is the amount of peopla that
actually

103
00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.469
is the amount of people that
actually ensure that we, as a

104
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.469
actually ensure that we, as a
society, ran

105
00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:04.885
actually ensure that we, as a
society, can run and operate,

106
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:05.385
society, ran nm and operate,
whether

107
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.760
society, can run and operate,
whether it’s NHS workers, care

108
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.885
whether it’s NHS workers, rare
walkers,

109
00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:08.552
whether it’s NHS workers, care
walkers, transport workers, shop

110
00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:09.844
walkers, transport workers, shop
workers, and they all need to have

111
00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:11.677
workers, and they all need to have
the opportunity to get to work

112
00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:12.510
the opportunity to get to work
safely. (“an I

113
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.844
the opportunity to get to work
safely. Can Ijust ask

114
00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:15.260
the opportunity to get to work
safely. Can I just ask you,

115
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.719
the opportunity to get to work
safely. Can Ijust ask you, it has

116
00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.052
safely. (“an Ijust ask you, it has
been reported

117
00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:16.885
safely. Can Ijust ask you, it has
been reported that he will recommend

118
00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:19.594
been reported that he will recommend
a strike if it is not made safe? No,

119
00:03:19.594 --> 00:03:21.885
a strike if it is not made safe? No,
what we have said, and we have got

120
00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:22.885
what we have said, and we have got
some real concerns about

121
00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:26.469
some real concerns about
overcrowding and the fact that you

122
00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.510
overcrowding and the fact that you
can’t have two metre social

123
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.635
can’t have two metre social
distancing on crowded trains. It is

124
00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:33.094
distancing on crowded trains. It is
not safe. So this talk of a strike

125
00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:33.552
not safe. So this talk of a strike
is... what

126
00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:35.177
not safe. So this talk of a strike
is... What we have said is that if

127
00:03:35.177 --> 00:03:35.552
is... what we have said is that if
the trains

128
00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:36.719
is... What we have said is that if
the trains are overcrowded and if

129
00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.260
the trains are overcrowded and if
our members are put at risk, we are

130
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.719
our members are put at risk, we are
saying to them, like any worker who

131
00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.510
saying to them, like any worker who
has a legal right, to protect

132
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.677
has a legal right, to protect
themselves, get to a place of safety

133
00:03:45.677 --> 00:03:47.677
themselves, get to a place of safety
and get out of harms way, because

134
00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:49.052
and get out of harms way, because
some of the things that we have

135
00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:50.844
some of the things that we have
seen, some of the messaging we have

136
00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:52.427
seen, some of the messaging we have
seen from the government, is

137
00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:53.385
seen from the government, is
encouraging people, whether they

138
00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:53.844
encouraging peopla, whether they
think it

139
00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:56.260
encouraging people, whether they
think it or not, to get on trains,

140
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
think it or not, to get on trains,
make platforms and trains and buses

141
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.844
make platforms and trains and buses
crowded and they are putting the

142
00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:01.885
crowded and they are putting the
workers at risk so we are saying,

143
00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:04.510
workers at risk so we are saying,
"No, if you are faced with that,

144
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.219
"No, if you are faced with that,
step back", but that could mean in

145
00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.260
step back", but that could mean in
certain circumstances trains have to

146
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.802
certain circumstances trains have to
be stopped. Luke? My wife works in

147
00:04:13.802 --> 00:04:15.719
be stopped. Luke? My wife works in
the NHS every day at a hospital that

148
00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.927
the NHS every day at a hospital that
has Covid patience and she is

149
00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:20.094
has Covid patience and she is
wondering why, if she is having to

150
00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.510
wondering why, if she is having to
do that, why rail workers, for

151
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.719
do that, why rail workers, for
example, who are, you know, the

152
00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.927
example, who are, you know, the
drivers are in their cabin, so why

153
00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:29.510
drivers are in their cabin, so why
are they more at risk than the

154
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.094
are they more at risk than the
health workers? It is not

155
00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:34.302
health workers? It is not
necessarily that they are more at

156
00:04:34.302 --> 00:04:35.719
necessarily that they are more at
risk, do you think they should be

157
00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.677
risk, do you think they should be
equally at risk? Well, I don’t know

158
00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:41.052
equally at risk? Well, I don’t know
what safe means. When people say

159
00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:41.635
what safe means. when peopla say
safe, do they

160
00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:42.302
what safe means. When people say
safe, do they mean absolutely safe

161
00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:47.635
safe, do they mean absolutely safe
in every possible way? Is two metres

162
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:48.219
in every possible way? Is two metres
social distancing scientifically

163
00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.802
social distancing scientifically
proven to keep us safe? I think all

164
00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:54.302
proven to keep us safe? I think all
of this obsession about being safe

165
00:04:54.302 --> 00:04:56.094
of this obsession about being safe
all the time is not realistic in a

166
00:04:56.094 --> 00:04:59.552
all the time is not realistic in a
busy city like London, is it? I have

167
00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:01.385
busy city like London, is it? I have
to say, I mean, you need to get your

168
00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.719
to say, I mean, you need to get your
facts right because you are 16 more

169
00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.344
facts right because you are 16 more
times likely to get coronavirus than

170
00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:07.802
times likely to get coronavirus than
die if you are a London bus worker

171
00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.969
die if you are a London bus worker
than an NHS worker, and there has

172
00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.677
than an NHS worker, and there has
been 28 bus workers in London, 42

173
00:05:13.677 --> 00:05:18.927
been 28 bus workers in London, 42
TfL workers have died in London,

174
00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:21.760
TfL workers have died in London,
there’s been ten rail workers, and a

175
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.802
there’s been ten rail workers, and a
British transport worker dying of

176
00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:24.927
British transport worker dying of
coronavirus that we know of. We know

177
00:05:24.927 --> 00:05:26.385
coronavirus that we know of. We know
there is a lot of underreporting in

178
00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:28.010
there is a lot of underreporting in
terms of the impact of the

179
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.260
terms of the impact of the
coronavirus. So how are people going

180
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.052
coronavirus. So how are peopla going
to get to work?

181
00:05:32.052 --> 00:05:32.927
coronavirus. So how are people going
to get to work? What we have planted

182
00:05:32.927 --> 00:05:33.344
to get to work? what we have planted
it and

183
00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:34.885
to get to work? What we have planted
it and look to do is make it as safe

184
00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:35.552
it and look to do is make it as safe
as possiblo and

185
00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:36.594
it and look to do is make it as safe
as possible and we did have a plan

186
00:05:36.594 --> 00:05:36.927
as possibla and we did have a plan
to do

187
00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:39.094
as possible and we did have a plan
to do that. We had a situation where

188
00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:40.510
to do that. We had a situation where
we have 50% of trains operating at

189
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.719
we have 5096 of trains operating at
this

190
00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.052
we have 50% of trains operating at
this moment in time the next week

191
00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:44.760
this moment in time the next week
that was going up to 70% and a

192
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.885
that was going up to 7096 and a
gradual

193
00:05:44.885 --> 00:05:45.719
that was going up to 70% and a
gradual increase that meant you

194
00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.635
gradual increase that meant you
could accommodate more and more

195
00:05:47.635 --> 00:05:49.510
could accommodate more and more
travelling to and from work which

196
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.052
travelling to and from work which
has been put under threat by the way

197
00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:52.802
has been put under threat by the way
the government have released a

198
00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.302
the government have released a
message about people getting on

199
00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:55.927
message about people getting on
trains. Let’s asked the government,

200
00:05:55.927 --> 00:05:56.594
trains. Let’s asked the government,
Mick (“ash says

201
00:05:56.594 --> 00:05:57.844
trains. Let’s asked the government,
Mick Cash says they had a plan but

202
00:05:57.844 --> 00:05:57.927
Mick (“ash says they had a plan but
the

203
00:05:57.927 --> 00:05:58.177
Mick Cash says they had a plan but
the government

204
00:05:58.177 --> 00:06:00.885
Mick Cash says they had a plan but
the governmentjumped in weekly.

205
00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:01.427
the government jumped in weekly.
Firstly,

206
00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.052
the governmentjumped in weekly.
Firstly, congratulations to Daniel

207
00:06:02.052 --> 00:06:02.885
Firstly, congratulations to Daniel
on his new

208
00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:04.094
Firstly, congratulations to Daniel
on his newjob and picking up on

209
00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:05.052
on his new job and picking up on
Mick’s point,

210
00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:05.719
on his newjob and picking up on
Mick’s point, you talked about

211
00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.094
Mick’s point, you talked about
capacity being low at the moment so

212
00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:08.719
capacity being low at the moment so
the first thing we need to do for

213
00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.344
the first thing we need to do for
people like Daniel is to get the

214
00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:11.719
people like Daniel is to get the
services up and running, to expand

215
00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.760
services up and running, to expand
capacity back to normal so we have

216
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.552
capacity back to normal so we have
more trains running, more buses

217
00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:17.344
more trains running, more buses
running, so there is more capacity.

218
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:19.135
running, so there is more capacity.
Then we need to encourage those who

219
00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:21.135
Then we need to encourage those who
don’t need to use public transport

220
00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:24.135
don’t need to use public transport
to walk or cycle where they can. A

221
00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:25.094
to walk or cycle where they ran. A
very large

222
00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:26.885
to walk or cycle where they can. A
very large number of people, 42% of

223
00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:27.427
very large number of people, 4296 of
people, their

224
00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:28.760
very large number of people, 42% of
people, their commute is less than

225
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.677
people, their commute is less than
three miles. If we can increase,

226
00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:31.135
three miles. If we ran increase,
particularty in

227
00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:32.302
three miles. If we can increase,
particularly in areas like London,

228
00:06:32.302 --> 00:06:32.510
particularty in areas like London,
the

229
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.844
particularly in areas like London,
the number of people walking and

230
00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:34.135
the number of peopla walking and
cycling-

231
00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:35.969
the number of people walking and
cycling, again, that takes pressure

232
00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.677
cycling, again, that takes pressure
off capacity to help people like

233
00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:39.719
off capacity to help people like
Daniel as key workers. 50 can you

234
00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:40.719
Daniel as key workers. So ran you
see yourself

235
00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.135
Daniel as key workers. So can you
see yourself doing that, walking or

236
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:42.302
see yourself doing that, walking or
carding

237
00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:44.135
see yourself doing that, walking or
cycling to work? Yes, I’ve been in

238
00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:45.594
cycling to work? Yes, I’ve been in
the House of Commons quite often, I

239
00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:48.094
the House of Commons quite often, I
would walk to work. What we have

240
00:06:48.094 --> 00:06:48.677
would walk to work. what we have
done, coming

241
00:06:48.677 --> 00:06:49.510
would walk to work. What we have
done, coming back to Daniel’s point

242
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.552
done, coming back to Daniel’s point
in terms of part of it, part of it

243
00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:56.635
in terms of part of it, part of it
is encouraging others and we have

244
00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:57.635
is encouraging others and we have
put investment into cycling to

245
00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:58.802
put investment into cycling to
encourage more cycling as part of

246
00:06:58.802 --> 00:07:00.510
encourage more cycling as part of
that but the third thing we need to

247
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.302
that but the third thing we need to
do is then have guidance for people

248
00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:02.885
do is then have guidance for peopla
who are using

249
00:07:02.885 --> 00:07:07.885
do is then have guidance for people
who are using the tube, support for

250
00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.885
who are using the tube, support for
workers in terms of PPE where that

251
00:07:09.885 --> 00:07:11.594
workers in terms of PPE where that
is appropriate in order to use the

252
00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:12.885
is appropriate in order to use the
capacity as safely as possible. But

253
00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:14.927
capacity as safely as possible. But
in terms of cycling, we have seen a

254
00:07:14.927 --> 00:07:16.135
in terms of cycling, we have seen a
massive increase in the use of

255
00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:16.344
massive increase in the use of
carding

256
00:07:16.344 --> 00:07:17.927
massive increase in the use of
cycling which is why we put

257
00:07:17.927 --> 00:07:18.677
cycling which is why we put
additional funding

258
00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:18.885
cycling which is why we put
additionalfunding into

259
00:07:18.885 --> 00:07:19.094
cycling which is why we put
additional funding into supported.

260
00:07:19.094 --> 00:07:19.302
cycling which is why we put
additionalfunding into supported. I

261
00:07:19.302 --> 00:07:19.885
additionalfunding into supported. I
will just feed

262
00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:21.885
additionalfunding into supported. I
willjust feed you some messages we

263
00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:22.094
will just feed you some messages we
have

264
00:07:22.094 --> 00:07:23.844
willjust feed you some messages we
have had. "Is it inevitable we will

265
00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:25.719
have had. "Is it inevitable we will
face a second wave given the

266
00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.302
face a second wave given the
overcrowding we have seen in public

267
00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:29.927
overcrowding we have seen in public
transport?" This one says, "After

268
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:31.677
transport?" This one says, "After
seeing a large number of people on

269
00:07:31.677 --> 00:07:33.094
seeing a large number of people on
the tube, should the government make

270
00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:36.469
the tube, should the government make
it compulsory to wear face coverings

271
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:38.135
it compulsory to wear face coverings
on public transport?" "The scenes on

on public transport?" "The scenes on
pub“:

on public transport?" "The scenes on
public transport this week has been

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:40.927
public transport this week has been
horrific with people in tubes and

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:41.719
horrific with peopla in tubes and
buses

cities, Berlin, Milan and Paris,

279
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.885
cities, Bertin, Milan and Paris,
they have

280
00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:53.260
cities, Berlin, Milan and Paris,
they have introduced things on the

281
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.760
they have introduced things on the
Metro, for example, stickers saying

282

Metro, for example, stickers saying
where you ran

283

Metro, for example, stickers saying
where you can enhance it, where you

where you ran enhance it, where you
ran and

285
00:07:57.094 --> 00:07:58.469
where you can enhance it, where you
can and can’t stand and you have to

286
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.885
ran and can’t stand and you have to
have a

287
00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:01.010
can and can’t stand and you have to
have a certificate if you want to go

288
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.677
have a certificate if you want to go
to work in rush—hour, for example.

289
00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:03.469
to work in rush-hour, for example.
If that something

290
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:04.094
to work in rush—hour, for example.
If that something the covenant is

If that something the covenant is
considering? In the guidance,

292
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.135
considering? In the guidance,
there’s lots of sensible things we

293
00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:09.510
there’s lots of sensible things we
would encourage people to do like

294
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.677
would encourage peopla to do like
using

295
00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:10.844
would encourage people to do like
using contactless payment. So

296
00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:11.094
using contacﬂass payment. So
nothing

297
00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:12.552
using contactless payment. 50
nothing like that in terms of social

298
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:14.885
nothing like that in terms of social
distancing? We can’t legislate for

299
00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:16.344
distancing? We can’t legislate for
everything or fact of life and every

300
00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:17.552
everything or fact of life and every
single circumstance but there are

301
00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:18.302
singla circumstance but there are
things that

302
00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:20.302
single circumstance but there are
things that can be done. Face

303
00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:20.552
things that ran be done. Face
coverings,

304
00:08:20.552 --> 00:08:23.969
things that can be done. Face
coverings, the advice from Stage is

305
00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:25.302
coverings, the advice from Stage is
for things like public transport,

306
00:08:25.302 --> 00:08:27.094
for things like public transport,
for short periods of time, they are

307
00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:28.635
for short periods of time, they are
recommending it but there are things

308
00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:29.802
recommending it but there are things
in the guidance like contactless

309
00:08:29.802 --> 00:08:29.969
in the guidance like contacﬂess
payments

310
00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:31.302
in the guidance like contactless
payments that can be used but the

311
00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:31.885
payments that ran be used but the
best thing to

312
00:08:31.885 --> 00:08:32.677
payments that can be used but the
best thing to do is increase the

313
00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:34.385
best thing to do is increase the
capacity which is why we need to see

314
00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:37.302
capacity which is why we need to see

the moment. We are in negotiations
with them to do so. That is why we

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.844
with them to do so. That is why we
have put 2.5 billion additional into

have put 2.5 billion additional into
the rail to get the capacity going.

School of crisis management, let

00:09:04.802 --> 00:09:06.302
School of crisis management, let
them use bikes. It’s not going to

338
00:09:06.302 --> 00:09:07.760
them use bikes. It’s not going to
solve the problem. You said yourself

339
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.719
solve the problem. You said yourself
that services were at 50% and the

that services were at 5096 and the
first thing for

who is trying to get work and again,
not just about many

00:09:16.927 --> 00:09:17.760
who is trying to get work and again,
notjust about many of our cities,

not just about many of our cities,
getting the

jump the gun, then? why did you turn
around

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:29.760
jump the gun, then? Why did you turn
around when we sat down and spent

356
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.219
around when we sat down and spent
two weeks of hard work making sure

two weeks of hard work making sure
that we had a plan for over a period

that we had a plan for over a period
of time, to allow proper services,

Minister’s speech on Sunday, we saw

362
00:09:41.969 --> 00:09:45.510
Minister’s speech on Sunday, we saw
an increase in usage on the rail

363
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.260
an increase in usage on the rail
network and we saw people, our

364
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.344
network and we saw people, our
members, having to deal with real

365
00:09:50.344 --> 00:09:50.469
members, having to deal with real
problams

366
00:09:50.469 --> 00:09:51.469
members, having to deal with real
problems about passengers. We had

367
00:09:51.469 --> 00:09:53.052
problems about passengers. We had
one example of a passenger crying

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:53.177
one example of a passenger crying
berause

369
00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:55.260
one example of a passenger crying
because she was worried about the

370
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.635
because she was worried about the
issue of social distancing on a

up because of what the Prime
Minister said on Sunday. We had not

376
00:10:02.177 --> 00:10:05.427
Minister said on Sunday. We had not
expected that. We did a deal last

377
00:10:05.427 --> 00:10:06.844
expected that. We did a deal last
week which had an incremental

378
00:10:06.844 --> 00:10:10.219
week which had an incremental
change, phasing in improvements on

379
00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:12.260
change, phasing in improvements on
train services, increasing capacity

train services, increasing capacity
but also allowing safe increased

but also allowing safe increased
capacity and the governmentjumped

383
00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:15.635
capacity and the government jumped
the gun. It is

384
00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:16.385
capacity and the governmentjumped
the gun. It is like the left hand

385
00:10:16.385 --> 00:10:18.094
the gun. It is like the left hand
does not know what the right hand is

does not know what the right hand is
doing. We are talking to the DFT but

392
00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:28.302
Transport. Devi Sridhar, listening
to this, what is your view? Yes, I

393
00:10:28.302 --> 00:10:29.969
to this, what is your view? Yes, I
just think it is tragic we are in

394
00:10:29.969 --> 00:10:33.385
just think it is tragic we are in
this situation. This issue about

395
00:10:33.385 --> 00:10:35.135
this situation. This issue about
safety, all this could have been

396
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.302
safety, all this could have been
dealt with many weeks ago. Other

397
00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:39.719
dealt with many weeks ago. Other
countries have stayed open and safe

398
00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:41.385
countries have stayed open and safe
by actually having public health

399
00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:42.719
by actually having public health
infrastructure in place to detect

400
00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:42.844
infrastmclure in place to detect
who

401
00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:44.177
infrastructure in place to detect
who had the virus so that when you

402
00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:46.052
who had the virus so that when you
do travel, you know that you are not

403
00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:48.135
do travel, you know that you are not
going to be exposing others, you

404
00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:49.885
going to be exposing others, you
know who is has got the virus and

405
00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:51.427
know who is has got the virus and
who doesn’t so you can make sure

406
00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:51.885
who doesn’t so you ran make sure
they are

407
00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:53.385
who doesn’t so you can make sure
they are isolated. Listening to this

408
00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:55.010
they are isolated. Listening to this
debate, is it safe currently to go

409
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.427
debate, is it safe currently to go
on public transport? I don’t think

410
00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:58.844
on public transport? I don’t think
so. Is it safe to open schools but I

411
00:10:58.844 --> 00:11:00.260
so. Is it safe to open schools but I
don’t think so because we don’t have

412
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.552
don’t think so because we don’t have
in place the basic building blocks

413
00:11:01.552 --> 00:11:03.385
in place the basic building blocks
of surveillance to know who has the

414
00:11:03.385 --> 00:11:05.510
of surveillance to know who has the
vims. If

415
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.385
of surveillance to know who has the
virus. If the lockdown starts

416
00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:06.760
vims. If the lockdown starts
opening up

417
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.010
virus. If the lockdown starts
opening up now before we have the

418
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.094
opening up now before we have the
infrastructure in place, it is

419
00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:09.885
infrastmclure in place, it is
basically

420
00:11:09.885 --> 00:11:11.844
infrastructure in place, it is
basically pointless. You should use

421
00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:13.427
basically pointless. You should use
the time to build the infrastructure

422
00:11:13.427 --> 00:11:14.219
the time to build the infrastmcture
that actually,

423
00:11:14.219 --> 00:11:14.885
the time to build the infrastructure
that actually, when you lift

424
00:11:14.885 --> 00:11:16.510
that actually, when you lift
lockdown, you are in a better

425
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.844
lockdown, you are in a better
position than you were when you went

426
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.594
position than you were when you went
in and I think I’m trying to get my

427
00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:20.969
in and I think I’m trying to get my
head around is in the past eight

428
00:11:20.969 --> 00:11:22.510
head around is in the past eight
weeks, you has been in a lockdown

429
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.427
weeks, you has been in a lockdown
which is costly and crude, very

430
00:11:24.427 --> 00:11:24.885
which is costly and cmde, very
drastic in

431
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.302
which is costly and crude, very
drastic in terms of the economic and

432
00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:27.469
drastic in terms of the economic and
social effects as well as the

433
00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:31.719
social effects as well as the
effects on nonessential services and

434
00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:32.635
effects on nonessential services and
the NHS, what has fundamentally

435
00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:33.969
the NHS, what has fundamentally
changed in the past eight weeks to

436
00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:35.719
changed in the past eight weeks to
put us in a better position to open

437
00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:39.719
put us in a better position to open
up? We are going to see cases go up,

438
00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:40.052
up? We are going to see cases go up,
I expect,

439
00:11:40.052 --> 00:11:40.385
up? We are going to see cases go up,
Iexpect, now,

440
00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:40.927
up? We are going to see cases go up,
I expect, now, the virus will

441
00:11:40.927 --> 00:11:42.135
I expect, now, the virus will
continue spreading and in a few

442
00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.552
continue spreading and in a few
weeks we are going to have this

443
00:11:43.552 --> 00:11:44.885
weeks we are going to have this
exact same debate again and it

444
00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:45.052
weeks we are going to have this
exact same debate again and itjust

445
00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:45.427
exact same debate again and it just
feels quite

446
00:11:45.427 --> 00:11:48.302
exact same debate again and itjust
feels quite tragic. Bridget, would

447
00:11:48.302 --> 00:11:49.885
feels quite tragic. Bridget, would
you travel on the tube at the

448
00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:51.885
you travel on the tube at the
moment? I think this comes down for

449
00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:54.969
moment? I think this comes down for
the need for government to provide

450
00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:56.844
the need for government to provide
clear guidance to all of us, it’s

451
00:11:56.844 --> 00:11:57.469
dear guidance to all of us, it’s
not just about

452
00:11:57.469 --> 00:11:57.635
clear guidance to all of us, it’s
not just about individual

453
00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:57.885
clear guidance to all of us, it’s
notjust about individual choices

454
00:11:57.885 --> 00:11:57.969
not just about individual choices
and

455
00:11:57.969 --> 00:11:59.885
notjust about individual choices
and what we saw on Sunday with the

456
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:01.177
and what we saw on Sunday with the
Prime Minister’s statement and what

457
00:12:01.177 --> 00:12:02.677
Prime Minister’s statement and what
followed was an unfortunate pattern

458
00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:04.260
followed was an unfortunate pattern
of confusion that I think has left a

459
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:04.802
of confusion that I think has left a
lot of peopla

460
00:12:04.802 --> 00:12:05.385
of confusion that I think has left a
lot of people wondering what the

461
00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:05.885
lot of peopla wondering what the
right thing

462
00:12:05.885 --> 00:12:07.552
lot of people wondering what the
right thing is to do. It is quite

463
00:12:07.552 --> 00:12:09.219
right thing is to do. It is quite
reasonable that all workers should

464
00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:10.469
reasonable that all workers should
expect a safe working environment

465
00:12:10.469 --> 00:12:12.344
expect a safe working environment
and that has to be done carefully

466
00:12:12.344 --> 00:12:13.260
and that has to be done carefully
and property.

467
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.510
and that has to be done carefully
and properly. It has to be worked

468
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:14.844
and property. It has to be worked
through with

469
00:12:14.844 --> 00:12:16.427
and properly. It has to be worked
through with those affected, with

470
00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:18.635
through with those affected, with
trade unions, too. And I don’t think

471
00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:18.969
trade unions, too. And I don’t think
giving peopla

472
00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:19.719
trade unions, too. And I don’t think
giving people such little notice

473
00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:20.052
giving peopla such little notice
that they

474
00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:22.010
giving people such little notice
that they could return to work has

475
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.885
that they could return to work has
helped in that way. There is also

476
00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:25.760
helped in that way. There is also
the big issue that lots of workers

477
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.052
the big issue that lots of workers
face real problems around what that

478
00:12:27.052 --> 00:12:27.469
face real problams around what that
will

479
00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:28.552
face real problems around what that
will mean for childcare while

480
00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:30.885
will mean for childcare while
schools remained closed in large

481
00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:32.510
schools remained closed in large
part other than to the children of

482
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.427
part other than to the children of
key workers and vulnerable children.

483
00:12:34.427 --> 00:12:36.135
key workers and vulnerable children.
The government’s response to that is

484
00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:38.302
The government’s response to that is
to expect employed to negotiate that

485
00:12:38.302 --> 00:12:40.427
to expect employed to negotiate that
on a case—by—case basis. Of course,

486
00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:40.844
on a ase-by-rase basis. Of course,
the vast

487
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:41.094
on a rase-by-rase basis. Of course,
the vast majority

488
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:41.635
on a case—by—case basis. Of course,
the vast majority of businesses and

489
00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:43.469
the vast majority of businesses and
employers will want to do the right

490
00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:44.885
employers will want to do the right
thing and they are responsible but I

491
00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:46.010
thing and they are responsible but I
don’t think such big decisions that

492
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.885
don’t think such big decisions that
have an effect on all of us can be

493
00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:49.135
have an effect on allofus ran be
left

494
00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:49.385
have an effect on all of us ran be
left some

495
00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:50.719
have an effect on all of us can be
left some unclear. I think we needed

496
00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:52.552
left some unclear. I think we needed
a clearer direction from government

497
00:12:52.552 --> 00:12:55.219
a clearer direction from government
and this confusion is really costly.

498
00:12:55.219 --> 00:12:56.302
and this confusion is really costly.
Specifically on transport, do you

499
00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:57.844
Specifically on transport, do you
think it is too early to be opening

500
00:12:57.844 --> 00:12:59.885
think it is too earty to be opening
up, then?

501
00:12:59.885 --> 00:13:00.885
think it is too early to be opening
up, then? Opening up the economy for

502
00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:02.885
up, then? Opening up the economy for
more workers to be going on public

503
00:13:02.885 --> 00:13:04.469
more workers to be going on public
transport, do you think it is too

504
00:13:04.469 --> 00:13:06.177
transport, do you think it is too
soon? We recognise there needs to be

505
00:13:06.177 --> 00:13:08.260
soon? We recognise there needs to be
a phased move to greater economic

506
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.177
a phased move to greater economic
activity. But it is to sue now? It

507
00:13:11.177 --> 00:13:12.135
activity. But it is to sue now? It
is unfortunate the Prime Minister

508
00:13:12.135 --> 00:13:14.344
is unfortunate the Prime Minister
and made a statement on Sunday with

509
00:13:14.344 --> 00:13:15.969
and made a statement on Sunday with
no guidance to back it up or clearly

510
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:16.135
no guidance to back it up or dearty
thought

511
00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:17.177
no guidance to back it up or clearly
thought through plan about how that

512
00:13:17.177 --> 00:13:18.385
thought through plan about how that
could be achieved and we’ve heard

513
00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:20.260
could be achieved and we’ve heard
from Mick this evening that if the

514
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.094
from Mick this evening that if the
government was to work more closely

515
00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:23.552
government was to work more closely
with trade unions and businesses and

516
00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:25.135
with trade unions and businesses and
try to find a more sensible way of

517
00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:26.844
try to find a more sensible way of
doing things, I think that would

518
00:13:26.844 --> 00:13:29.052
doing things, I think that would
leave people feeling safer. Do you

519
00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:31.510
leave people feeling safer. Do you
think it is too soon at the moment?

520
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.510
think it is too soon at the moment?
No, what we want to see is it is

521
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.802
No, what we want to see is it is
done in a careful and gradual way,

522
00:13:35.802 --> 00:13:37.552
done in a careful and gradual way,
so yes, where people can avoid

523
00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:37.719
so yes, where peopla ran avoid
pub“:

524
00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:38.760
so yes, where people can avoid
public transport, they should do so

525
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.802
public transport, they should do so
and Steve is right to say that but

526
00:13:40.802 --> 00:13:42.594
and Steve is right to say that but
it should not rest on individuals

527
00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:45.260
it should not rest on individuals
simply making that decision. We have

528
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.635
simply making that decision. We have
personal

529
00:13:45.635 --> 00:13:46.260
simply making that decision. We have
personaljudgment and discretion,

530
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:46.969
personal judgment and discretion,
yes, but the

531
00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:48.135
personaljudgment and discretion,
yes, but the absence of clear

532
00:13:48.135 --> 00:13:50.052
yes, but the absence of clear
direction from the government is

533
00:13:50.052 --> 00:13:52.260
direction from the government is
damaging. White Macalou, you just

534
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.177
damaging. white Maralou, you just
had a big sigh.

535
00:13:53.177 --> 00:13:55.427
damaging. White Macalou, you just
had a big sigh. Did it? I

536
00:13:55.427 --> 00:13:55.677
damaging. White Macalou, you just
had a big sigh. Did it? Ithink

537
00:13:55.677 --> 00:13:55.802
damaging. White Macalou, you just
had a big sigh. Did it? I think one

538
00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:57.427
had a big sigh. Did it? I think one
of the unfortunate things that has

539
00:13:57.427 --> 00:14:00.094
of the unfortunate things that has
happened is that the country has got

540
00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:03.010
happened is that the country has got
petrified. We are the most nervous

541
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.385
petrified. We are the most nervous
large nation of any. 50 the

542
00:14:06.385 --> 00:14:06.969
large nation of any. 50 the
government’s propaganda has

543
00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:11.510
government’s propaganda has
frightened us rigid... I mean, it

544
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.010
frightened us rigid... I mean, it
does look like we had the

545
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:13.802
does look like we had the
second—highest debts so maybe

546
00:14:13.802 --> 00:14:14.010
second-highest debts so maybe
there’s

547
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.635
second—highest debts so maybe
there’s a reason for that. How many

548
00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:17.010
there’s a reason for that. How many
peopla who

549
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:17.844
there’s a reason for that. How many
people who have no other morbidity

550
00:14:17.844 --> 00:14:18.219
peopla who have no other morbidity
is under

551
00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:20.219
people who have no other morbidity
is under the age of 60 have died

552
00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:22.302
is under the age of 60 have died
from this illness? Who have no other

553
00:14:22.302 --> 00:14:22.635
from this illness? who have no other
morbidity is

554
00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:23.927
from this illness? Who have no other
morbidity is because I can tell you

555
00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:24.094
morbidity is because I ran tell you
hammy

556
00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:26.052
morbidity is because I can tell you
hammy people under 65 have died?

557
00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:30.010
hammy peopla under 65 have died?
Maralou

558
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.677
hammy people under 65 have died?
Macalou —— under 60 with no other

559
00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:33.094
Maralou -- under 60 with no other
morbidity is,

560
00:14:33.094 --> 00:14:33.677
Macalou —— under 60 with no other
morbidity is, 350, you’re more

561
00:14:33.677 --> 00:14:37.094
morbidity is, 350, you’re more
likely to drown. More people a year

562
00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:37.469
likely to drown. More peopla a year
drown. I

563
00:14:37.469 --> 00:14:38.677
likely to drown. More people a year
drown. I think we have to get things

564
00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:42.219
drown. I think we have to get things
a bit in context. What can that

565
00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:42.677
a bit in context. what ran that
offer to

566
00:14:42.677 --> 00:14:43.885
a bit in context. What can that
offer to the families of those who

567
00:14:43.885 --> 00:14:45.885
offer to the families of those who
have lost loved ones? Every death is

568
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.469
have lost loved ones? Every death is
tragic but believe me, we are

569
00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:48.760
tragic but believe me, we are
entering, we are already in the

570
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.469
entering, we are already in the
largest recession for 300 years. In

571
00:14:51.469 --> 00:14:52.885
largest recession for 300 years. In
fact, it is not

572
00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:53.469
largest recession for 300 years. In
fact, it is notjust one recession,

573
00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:53.927
fact, it is not just one recession,
the bank

574
00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:54.885
fact, it is notjust one recession,
the bank of England has said the

575
00:14:54.885 --> 00:14:57.969
the bank of England has said the
economy will shrink by 1A%, that is

576
00:14:57.969 --> 00:14:58.594
economy will shrink by 1496, that is
the

577
00:14:58.594 --> 00:14:59.469
economy will shrink by 1A%, that is
the equivalent of two

578
00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:00.427
economy will shrink by 14%, that is
the equivalent of two recessions, it

579
00:15:00.427 --> 00:15:02.094
the equivalent of two recessions, it
is a depression. I wouldn’t be

580
00:15:02.094 --> 00:15:03.635
is a depression. I wouldn’t be
surprised if we have 2 million more

581
00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:06.719
surprised if we have 2 million more
unemployed people within a year.

582
00:15:06.719 --> 00:15:09.260
unemployed people within a year.
Imagine the agony of 2 million more

583
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.635
Imagine the agony of 2 million more
unemployed people. How many deaths

584
00:15:10.635 --> 00:15:10.927
unemployed people. How many deaths
might ﬂow

585
00:15:10.927 --> 00:15:13.219
unemployed people. How many deaths
might flow from that? How many

586
00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:13.385
might ﬂow from that? How many
deaths

587
00:15:13.385 --> 00:15:15.427
might flow from that? How many
deaths are flowing from the fact we

588
00:15:15.427 --> 00:15:16.219
deaths are ﬂowing from the fact we
have got half

589
00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:16.885
deaths are flowing from the fact we
have got half as many A&E

590
00:15:16.885 --> 00:15:18.885
have got half as many A&E
appointments at the moment is to

591
00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:20.385
appointments at the moment is to
mark cancer patients are not being

592
00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:21.719
mark cancer patients are not being
seen, people with heart disease are

593
00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:24.219
seen, people with heart disease are
not being seen. And the collateral

594
00:15:24.219 --> 00:15:27.969
not being seen. And the collateral
damage of this campaign of fear and

595
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.094
damage of this campaign of fear and
lockdown has to be taken into

596
00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:33.177
lockdown has to be taken into
account. Very soon, I believe,

597
00:15:33.177 --> 00:15:34.385
account. Very soon, I believe,
lockdown will be causing more deaths

598
00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:37.969
lockdown will be causing more deaths
than the virus. Just to be clear, in

599
00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:38.677
than the vims. just to be clear, in
terms of

600
00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:40.260
than the virus. Just to be clear, in
terms of deaths amongst those under

601
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.427
terms of deaths amongst those under
65 in total related to coronavirus,

602
00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:43.094
65 in total related to coronavims,
it is over

603
00:15:43.094 --> 00:15:47.802
65 in total related to coronavirus,
it is over 4000. Under 60, I said.

604
00:15:47.802 --> 00:15:49.802
it is over 4000. Under 60, I said.
Yes, some of them have

605
00:15:49.802 --> 00:15:50.719
Yes, some of them have
comorbidities, it is not necessarily

606
00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:52.385
comorbidities, it is not necessarily
that they were going to die anyway

607
00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:53.719
that they were going to die anyway
but they have other conditions they

608
00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.635
but they have other conditions they
live with. Every thread are, you are

609
00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:57.260
live with. Every thread are, you are
shaking your head?

610
00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:02.677
radical I want to come back to the
point about putting the economy

611
00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:04.135
point about putting the economy
versus public health and that is a

612
00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:06.510
versus public health and that is a
mistake. These are in the same side.

613
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.594
mistake. These are in the same side.
Containment is good for public

614
00:16:07.594 --> 00:16:08.885
Containment is good for public
health and the economy and that’s

615
00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.052
health and the economy and that’s
what we are seeing from the

616
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.010
what we are seeing from the
countries that moved early, their

617
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.260
countries that moved earty, their
locks

618
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.010
countries that moved early, their
locks down fast, that actually took

619
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.135
locks down fast, that actually took
the drastic measures, contain the

620
00:16:15.135 --> 00:16:17.635
the drastic measures, contain the
virus and are able to open up now. I

621
00:16:17.635 --> 00:16:19.302
virus and are able to open up now. I
think having these kind of debates

622
00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:19.635
think having these kind of debates
in Febmary

623
00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:21.677
think having these kind of debates
in February and March is what

624
00:16:21.677 --> 00:16:23.885
in February and March is what
created such confusion. What is the

625
00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:25.010
created such confusion. What is the
Government’s strategy? To let the

626
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.885
Government’s strategy? To let the
virus mn

627
00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:26.635
Government’s strategy? To let the
virus run through and stay within

628
00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:26.927
virus mn through and stay within
NHS

629
00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:28.552
virus run through and stay within
NHS capacity and basically think

630
00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:30.260
NHS capacity and basically think
that will save the economy? We are

631
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.094
that will save the economy? We are
learning that is not the right way,

632
00:16:32.094 --> 00:16:34.885
learning that is not the right way,
the way is to get on top of the

633
00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:36.719
the way is to get on top of the
virus aggressively, stay in lockdown

634
00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:39.302
virus aggressively, stay in lockdown
longer, stay in lockdown longer, do

635
00:16:39.302 --> 00:16:41.094
longer, stay in lockdown longer, do
it right and ease it and it is a

636
00:16:41.094 --> 00:16:41.302
it right and ease it and it is a
one-way

637
00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:42.010
it right and ease it and it is a
one—way street. Right now the

638
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:42.510
one-way street. Right now the
problem as

639
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.177
one—way street. Right now the
problem as it is not like the virus

640
00:16:44.177 --> 00:16:45.469
problem as it is not like the virus
magically disappears as we open, it

641
00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:46.844
magically disappears as we open, it
will still be around so that means

642
00:16:46.844 --> 00:16:48.385
will still be around so that means
it will continue spreading and at

643
00:16:48.385 --> 00:16:50.135
it will continue spreading and at
some point NHS capacity will be

644
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:53.260
some point NHS capacity will be
strained, we have already lost

645
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.969
strained, we have already lost
60,000 people, and we are 10% of the

646
00:16:54.969 --> 00:16:55.885
60,000 peopla, and we are 1096 of the
“Y

647
00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:56.094
60,000 peopla, and we are 1096 of the
way through

648
00:16:56.094 --> 00:16:56.885
60,000 people, and we are 10% of the
way through this, if we are

649
00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:58.260
way through this, if we are
fortunate we will find out soon. We

650
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.260
fortunate we will find out soon. We
have a long way to go and the way to

651
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.969
have a long way to go and the way to
do this is to stay in lockdown, get

652
00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:02.677
do this is to stay in lockdown, get
out property, it

653
00:17:02.677 --> 00:17:03.719
do this is to stay in lockdown, get
out properly, it is a one—way

654
00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:04.260
out property, it is a one-way
street, to

655
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.385
out properly, it is a one—way
street, to stop putting the economy

656
00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:06.719
street, to stop putting the economy
versus public health, they are both

657
00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:08.885
versus public health, they are both
on the same side. Let me come back

658
00:17:08.885 --> 00:17:10.510
on the same side. Let me come back
to Daniel. What do you think of what

659
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.260
to Daniel. what do you think of what
you have heard

660
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.219
to Daniel. What do you think of what
you have heard going back to your

661
00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:13.010
you have heard going back to your
original question about public

662
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.802
original question about public
transport? I think firstly there is

663
00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:17.385
transport? I think firstly there is
nothing wrong with trying to keep as

664
00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:18.094
nothing wrong with trying to keep as
many peopla

665
00:17:18.094 --> 00:17:20.677
nothing wrong with trying to keep as
many people are safe as possible.

666
00:17:20.677 --> 00:17:21.177
many peopla are safe as possible.
Secondly, I

667
00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:22.260
many people are safe as possible.
Secondly, I think we keep hearing a

668
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.885
Secondly, I think we keep hearing a
similar rhetoric from people like

669
00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:27.135
similar rhetoric from people like
Stephen and others in government but

670
00:17:27.135 --> 00:17:28.760
Stephen and others in government but
the fact is some of our public

671
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.052
the fact is some of our public
transport is still crowded and that

672
00:17:30.052 --> 00:17:32.552
transport is still crowded and that
means we need more action and the

673
00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.885
means we need more action and the
government needs to work

674
00:17:33.885 --> 00:17:35.302
government needs to work
collaboratively with trade unions

675
00:17:35.302 --> 00:17:36.760
collaboratively with trade unions
and other parties to try and solve

676
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.385
and other parties to try and solve
this. Steve, you want to come back

677
00:17:39.385 --> 00:17:41.885
this. Steve, you want to come back
in? The whole point of the

678
00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:43.760
in? The whole point of the
government strategy has been to get

679
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.635
government strategy has been to get
the R down and through the public

680
00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:49.427
the R down and through the public
efforts that has happened. It has

681
00:17:49.427 --> 00:17:50.719
efforts that has happened. It has
enabled us to have a gradual

682
00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:52.510
enabled us to have a gradual
phasing, which is what we have set

683
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.094
phasing, which is what we have set
out, where we have a gradual phasing

684
00:17:54.094 --> 00:17:58.427
out, where we have a gradual phasing
where we switch back on the economy,

685
00:17:58.427 --> 00:17:59.344
where we switch back on the economy,
retail in june at

686
00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:00.344
where we switch back on the economy,
retail inJune at areas like

687
00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:01.844
retail inJune at areas like
hospitality in

688
00:18:01.844 --> 00:18:02.594
retail inJune at areas like
hospitality inJuly but it’s

689
00:18:02.594 --> 00:18:03.385
hospitality inJuly but it’s
conditional, conditional on keeping

690
00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:05.427
conditional, conditional on keeping
that infection rate down. Where I do

691
00:18:05.427 --> 00:18:06.677
that infection rate down. where I do
agree as it is not

692
00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:07.344
that infection rate down. Where I do
agree as it is not a choice between

693
00:18:07.344 --> 00:18:09.719
agree as it is not a choice between
health and the economy because a

694
00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:11.344
health and the economy because a
second peak of infection would be

695
00:18:11.344 --> 00:18:13.052
second peak of infection would be
hugely damaging from an economic

696
00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:14.594
hugely damaging from an economic
point of view. The Governor of the

697
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.302
point of view. The Governor of the
Bank of England made a similar point

698
00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:18.052
Bank of England made a similar point
last night in terms of the effect

699
00:18:18.052 --> 00:18:19.552
last night in terms of the effect
that would have on public

700
00:18:19.552 --> 00:18:21.719
that would have on public
confidence. So we do need to get the

701
00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:23.344
confidence. So we do need to get the
infection down. That’s why we have

702
00:18:23.344 --> 00:18:24.385
infection down. That’s why we have
taken the unprecedented measures but

703
00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:26.094
taken the unprecedented measures but
we now need to have a phased

704
00:18:26.094 --> 00:18:29.135
we now need to have a phased
approach to the economy conditional

705
00:18:29.135 --> 00:18:31.802
approach to the economy conditional
on keeping the R down. We may come

706
00:18:31.802 --> 00:18:33.885
on keeping the R down. We may come
back to the economy shortly. Daniel,

707
00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:35.677
back to the economy shortly. Daniel,
thank you for your question. Let me

708
00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:36.760
thank you for your question. Let me
take a question from Samantha

709
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.594
take a question from Samantha
Grainger now. Hello.

710
00:18:40.594 --> 00:18:42.969
One of the most important things
about managing this crisis

711
00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:47.510
is the clarity of communication
by the government.

712
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.885
Following the release of the new key
message by the PM on the weekend,

713
00:18:50.885 --> 00:18:52.802
does the panel feel that
"stay alert, control

714
00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:54.177
the virus, save lives" has
any

715
00:18:54.177 --> 00:18:58.094
real meaning for the public?

716
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.135
Does it have any meaning for you,
Samantha? What do you think of it? I

717
00:19:06.135 --> 00:19:06.677
Samantha? what do you think of it? I
think it’s a

718
00:19:06.677 --> 00:19:07.844
Samantha? What do you think of it? I
think it’s a lot more vague than the

719
00:19:07.844 --> 00:19:10.469
think it’s a lot more vague than the
original message, I think it is

720
00:19:10.469 --> 00:19:13.719
original message, I think it is
really confusing and I think it’s

721
00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:15.010
really confusing and I think it’s
very hard to get any clear message

722
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.969
very hard to get any clear message
over to the public with this. And do

723
00:19:18.969 --> 00:19:21.135
over to the public with this. And do
you think, I’m just wondering, is

724
00:19:21.135 --> 00:19:22.135
you think, I’m just wondering, is
that inevitable, perhaps, when we

725
00:19:22.135 --> 00:19:23.885
that inevitable, perhaps, when we
are moving out of lockdown, that

726
00:19:23.885 --> 00:19:25.844
are moving out of lockdown, that
things will be slightly more woolly,

727
00:19:25.844 --> 00:19:30.594
things will be slightly more woolly,
for want of a better phrase? I think

728
00:19:30.594 --> 00:19:34.885
for want of a better phrase? I think
the message has changed too quickly.

729
00:19:34.885 --> 00:19:36.719
the message has changed too quickly.
I think changes could have been made

730
00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:39.760
I think changes could have been made
without rushing ahead in the way

731
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.469
without rushing ahead in the way
that I feel this is. Has it changed

732
00:19:42.469 --> 00:19:43.844
that I feel this is. Has it changed
what you are doing come out of

733
00:19:43.844 --> 00:19:47.385
what you are doing come out of
interest? I am actually shielding so

734
00:19:47.385 --> 00:19:50.552
interest? I am actually shielding so
it makes no difference to me. 0K.

735
00:19:50.552 --> 00:19:51.969
it makes no difference to me. 0K.
Stephen, there has been a lot of

736
00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:53.802
Stephen, there has been a lot of
talk about the message, there has

737
00:19:53.802 --> 00:19:55.552
talk about the message, there has
been a YouGov poll suggesting that

738
00:19:55.552 --> 00:19:58.177
been a YouGov poll suggesting that
SON:

739
00:19:58.177 --> 00:20:00.427
been a YouGov poll suggesting that
30% find the new slogan, let’s call

740
00:20:00.427 --> 00:20:00.927
3096 find the new slogan, let’s all
it that,

741
00:20:00.927 --> 00:20:02.885
30% find the new slogan, let’s call
it that, unclear, 90% found the old

742
00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:03.177
it that, unclear, 9096 found the old
one much

743
00:20:03.177 --> 00:20:04.802
it that, unclear, 90% found the old
one much clearer. You can’t be happy

744
00:20:04.802 --> 00:20:06.094
one much clearer. You can’t be happy
with that? There is no question that

745
00:20:06.094 --> 00:20:10.135
with that? There is no question that
the slogan stay at home was hugely

746
00:20:10.135 --> 00:20:11.219
the slogan stay at home was hugely
effective, look would say to

747
00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:12.594
effective, look would say to
effective because polling is showing

748
00:20:12.594 --> 00:20:14.844
effective because polling is showing
the British public are more fearful

749
00:20:14.844 --> 00:20:16.885
the British public are more fearful
of the virus than other Western

750
00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:18.385
of the virus than other Western
societies, even though it is the

751
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.760
societies, even though it is the
same virus that we are all

752
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.635
same virus that we are all
confronting. Although our focus

753
00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:21.844
confronting. Although our focus
EWUP

754
00:20:21.844 --> 00:20:23.594
confronting. Although our focus
group shows that actually the new

755
00:20:23.594 --> 00:20:25.052
group shows that actually the new
message has also resonated with the

756
00:20:25.052 --> 00:20:25.219
message has also resonated with the
pub“:

757
00:20:25.219 --> 00:20:27.427
message has also resonated with the
public and I think we have to treat

758
00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:29.052
public and I think we have to treat
the public as advanced adults. What

759
00:20:29.052 --> 00:20:29.302
the public as advanced adults. what
does

760
00:20:29.302 --> 00:20:31.719
the public as advanced adults. What
does resonated mean? Because people

761
00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:31.927
does resonated mean? Because peopla
do

762
00:20:31.927 --> 00:20:35.052
does resonated mean? Because people
do understand. You have 90% in one

763
00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:35.760
do understand. You have 9096 in one
poll

764
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.885
do understand. You have 90% in one
poll suggesting it is unclear. We

765
00:20:36.885 --> 00:20:38.177
poll suggesting it is unclear. We
have to treat the public with

766
00:20:38.177 --> 00:20:40.927
have to treat the public with
respect, they do understand that we

767
00:20:40.927 --> 00:20:42.427
respect, they do understand that we
need to apply common sense, those

768
00:20:42.427 --> 00:20:44.969
need to apply common sense, those
that need to stay at home to stay at

769
00:20:44.969 --> 00:20:46.469
that need to stay at home to stay at
home, those who can’t and need to

770
00:20:46.469 --> 00:20:48.594
home, those who can’t and need to
work do so. They work with their

771
00:20:48.594 --> 00:20:50.552
work do so. They work with their
employers, they then put in measures

772
00:20:50.552 --> 00:20:55.885
employers, they then put in measures
to ensure that those workplaces are

773
00:20:55.885 --> 00:20:58.719
to ensure that those workplaces are
Cove so, the way the British public

774
00:20:58.719 --> 00:21:01.885
Cove so, the way the British public
has responded shows they understand

775
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:04.927
has responded shows they understand
what the message requires, we have

776
00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:05.885
what the message requires, we have
been successful in getting the

777

been successful in getting the
infection rate down and we need to

778
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.010
infection rate down and we need to
continue in the British public

779
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.594
continue in the British public

at this stage and the difficultjob

at this stage and the difficult job
the

787
00:21:22.969 --> 00:21:24.510
at this stage and the difficultjob
the government has communicating in

788
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.010
the government has communicating in
this next stage. It is unfortunate

789
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.802
this next stage. It is unfortunate
we have had such confusion. With the

790
00:21:27.802 --> 00:21:29.010
we have had such confusion. With the
announcement on Sunday from the

791
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.510
announcement on Sunday from the
Prime Minister with the delay that

792
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.635
Prime Minister with the delay that
followed in their being proper

793
00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:33.302
followed in their being proper
guidance with further guidance to

794
00:21:33.302 --> 00:21:35.260
guidance with further guidance to
follow and this is just the start of

795
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.135
follow and this is just the start of
what will be a challenging process.

796
00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:37.510
what will be a challanging process.
The

797
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.594
what will be a challenging process.
The government are moving towards

798
00:21:38.594 --> 00:21:41.594
The government are moving towards
looking at a phased return for some

799
00:21:41.594 --> 00:21:42.760
looking at a phased return for some
children to school. Again, getting

800
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.927
children to school. Again, getting
the communication on that will be

801
00:21:44.927 --> 00:21:46.760
the communication on that will be
absolutely crucial, but it will also

802
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:46.927
absolutely cmcial, but it will also
involve

803
00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:48.219
absolutely crucial, but it will also
involve parents feeling confident in

804
00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:49.677
involve parents feeling confident in
sending their children back to

805
00:21:49.677 --> 00:21:49.927
sending their children hack to
school.

806
00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:51.385
sending their children back to
school. We will need to make sure

807
00:21:51.385 --> 00:21:53.385
school. We will need to make sure
that school staff, all school staff,

808
00:21:53.385 --> 00:21:54.635
that school staff, all school staff,
are confident they have a safe

809
00:21:54.635 --> 00:21:56.385
are confident they have a safe
working environment. If we don’t get

810
00:21:56.385 --> 00:21:58.052
working environment. If we don’t get
that right, it will mean that

811
00:21:58.052 --> 00:22:00.510
that right, it will mean that
children don’t return, it will mean

812
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.885
children don’t return, it will mean
that lots of people feel extremely

813
00:22:01.885 --> 00:22:04.469
that lots of people feel extremely
anxious and worried about what the

814
00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:05.760
anxious and worried about what the
future will hold. Of course, the

815
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.594
future will hold. Of course, the
reason for some of this worry is

816
00:22:07.594 --> 00:22:08.885
reason for some of this worry is
quite legitimate in that our testing

817
00:22:08.885 --> 00:22:11.510
quite legitimate in that our testing
rates are still far too low, the

818
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.219
rates are still far too low, the
government has consistently failed

819
00:22:12.219 --> 00:22:14.552
government has consistently failed
to meet its targets around testing.

820
00:22:14.552 --> 00:22:16.427
to meet its targets around testing.
Testing is of course not a strategy

821
00:22:16.427 --> 00:22:18.885
Testing is of course not a strategy
in and of itself, it is a means to

822
00:22:18.885 --> 00:22:20.552
in and of itself, it is a means to
achieving an outcome. But if we are

823
00:22:20.552 --> 00:22:22.094
achieving an outcome. But if we are
going to move through this process,

824
00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:24.260
going to move through this process,
if we are going to trust the British

825
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:24.760
if we are going to trust the British
peopla to

826
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.427
if we are going to trust the British
people to exercise more judgment,

827
00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.510
people to exercise more judgment,
then we must have clear messages

828
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.635
then we must have clear messages
from government around what that

829
00:22:28.635 --> 00:22:30.177
from government around what that
involves and what that looks like

830
00:22:30.177 --> 00:22:32.469
involves and what that looks like
and also move to a much stronger

831
00:22:32.469 --> 00:22:33.885
and also move to a much stronger
position on testing so that we can

832
00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:34.177
position on testing so that we ran
all feel

833
00:22:34.177 --> 00:22:35.385
position on testing so that we can
all feel confident that what’s being

834
00:22:35.385 --> 00:22:37.135
all feel confident that what’s being
asked of us by government is being

we want it to succeed because it’s

think the Welsh are wrong? Certain
areas are devolved. Of course it

areas are devolved. Of course it
would have been better if all four

would have been better if all four
parts of the United Kingdom had

parts of the United Kingdom had
moved in lockstep and it is

00:23:21.552 --> 00:23:22.302
moved in lockstep and it is
disappointing the Prime Minister

00:23:22.302 --> 00:23:24.719
disappointing the Prime Minister
wasn’t able to secure that consent.

wasn’t able to secure that consent.
What

870
00:23:24.885 --> 00:23:25.010
wasn’t able to secure that consent.
what we

wasn’t able to secure that consent.
What we will need to see is much

what we will need to see is much
greater

873
00:23:27.135 --> 00:23:28.302
What we will need to see is much
greater testing so that we can be

874
00:23:28.302 --> 00:23:31.719
greater testing so that we can be
confident that all of these measures

875
00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:33.760
confident that all of these measures
don’t see an increase... You have

876
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.635
don’t see an increase... You have
made that clear. To be clear of your

877
00:23:35.635 --> 00:23:37.010
made that clear. To be clear of your
position, you support the easing at

878
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.802
position, you support the easing at
the moment? I know you are unhappy

879
00:23:38.802 --> 00:23:40.885
the moment? I know you are unhappy
with the messaging and the lack of

880
00:23:40.885 --> 00:23:41.927
with the messaging and the lack of
communication with the unions, but

881
00:23:41.927 --> 00:23:43.594
communication with the unions, but
do you think the right decision was

882
00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:46.677
do you think the right decision was
taken by the government this week to

883
00:23:46.677 --> 00:23:47.969
taken by the government this week to
begin to lift restrictions? There

884
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:50.177
begin to lift restrictions? There
was always going to come a point

885
00:23:50.177 --> 00:23:51.844
was always going to come a point
when restrictions were eased. What I

886
00:23:51.844 --> 00:23:52.260
when restrictions were eased. what I
think it’s

887
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:52.885
when restrictions were eased. What I
think it’s unnecessary is the

888
00:23:52.885 --> 00:23:56.094
think it’s unnecessary is the
arbitrary dates. To put arbitrary

889
00:23:56.094 --> 00:23:58.094
arbitrary dates. To put arbitrary
dates on it and rush it without the

890
00:23:58.094 --> 00:23:59.385
dates on it and rush it without the
proper guidance in place is

891
00:23:59.385 --> 00:24:00.969
proper guidance in place is
unnecessary and we have seen the

892
00:24:00.969 --> 00:24:02.135
unnecessary and we have seen the
impact that has on public transport

893
00:24:02.135 --> 00:24:03.969
impact that has on public transport
and we have put an arbitrary date on

894
00:24:03.969 --> 00:24:05.635
and we have put an arbitrary date on
the phased return of school

895
00:24:05.635 --> 00:24:06.802
the phased return of school
reopening for some children. It is

896
00:24:06.802 --> 00:24:09.802
reopening for some children. It is
better to get it right than to rush

897
00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:12.885
better to get it right than to rush
it. The government of the people

898
00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:14.052
it. The government of the people
relying upon the evidence to

899
00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:15.677
relying upon the evidence to
determine whether it is exactly the

900
00:24:15.677 --> 00:24:17.677
determine whether it is exactly the
right point. It is not for us to

901
00:24:17.677 --> 00:24:18.510
right point. It is not for us to
provide an alternative narrative

902
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.385
provide an alternative narrative
around that. What we will do is

903
00:24:20.385 --> 00:24:21.010
around that. what we will do is
back-up the

904
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:21.969
around that. What we will do is
back—up the government where they

905
00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:22.802
back-up the government where they
are getting it

906
00:24:22.802 --> 00:24:23.760
back—up the government where they
are getting it right and be critical

907
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.969
are getting it right and be critical
and offer alternatives where we feel

908
00:24:24.969 --> 00:24:29.677
and offer alternatives where we feel
they aren’t. On testing and the lack

909
00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:32.594
they aren’t. On testing and the lack
of PPE and the problems we face in

910
00:24:32.594 --> 00:24:34.302
of PPE and the problems we face in
social care the fact a lot of school

911
00:24:34.302 --> 00:24:34.760
social rare the fact a lot of school
staff are

912
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.010
social care the fact a lot of school
staff are worried about what is

913
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.260
staff are worried about what is
coming, the government has to take

914
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.260
coming, the government has to take
the public with us. I agree with

915
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.510
the public with us. I agree with
Steve, it involves treating people

916
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.885
Steve, it involves treating people
as adults but to do that there has

917
00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:46.302
as adults but to do that there has
to be openness and transparency. Can

918
00:24:46.302 --> 00:24:47.344
to be openness and transparency. (“an

I clarify a point? We have not put

people were tested? That’s the
results of 127,000. I think you will

00:25:19.677 --> 00:25:22.885
results of 127,000. I think you will
find it 76,000 people actually

934
00:25:22.885 --> 00:25:23.052
find it 76,000 peopla actually
tested,

935
00:25:23.052 --> 00:25:24.260
find it 76,000 people actually
tested, 127,000 tests were carried

936
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.885
tested, 127,000 tests were carried
out, 76,000 people. 76,600 people

937
00:25:29.885 --> 00:25:30.219
out, 76,000 peopla. 76,600 peopla
were actually

938
00:25:30.219 --> 00:25:32.302
out, 76,000 people. 76,600 people
were actually tested. 50 not 126,000

939
00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:34.885
were actually tested. So not 126,000
people. It’s

940
00:25:34.885 --> 00:25:35.760
were actually tested. 50 not 126,000
people. It’s important. It’s

941
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.010
were actually tested. So not 126,000
people. It’s important. It’s about

942
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:36.719
peopla. It’s important. It’s about
peopla. It’s

943
00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:37.260
people. It’s important. It’s about
people. It’s not

944
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.719
people. It’s important. It’s about
people. It’s notjust a test in

945
00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:39.927
peopla. It’s not just a test in
itself.

946
00:25:39.927 --> 00:25:41.427
people. It’s notjust a test in
itself. 71,600 people tested. I want

947
00:25:41.427 --> 00:25:43.885
itself. 71,600 peopla tested. Iwant
to clarify this.

948
00:25:43.885 --> 00:25:45.469
itself. 71,600 people tested. I want
to clarify this. 30% find the new

949
00:25:45.469 --> 00:25:45.802
to clarify this. 3096 find the new
slogan and

950
00:25:45.802 --> 00:25:50.302
to clarify this. 30% find the new
slogan and clear, 90% found the old

951
00:25:50.302 --> 00:25:53.260
slogan and clear, 9096 found the old
slogan clear.

952
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.844
slogan and clear, 90% found the old
slogan clear. Luke, listening to

953
00:25:54.844 --> 00:25:55.385
slogan dear. Luke, listening to
this, this is

954
00:25:55.385 --> 00:25:56.594
slogan clear. Luke, listening to
this, this is about the message. But

955
00:25:56.594 --> 00:25:58.260
this, this is about the message. But
you feel that we shouldn’t be in the

956
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.510
you feel that we shouldn’t be in the
lockdown at all, do you? What

957
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.427
lockdown at all, do you? What
disappointed me most about the Prime

958
00:26:03.427 --> 00:26:04.760
disappointed me most about the Prime
Minister’s speech, which I think was

959
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.094
Minister’s speech, which I think was
vague and wasn’t really paying

960
00:26:06.094 --> 00:26:07.552
vague and wasn’t really paying
attention to the message, was the

961
00:26:07.552 --> 00:26:10.885
attention to the message, was the
fact he repeated the line that I

962
00:26:10.885 --> 00:26:12.969
fact he repeated the line that I
think is a figure first put about by

963
00:26:12.969 --> 00:26:16.885
think is a figure first put about by
Niall Ferguson, we have avoided

964
00:26:16.885 --> 00:26:18.885
Niall Ferguson, we have avoided
500,000 deaths. I don’t fix country

965
00:26:18.885 --> 00:26:19.844
500,000 deaths. I don’t fix country
was ever facing

966
00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:20.260
500,000 deaths. I don’t fix country
was everfacing 500,000

967
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.469
500,000 deaths. I don’t fix country
was ever facing 500,000 deaths,

968
00:26:20.469 --> 00:26:20.885
500,000 deaths. I don’t fix country
was everfacing 500,000 deaths, I

969
00:26:20.885 --> 00:26:21.719
was ever facing 500,000 deaths, I
think

970
00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:23.552
was everfacing 500,000 deaths, I
think that was a ludicrous

971
00:26:23.552 --> 00:26:24.219
think that was a ludicrous
exaggeration, it was scaremongering.

972
00:26:24.219 --> 00:26:25.052
exaggeration, it was sraremongering.
It was

973
00:26:25.052 --> 00:26:26.344
exaggeration, it was scaremongering.
It was half a million if nothing was

974
00:26:26.344 --> 00:26:29.677
It was half a million if nothing was
done. A bit like Sweden. Estimating

975
00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:31.260
done. A bit like Sweden. Estimating
about ten times the number of deaths

976
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.135
about ten times the number of deaths
they have had if his model had been

977
00:26:33.135 --> 00:26:36.427
they have had if his model had been
followed. And I don’t have a great

978
00:26:36.427 --> 00:26:38.094
followed. And I don’t have a great
deal of confidence in a lot of the

979
00:26:38.094 --> 00:26:39.719
deal of confidence in a lot of the
advice the government is getting,

980
00:26:39.719 --> 00:26:40.469
advice the government is getting,
I’m afraid. And so

981
00:26:40.469 --> 00:26:40.719
advice the government is getting,
I’m afraid. And sol

982
00:26:40.719 --> 00:26:41.885
advice the government is getting,
I’m afraid. And so I think that’s my

983
00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:43.552
I’m afraid. And so I think that’s my
problem with this speech. Let’s ask

984
00:26:43.552 --> 00:26:45.260
problem with this speech. Let’s ask
David because you are giving advice

985
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.885
David because you are giving advice
to the Scottish Government. What is

986
00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:49.427
to the Scottish Government. what is
your take? --

987
00:26:49.427 --> 00:26:51.385
to the Scottish Government. What is
yourtake? —— Devi. I

988
00:26:51.385 --> 00:26:51.760
to the Scottish Government. What is
yourtake? —— Devi. Ithink people

989
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.177
your take? -- Devi. Ithink peopla
are fearful

990
00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:53.052
yourtake? —— Devi. Ithink people
are fearful because they don’t know

991
00:26:53.052 --> 00:26:54.219
are fearful because they don’t know
where the virus is and they’re

992
00:26:54.219 --> 00:26:54.760
where the virus is and therre
looking at

993
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.594
where the virus is and they’re
looking at the neighbouring

994
00:26:55.594 --> 00:26:56.635
looking at the neighbouring
countries and seeing other countries

995
00:26:56.635 --> 00:26:59.094
countries and seeing other countries
seem to be on top of it. A clear way

996
00:26:59.094 --> 00:26:59.885
seem to be on top of it. A clear my
to figure out how

997
00:26:59.885 --> 00:27:01.010
seem to be on top of it. A clear way
to figure out how on top of that you

998
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.635
to figure out how on top of that you
are is through testing. If you are

999
00:27:02.635 --> 00:27:04.302
are is through testing. If you are
testing people and less than 2% are

1000
00:27:04.302 --> 00:27:05.219
testing peopla and lass than 296 are
positive you

1001
00:27:05.219 --> 00:27:06.135
testing people and less than 2% are
positive you are in pretty good

1002
00:27:06.135 --> 00:27:08.094
positive you are in pretty good
shape, this is where South Korea and

1003
00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:09.510
shape, this is where South Korea and
New Zealand are. If you are testing

1004
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.427
New Zealand are. If you are testing
peopla at

1005
00:27:10.427 --> 00:27:11.635
New Zealand are. If you are testing
people at around 5% you barely have

1006
00:27:11.635 --> 00:27:12.344
peopla at around 596 you barely have
a handla

1007
00:27:12.344 --> 00:27:14.635
people at around 5% you barely have
a handle on it, if it is over 10%

1008
00:27:14.635 --> 00:27:15.469
a handla on it, if it is over 1096
you have a huge

1009
00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:16.927
a handle on it, if it is over 10%
you have a huge problem and we are

1010
00:27:16.927 --> 00:27:17.510
you have a huge problem and we are
finding over 1096

1011
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.510
you have a huge problem and we are
finding over 10% and it leads to the

1012
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.427
finding over 1096 and it leads to the
question,

1013
00:27:19.427 --> 00:27:20.510
finding over 10% and it leads to the
question, where is this virus? What

1014
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.302
question, where is this vims? what
we actually

1015
00:27:21.302 --> 00:27:21.802
question, where is this virus? What
we actually need is clear

1016
00:27:21.802 --> 00:27:24.469
we actually need is clear
information and local information on

1017
00:27:24.469 --> 00:27:25.552
information and local information on
transmission in different parts of

1018
00:27:25.552 --> 00:27:27.094
transmission in different parts of
the country. If you know they are

1019
00:27:27.094 --> 00:27:28.052
the country. If you know they are
part of the country where

1020
00:27:28.052 --> 00:27:29.510
part of the country where
transmission is very low and there

1021
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.969
transmission is very low and there
is a low number of cases then

1022
00:27:30.969 --> 00:27:31.260
is a low number of cases than
obviously it

1023
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.677
is a low number of cases then
obviously it is safer for people to

1024
00:27:32.677 --> 00:27:33.177
obviously it is safer for peopla to
go out and

1025
00:27:33.177 --> 00:27:34.260
obviously it is safer for people to
go out and you can share that

1026
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.594
go out and you can share that
information and people actually know

1027
00:27:35.594 --> 00:27:36.469
information and peopla actually know
this. This

1028
00:27:36.469 --> 00:27:38.010
information and people actually know
this. This is a strategy many other

1029
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.927
this. This is a strategy many other
countries are taking. And just a

1030
00:27:39.927 --> 00:27:41.260
countries are taking. And just a
note on the Sweden, Sweden has one

1031
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.885
note on the Sweden, Sweden has one
of the highest death rates per

1032
00:27:42.885 --> 00:27:45.052
of the highest death rates per
million in the world, and far higher

1033
00:27:45.052 --> 00:27:48.094
million in the world, and far higher
than its neighbouring countries. But

1034
00:27:48.094 --> 00:27:49.260
than its neighbouring countries. But
not higher than Belgium or Holland.

1035
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.969
not higher than Belgium or Holland.
Lower. They themselves said they

1036
00:27:52.969 --> 00:27:55.469
Lower. They themselves said they
have not protected the elderly and

1037
00:27:55.469 --> 00:27:57.677
have not protected the elderly and
vulnerable. Can I ask you about

1038
00:27:57.677 --> 00:27:59.094
vulnerable. (“an I ask you about
Luke’s point

1039
00:27:59.094 --> 00:27:59.885
vulnerable. Can I ask you about
Luke’s point about the 500,000

1040
00:27:59.885 --> 00:28:02.469
Luke’s point about the 500,000
predicted deaths if nothing was done

1041
00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:03.719
predicted deaths if nothing was done
in this country, 500,000 over a

1042
00:28:03.719 --> 00:28:06.135
in this country, 500,000 over a
couple of years. I didn’t say that,

1043
00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:06.677
couple of years. I didn’t say that,
he just said

1044
00:28:06.677 --> 00:28:08.510
couple of years. I didn’t say that,
hejust said 500,000. You think

1045
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.677
he just said 500,000. You think
that’s

1046
00:28:08.677 --> 00:28:10.927
hejust said 500,000. You think
that’s nonsense. That was

1047
00:28:10.927 --> 00:28:14.510
that’s nonsense. That was
scaremongering. Do you think that

1048
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.677
sraremongering. Do you think that
was

1049
00:28:14.677 --> 00:28:16.802
scaremongering. Do you think that
was nonsense, Devi? We have had

1050
00:28:16.802 --> 00:28:18.552
was nonsense, Devi? We have had
60,000 estimated deaths so far. We

1051
00:28:18.552 --> 00:28:19.177
60,000 estimated deaths so far. We
are 1096

1052
00:28:19.177 --> 00:28:20.552
60,000 estimated deaths so far. We
are 10% of the way through this. If

1053
00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:21.010
are 1096 of the way through this. If
we think

1054
00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.760
are 10% of the way through this. If
we think we reach some kind of

1055
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.885
we think we reach some kind of
immunity at 80% we basically have to

1056
00:28:24.885 --> 00:28:25.510
immunity at 8096 we basically have to
lose eight

1057
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.594
immunity at 80% we basically have to
lose eight times that amount, so

1058
00:28:26.594 --> 00:28:27.594
lose eight times that amount, so
actually the figures are slightly

1059
00:28:27.594 --> 00:28:29.052
actually the figures are slightly
lower than the ones estimated but

1060
00:28:29.052 --> 00:28:30.719
lower than the ones estimated but
they are still incredibly high. It’s

1061
00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:32.802
they are still incredibly high. It’s
a lot of people that we would lose

1062
00:28:32.802 --> 00:28:32.885
a lot of peopla that we would lose
if

1063
00:28:32.885 --> 00:28:34.969
a lot of people that we would lose
if we just took a strategy rather

1064
00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:37.260
if we just took a strategy rather
than actually trying to suppress the

1065
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.135
than actually trying to suppress the
outbreak, wait for a therapeutic,

1066
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:41.969
outbreak, wait for a therapeutic,
wait for a vaccine and actually be

1067
00:28:41.969 --> 00:28:44.969
wait for a vaccine and actually be
able to... When did they discover a

1068
00:28:44.969 --> 00:28:45.385
able to... when did they discover a
vaccine for

1069
00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:50.344
able to... When did they discover a
vaccine for Aids. We have

1070
00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:51.385
vaccine for Aids. We have
anti—retrovirals for Aids. But how

1071
00:28:51.385 --> 00:28:51.927
anti-retrovirals for Aids. But how
long did that

1072
00:28:51.927 --> 00:28:55.885
anti—retrovirals for Aids. But how
long did that take? Mick, I’m going

1073
00:28:55.885 --> 00:28:57.885
long did that take? Mick, I’m going
to come to you, but I want to play

1074
00:28:57.885 --> 00:28:58.052
to come to you, but I wantto play
in

1075
00:28:58.052 --> 00:28:58.844
to come to you, but I want to play
in one other dip

1076
00:28:58.844 --> 00:28:59.635
to come to you, but I want to play
in one other clip which is on a

1077
00:28:59.635 --> 00:29:02.094
in one other dip which is on a
similar

1078
00:29:02.094 --> 00:29:03.344
in one other clip which is on a
similar subject, Jane Fallon. I will

1079
00:29:03.344 --> 00:29:03.552
similar subject, jane Fallon. I will
come

1080
00:29:03.552 --> 00:29:06.385
similar subject, Jane Fallon. I will
come back to you Samantha.

1081
00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:08.802
As a grandmother, I’m unable
to enter my grandchildren’s homes.

1082
00:29:08.802 --> 00:29:11.635
However, as their Childminder,
I would be able to enter their home

1083
00:29:11.635 --> 00:29:14.135
and they could come to my home.

1084
00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:19.135
Please can the rationale
for this be explained?

1085
00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:25.260
Perhaps it’s purely financial
as one does not allow

1086
00:29:26.135 --> 00:29:29.219
their parents to work,
that’s me, seeing my grandchildren,

1087
00:29:29.219 --> 00:29:34.260
spending a little bit of time
with them, while the other does.

1088
00:29:34.594 --> 00:29:37.469
Garden centres have been permitted
to open, as they are beneficial

1089
00:29:37.469 --> 00:29:42.510
to mental health, but surely
seeing your family is even better

1090
00:29:44.177 --> 00:29:46.385
for your mental health
and I’m saying this

1091
00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:51.385
as a grandmother to eight.

1092
00:29:53.885 --> 00:29:54.010
So,

1093
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:54.302
50, Jane

1094
00:29:54.302 --> 00:29:54.510
So, Janejust

1095
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.552
50, Jane just doesn’t really
understand why you made the decision

1096
00:29:57.552 --> 00:29:58.427
understand why you made the decision
you have. I

1097
00:29:58.427 --> 00:29:58.802
understand why you made the decision
you have. Iwill come

1098
00:29:58.802 --> 00:29:59.677
understand why you made the decision
you have. I will come back to you,

1099
00:29:59.677 --> 00:30:00.510
you have. I will come back to you,
but Mick, let’s hear

1100
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:00.802
you have. I will come back to you,
but Mick, let’s hearfrom

1101
00:30:00.802 --> 00:30:02.344
you have. I will come back to you,
but Mick, let’s hear from you.

1102
00:30:02.344 --> 00:30:02.677
you have. I will come back to you,
but Mick, let’s hearfrom you. I

1103
00:30:02.677 --> 00:30:03.052
but Mick, let’s hear from you. I
watched

1104
00:30:03.052 --> 00:30:04.135
but Mick, let’s hearfrom you. I
watched what was billed something

1105
00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:07.927
watched what was billed something
important, the speech on Sunday, so

1106
00:30:07.927 --> 00:30:09.885
important, the speech on Sunday, so
there might have been more people

1107
00:30:09.885 --> 00:30:12.344
there might have been more people
watching EastEnders. It was about 30

1108
00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:12.885
watching EastEnders. It was about 30
million, I think.

1109
00:30:12.885 --> 00:30:13.594
watching EastEnders. It was about 30
million, Ithink. I may have

1110
00:30:13.594 --> 00:30:13.760
watching EastEnders. It was about 30
million, I think. I may have that

1111
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.927
million, I think. I may have that
wrong but I think it’s 30 million. I

1112
00:30:15.927 --> 00:30:17.927
wrong but I think it’s 30 million. I
sat down and watched it and turned

1113
00:30:17.927 --> 00:30:20.385
sat down and watched it and turned
round to my wife and said, what did

1114
00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.760
round to my wife and said, what did
he say? That stay alert, I think

1115
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:21.885
he say? That stay alart, I think
I’ve

1116
00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:24.802
he say? That stay alert, I think
I’ve been alert for quite a period

1117
00:30:24.802 --> 00:30:25.385
I’ve been alert for quite a period
of time. why

1118
00:30:25.385 --> 00:30:28.635
I’ve been alert for quite a period
of time. Why he wants me to stay

1119
00:30:28.635 --> 00:30:29.094
of time. why he wants me to stay
alart, I

1120
00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:29.260
of time. why he wants me to stay
alart, Idon’t

1121
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.802
of time. Why he wants me to stay
alert, I don’t know. Then we find

1122
00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:31.344
alart, I don’t know. Then we find
out in dribs

1123
00:30:31.344 --> 00:30:32.135
alert, I don’t know. Then we find
out in dribs and drabs over the

1124
00:30:32.135 --> 00:30:35.510
out in dribs and drabs over the
following few days about other

1125
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.344
following few days about other
easing about what you can and can’t

1126
00:30:37.344 --> 00:30:38.510
easing about what you ran and can’t
do. The

1127
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.385
easing about what you can and can’t
do. The example there, I’ve got

1128
00:30:39.385 --> 00:30:42.469
do. The example there, I’ve got
three grandkids, my wife and I have

1129
00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:45.052
three grandkids, my wife and I have
had the same debate. We haven’t been

1130
00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:49.010
had the same debate. We haven’t been
able to see them. Skype and FaceTime

1131
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:52.219
able to see them. Skype and FaceTime
and things like that but there seems

1132
00:30:52.219 --> 00:30:53.510
and things like that but there seems
to be an inconsistency, and

1133
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.510
to be an inconsistency, and
inconsistency into the point that

1134
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.344
inconsistency into the point that
you ran go to

1135
00:30:55.344 --> 00:31:00.677
inconsistency into the point that
you can go to a park and

1136
00:31:01.302 --> 00:31:01.635
you can go to a park and keep two

1137
00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:02.094
you ran go to a park and keep two
metres away

1138
00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:03.177
you can go to a park and keep two
metres away from somebody but you

1139
00:31:03.177 --> 00:31:04.719
metres away from somebody but you
ran get on a

1140
00:31:04.719 --> 00:31:05.302
metres away from somebody but you
can get on a jam—packed bus or

1141
00:31:05.302 --> 00:31:05.510
ran get on a jam-packed bus or
train.

1142
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.760
can get on a jam—packed bus or
train. There is a lot of

1143
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.094
train. There is a lot of
inconsistency in what the government

1144
00:31:08.094 --> 00:31:09.260
inconsistency in what the government
is saying. (“an I

1145
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.344
inconsistency in what the government
is saying. Can Ijust pick up on

1146
00:31:10.344 --> 00:31:10.469
is saying. (“an Ijust pick up on
something

1147
00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:11.927
is saying. Can Ijust pick up on
something Luke said to me early on

1148
00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:12.469
something Luke said to me earty on
but that’s

1149
00:31:12.469 --> 00:31:13.719
something Luke said to me early on
but that’s worrying me about this

1150
00:31:13.719 --> 00:31:13.885
but that’s worrying me about this
whola

1151
00:31:13.885 --> 00:31:16.677
but that’s worrying me about this
whole debate about Luke’s rationale.

1152
00:31:16.677 --> 00:31:17.885
whola debate about Luke’s rationala.
I’d like to

1153
00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:19.302
whole debate about Luke’s rationale.
I’d like to know what you mean about

1154
00:31:19.302 --> 00:31:21.010
I’d like to know what you mean about
campaign of fear. All the issues

1155
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.010
campaign of fear. All the issues
that we are raising, the concerns we

1156
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:26.635
that we are raising, the concerns we
have got more people are dying. I’ve

1157
00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:27.719
have got more peopla are dying. I’ve
had have

1158
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.469
have got more people are dying. I’ve
had have been on the rail with me

1159
00:31:29.469 --> 00:31:29.969
had have been on the rail with me
for 40 odd

1160
00:31:29.969 --> 00:31:31.260
had have been on the rail with me
for A0 odd years and they said when

1161
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:31.594
for 40 odd years and they said when
this first

1162
00:31:31.594 --> 00:31:32.219
for A0 odd years and they said when
this first started, the government

1163
00:31:32.219 --> 00:31:34.844
this first started, the government
got it right, stay—at—home. First

1164
00:31:34.844 --> 00:31:35.177
got it right, stay-at-home. First
started, I

1165
00:31:35.177 --> 00:31:36.719
got it right, stay—at—home. First
started, I don’t want to go to work,

1166
00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.094
started, I don’t want to go to work,
I’m frightened for myself, I’m

1167
00:31:38.094 --> 00:31:40.260
I’m frightened for myself, I’m
frightened that I’m going to go home

1168
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.094
frightened that I’m going to go home
and pass the virus on to my wife and

1169
00:31:44.094 --> 00:31:44.469
and pass the virus on to my wife and
her elderty

1170
00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:48.344
and pass the virus on to my wife and
her elderly parents. People have the

1171
00:31:48.344 --> 00:31:49.010
her elderty parents. People have the
right to be

1172
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.885
her elderly parents. People have the
right to be fearful of what’s going

1173
00:31:49.885 --> 00:31:51.635
right to be fearful of what’s going
on because it is a deadly virus. I

1174
00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:52.094
on because it is a deadly vims. I
just wonder

1175
00:31:52.094 --> 00:31:52.885
on because it is a deadly virus. I
just wonder coming out of this

1176
00:31:52.885 --> 00:31:55.302
just wonder coming out of this
whether the government has got it

1177
00:31:55.302 --> 00:31:57.010
whether the government has got it
right, and hasn’t got it right, but

1178
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.385
right, and hasn’t got it right, but
why it hasn’t got it right. And why

1179
00:31:59.385 --> 00:32:01.510
why it hasn’t got it right. And why
they haven’t put a clear messaging

1180
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:01.844
they haven’t put a dear messaging
and a

1181
00:32:01.844 --> 00:32:03.844
they haven’t put a clear messaging
and a clear timetable so that we

1182
00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:05.885
and a clear timetable so that we
understand where this is going to

1183
00:32:05.885 --> 00:32:11.427
understand where this is going to
end. They bludgeoned into this and

1184
00:32:11.427 --> 00:32:12.302
end. They hludgeoned into this and
they seem to

1185
00:32:12.302 --> 00:32:13.885
end. They bludgeoned into this and
they seem to be bludgeoning out of

1186
00:32:13.885 --> 00:32:18.969
they seem to be bludgeoning out of
it.

1187
00:32:19.385 --> 00:32:22.385
Samantha who asked the original
question accepted it will be more

1188
00:32:22.385 --> 00:32:26.344
question accepted it will be more
complicated now when you spoke about

1189
00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.260
complicated now when you spoke about
testing, the 126,000 tests, 71,600

1190
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.177
testing, the 126,000 tests, 71,600
actually tested but in terms of

1191
00:32:30.177 --> 00:32:31.760
actually tested but in terms of
messaging and making that clear and

1192
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.469
messaging and making that clear and
transparent, do you feel you are

1193
00:32:33.469 --> 00:32:36.302
transparent, do you feel you are
actually winning that battle? It is

1194
00:32:36.302 --> 00:32:36.594
actually winning that hath? It is
very

1195
00:32:36.594 --> 00:32:38.260
actually winning that battle? It is
very difficult for families and we

1196
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.385
very difficult for families and we
recognise that, I think for all our

1197
00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:42.219
recognise that, I think for all our
families, with grandparents not able

1198
00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:44.885
families, with grandparents not able
to see grandchildren and that is one

1199
00:32:44.885 --> 00:32:46.677
to see grandchildren and that is one
of the heartbreaks of this crisis.

1200
00:32:46.677 --> 00:32:48.177
of the heartbreaks of this crisis.
And when you hear Mick saying you

1201
00:32:48.177 --> 00:32:50.260
And when you hear Mick saying you
could meet someone in a park, if we

1202
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.844
could meet someone in a park, if we
are meeting in a park it has to be

1203
00:32:52.844 --> 00:32:54.344
are meeting in a park it has to be
two metres distant but you can cram

1204
00:32:54.344 --> 00:32:54.677
two metres distant but you ran cram
onto a

1205
00:32:54.677 --> 00:32:56.094
two metres distant but you can cram
onto a tube or bus with somebody,

1206
00:32:56.094 --> 00:32:57.385
onto a tube or bus with somebody,
you are advising face coverings but

1207
00:32:57.385 --> 00:32:58.885
you are advising face coverings but
it is not mandatory. It is about

1208
00:32:58.885 --> 00:33:00.385
it is not mandatory. It is about
having a balance and what we are

1209
00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:02.635
having a balance and what we are
trying to do is limit the amount of

1210
00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:04.469
trying to do is limit the amount of
travel on public transport but we

1211
00:33:04.469 --> 00:33:06.135
travel on public transport but we
are trying to gradually phase back

1212
00:33:06.135 --> 00:33:08.677
are trying to gradually phase back
the economy because as Luke alluded

1213
00:33:08.677 --> 00:33:09.052
the economy because as Luke alluded
to eartier,

1214
00:33:09.052 --> 00:33:09.844
the economy because as Luke alluded
to earlier, the economic damage this

1215
00:33:09.844 --> 00:33:11.260
to eartier, the economic damage this
has

1216
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.052
to earlier, the economic damage this
has caused as a consequence of that.

1217
00:33:13.052 --> 00:33:15.927
has caused as a consequence of that.
There’s health consequences of the

1218
00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.427
There’s health consequences of the
fall in GDP and the impact of the

1219
00:33:17.427 --> 00:33:20.885
fall in GDP and the impact of the
economy. There’s health consequences

1220
00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:23.385
economy. There’s health consequences
in terms of wider treatment other

1221
00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.427
in terms of wider treatment other
than Covid within the NHS so it is

1222
00:33:25.427 --> 00:33:26.885
than Covid within the NHS so it is
important to have a strong economy

1223
00:33:26.885 --> 00:33:28.969
important to have a strong economy
to pay for public services and

1224
00:33:28.969 --> 00:33:32.385
to pay for public services and
support people’s health and

1225
00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:34.010
support people’s health and
well—being and phase part of that

1226
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.427
well-being and phase part of that
but the

1227
00:33:34.427 --> 00:33:36.885
well—being and phase part of that
but the bigger risks the economy and

1228
00:33:36.885 --> 00:33:38.677
but the bigger risks the economy and
the UK is a second peak so we are

1229
00:33:38.677 --> 00:33:41.344
the UK is a second peak so we are
trying to do it in a measured way,

1230
00:33:41.344 --> 00:33:45.969
trying to do it in a measured way,
in a balanced way. The risk, as Sage

1231
00:33:45.969 --> 00:33:46.969
in a balanced way. The risk, as Sage
advises, of transmission outside is

1232
00:33:46.969 --> 00:33:48.052
advises, of transmission outside is
lass than

1233
00:33:48.052 --> 00:33:49.760
advises, of transmission outside is
less than it is inside. That is why

1234
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:49.844
lass than it is inside. That is why
the

1235
00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:51.427
less than it is inside. That is why
the advice has been shaped in the

1236
00:33:51.427 --> 00:33:51.635
the advice has been shaped in the
“Y

1237
00:33:51.635 --> 00:33:53.719
the advice has been shaped in the
way it is. But it is conditional on

1238
00:33:53.719 --> 00:33:54.927
way it is. But it is conditional on
continuing to keep the infection

1239
00:33:54.927 --> 00:33:56.927
continuing to keep the infection
rate down and that is why it is a

1240
00:33:56.927 --> 00:33:58.260
rate down and that is why it is a
very gradual approach. You talk

1241
00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.927
very gradual approach. You talk
about the economy and we’ve got a

1242
00:33:59.927 --> 00:34:01.219
about the economy and we’ve got a
question about that from Aaron

1243
00:34:01.219 --> 00:34:03.094
question about that from Aaron
jones.

1244
00:34:03.094 --> 00:34:06.760
At the start of Covid—19 crisis,
we were informed a mortality rate

1245
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.885
of 20,000 would be a good outcome.

1246
00:34:10.885 --> 00:34:15.885
This has been exceeded.

1247
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.469
It has also been reported
by Professor Spiegelhalter that

1248
00:34:22.135 --> 00:34:25.469
of the unexpected deaths,
there is a greater proportion

1249
00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:30.510
of non—Covid deaths
than official Covid deaths.

1250
00:34:32.385 --> 00:34:36.344
Given this, how do the panel rate
the government’s performance and has

1251
00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:41.344
the pill been worse than the ill?

1252
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.260
Luke, from what you are saying so
far this evening, you think that it

1253
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.177
far this evening, you think that it
has been worse? I think there is a

1254
00:34:48.177 --> 00:34:50.510
has been worse? I think there is a
grave risk now that as we enter the

1255
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.885
grave risk now that as we enter the
Knights week period of lockdown,

1256
00:34:51.885 --> 00:34:54.344
Knights week period of lockdown,
that that will be the case, yes.

1257
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:54.635
that that will be the use, yes.
Virtually

1258
00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:56.510
that that will be the case, yes.
Virtually every other European

1259
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.927
Virtually every other European
country is now opening up. Schools

1260
00:34:58.927 --> 00:35:00.052
country is now opening up. Schools
are open, businesses are trading,

1261
00:35:00.052 --> 00:35:01.885
are open, businesses are trading,
even restaurants and bars are

1262
00:35:01.885 --> 00:35:04.552
even restaurants and bars are
opening sometimes and yes, they are

1263
00:35:04.552 --> 00:35:05.635
opening sometimes and yes, they are
practising social distancing but

1264
00:35:05.635 --> 00:35:06.010
practising social distancing but
dcarty,

1265
00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.135
practising social distancing but
clearly, they have got the same

1266
00:35:07.135 --> 00:35:07.510
dearty, they have got the same
virus

1267
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.094
clearly, they have got the same
virus that we have and yes, some of

1268
00:35:10.094 --> 00:35:11.094
virus that we have and yes, some of
them have perhaps done testing

1269
00:35:11.094 --> 00:35:14.094
them have perhaps done testing
better than we have and maybe they

1270
00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:15.677
better than we have and maybe they
have treated patients better than we

1271
00:35:15.677 --> 00:35:20.010
have treated patients better than we
have but overall, they are similar

1272
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.760
have but overall, they are similar
and they are obviously taking a view

1273
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.719
and they are obviously taking a view
that they ran

1274
00:35:22.719 --> 00:35:23.510
and they are obviously taking a view
that they can keep the virus under

1275
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.677
that they ran keep the virus under
control

1276
00:35:23.677 --> 00:35:27.469
that they can keep the virus under
control and keep the deaths to a

1277
00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:31.719
control and keep the deaths to a
minimum. As Stephen was saying, the

1278
00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:34.510
minimum. As Stephen was saying, the
collateral damage in so many ways,

1279
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.302
collateral damage in so many ways,
the unintended consequences of

1280
00:35:35.302 --> 00:35:39.260
the unintended consequences of
lockdown are so severe that there

1281
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.260
lockdown are so severe that there
really is a ticking time bomb in

1282
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.510
really is a ticking time bomb in
mental health terms and in Sony

1283
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.427
mental health terms and in Sony
other ways, the impact on our

1284
00:35:48.427 --> 00:35:50.052
other ways, the impact on our
children’s education, that it is not

1285
00:35:50.052 --> 00:35:52.635
children’s education, that it is not
something that we can possibly be

1286
00:35:52.635 --> 00:35:53.635
something that we can possibly be
undertaken lightly. There is one

1287
00:35:53.635 --> 00:35:55.344
undertaken lightly. There is one
other thing I would like to say,

1288
00:35:55.344 --> 00:35:57.427
other thing I would like to say,
which I’m afraid to say is a

1289
00:35:57.427 --> 00:35:58.510
which I’m afraid to say is a
characteristic of this programme, so

1290
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.094
characteristic of this programme, so
there are five of us on the

1291
00:36:01.094 --> 00:36:02.635
there are five of us on the
programme, and I would say four out

1292
00:36:02.635 --> 00:36:04.885
programme, and I would say four out
of the five of us are in the public

1293
00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:06.594
of the five of us are in the public
sector. I am the only one in the

1294
00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:09.010
sector. I am the only one in the
private sector. Actually, in terms

1295
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.594
private sector. Actually, in terms
of the shape of the economy, 85% of

1296
00:36:12.594 --> 00:36:12.885
of the shape of the economy, 5596 of
the people

1297
00:36:12.885 --> 00:36:13.802
of the shape of the economy, 85% of
the people working in the economy

1298
00:36:13.802 --> 00:36:15.927
the people working in the economy
are in the private sector. And no

1299
00:36:15.927 --> 00:36:19.094
are in the private sector. And no
one here today is going to lose

1300
00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:19.260
one here today is going to lose
their

1301
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.510
one here today is going to lose
theirjob because of Covid. But

1302
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.510
theirjob because of Covid. But
believe me, there’s a real risk that

1303
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.677
believe me, there’s a real risk that
millions of people in the private

1304
00:36:24.677 --> 00:36:25.885
millions of people in the private
sector are going to see their

1305
00:36:25.885 --> 00:36:27.385
sector are going to see their
rareers

1306
00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:28.385
sector are going to see their
careers demolished and I think that

1307
00:36:28.385 --> 00:36:33.094
careers demolished and I think that
really matters. People say,

1308
00:36:33.094 --> 00:36:34.510
really matters. People say,
"Economics over lives", but

1309
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.635
"Economics over lives", but
unemployment can kill people and

1310
00:36:35.635 --> 00:36:35.885
unemployment ran kill people and
either get

1311
00:36:35.885 --> 00:36:37.594
unemployment can kill people and
either get needs to be taken into

1312
00:36:37.594 --> 00:36:38.885
either get needs to be taken into
account and also, how are we going

1313
00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:41.469
account and also, how are we going
to pay the £170 billion per year

1314
00:36:41.469 --> 00:36:43.135
to pay the £170 billion per year
that the NHS costs if the economy is

1315
00:36:43.135 --> 00:36:44.844
that the NHS costs if the economy is
in the toilet? I will

1316
00:36:44.844 --> 00:36:45.635
that the NHS costs if the economy is
in the toilet? I willjust say

1317
00:36:45.635 --> 00:36:46.885
in the toilet? I willjust say
because we are a political

1318
00:36:46.885 --> 00:36:49.469
because we are a political
programme, also going to have two or

1319
00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:51.052
programme, also going to have two or
three out of five politicians. But

1320
00:36:51.052 --> 00:36:52.802
three out of five politicians. But
they are public sector. But we are

1321
00:36:52.802 --> 00:36:54.135
they are public sector. But we are
political programme and that is why,

1322
00:36:54.135 --> 00:36:56.344
political programme and that is why,
so do you think we should have had a

1323
00:36:56.344 --> 00:36:58.094
so do you think we should have had a
lockdown at all, then? I think

1324
00:36:58.094 --> 00:36:59.594
lockdown at all, then? I think
Sweden has done all right and time

1325
00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:01.177
Sweden has done all right and time
will tell but I thing they have done

1326
00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:03.635
will tell but I thing they have done
the right and they didn’t have a

1327
00:37:03.635 --> 00:37:05.135
the right and they didn’t have a
lockdown. Well, they say they have

1328
00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:07.302
lockdown. Well, they say they have
had a bit of a lockdown, and their

1329
00:37:07.302 --> 00:37:09.052
had a bit of a lockdown, and their
deaths are higher than Norway, for

1330
00:37:09.052 --> 00:37:12.677
deaths are higher than Norway, for
example. Yes, but lower pro rafter

1331
00:37:12.677 --> 00:37:15.052
example. Yes, but lower pro rafter
than Belgium or Holland. And the

1332
00:37:15.052 --> 00:37:16.885
than Belgium or Holland. And the
effect on the economy in Sweden, the

1333
00:37:16.885 --> 00:37:19.302
effect on the economy in Sweden, the
central bank today said they thought

1334
00:37:19.302 --> 00:37:24.094
central bank today said they thought
the economy could retract by between

1335
00:37:24.094 --> 00:37:25.927
the economy could retract by between
six and 9.7%. But it is still not 1A

1336
00:37:25.927 --> 00:37:26.260
six and 9.796. But it is still not 14
which is

1337
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.094
six and 9.7%. But it is still not 1A
which is what the Bank of England

1338
00:37:28.094 --> 00:37:28.427
which is what the Bank of England
5575

1339
00:37:28.427 --> 00:37:29.719
which is what the Bank of England
says about ours. I said there

1340
00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:31.719
says about ours. I said there
economy will suffer half as much of

1341
00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:33.802
economy will suffer half as much of
ours and unemployment so far in

1342
00:37:33.802 --> 00:37:37.427
ours and unemployment so far in
terms of the increase there has been

1343
00:37:37.427 --> 00:37:39.010
terms of the increase there has been
minimal. Bridget? The level of debt

1344
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.219
minimal. Bridget? The level of debt
are tragically high and behind each

1345
00:37:41.219 --> 00:37:42.635
are tragically high and behind each
number is a family devastated by

1346
00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:43.969
number is a family devastated by
grief, we supported the government

1347
00:37:43.969 --> 00:37:45.094
grief, we supported the government
going into lockdown, it was the

1348
00:37:45.094 --> 00:37:47.135
going into lockdown, it was the
right thing to do. We have also

1349
00:37:47.135 --> 00:37:48.344
right thing to do. We have also
supported of the government in many

1350
00:37:48.344 --> 00:37:49.760
supported of the government in many
of the measures they have brought

1351
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.010
of the measures they have brought
forward to provide support to

1352
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.135
forward to provide support to
workers and businesses to try to get

1353
00:37:53.135 --> 00:37:54.510
workers and businesses to try to get
through this crisis. In some cases,

1354
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.552
through this crisis. In some cases,
we think there needs to be extra

1355
00:37:56.552 --> 00:37:58.052
we think there needs to be extra
clarity and further changes needed

1356
00:37:58.052 --> 00:38:01.469
clarity and further changes needed
in order for us

1357
00:38:01.469 --> 00:38:02.927
clarity and further changes needed
in orderfor us to... Sorry!

1358
00:38:02.927 --> 00:38:03.635
in order for us to... Sorry!
Classic, a

1359
00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:05.927
in orderfor us to... Sorry!
Classic, 3 phone has gone off! Come

1360
00:38:05.927 --> 00:38:06.844
Classic, a phone has gone off! Come
on, Mick, sort

1361
00:38:06.844 --> 00:38:08.219
Classic, 3 phone has gone off! Come
on, Mick, sort it out! In terms of

1362
00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:10.344
on, Mick, sort it out! In terms of
the question, is the pill worse than

1363
00:38:10.344 --> 00:38:12.510
the question, is the pill worse than
the ill? I don’t accept it is a

1364
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.927
the ill? I don’t accept it is a
choice between saving lives, public

1365
00:38:14.927 --> 00:38:16.427
choice between saving lives, public
health and the economy. The lockdown

1366
00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:19.302
health and the economy. The lockdown
was necessary to save lives. We have

1367
00:38:19.302 --> 00:38:20.469
was necessary to save lives. We have
unfortunately seen we have amongst

1368
00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:22.885
unfortunately seen we have amongst
the highest death rates in Europe.

1369
00:38:22.885 --> 00:38:24.885
the highest death rates in Europe.
That is deeply regrettable and has

1370
00:38:24.885 --> 00:38:26.760
That is deeply regrettable and has
caused grief and heartache for so

1371
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.635
caused grief and heartache for so
many families. That is why it is so

1372
00:38:28.635 --> 00:38:30.052
many families. That is why it is so
important that what comes next is

1373
00:38:30.052 --> 00:38:32.635
important that what comes next is
right, both in terms of testing,

1374
00:38:32.635 --> 00:38:34.010
right, both in terms of testing,
also in social care, where we know

1375
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.719
also in social rare, where we know
testing is not

1376
00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:35.552
also in social care, where we know
testing is not where it should be,

1377
00:38:35.552 --> 00:38:37.177
testing is not where it should be,
that far too many social care

1378
00:38:37.177 --> 00:38:38.177
that far too many social rare
workers

1379
00:38:38.177 --> 00:38:40.719
that far too many social care
workers are not getting access to

1380
00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:42.094
workers are not getting access to
testing. PPE, unfortunately, still

1381
00:38:42.094 --> 00:38:43.635
testing. PPE, unfortunately, still
remains a problem. But there’s a lot

1382
00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:45.010
remains a problem. But there’s a lot
of anxiety around what will come

1383
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.844
of anxiety around what will come
next for the economy which is why we

1384
00:38:46.844 --> 00:38:47.969
next for the economy which is why we
support the government in taking the

1385
00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:49.760
support the government in taking the
steps they have to protect

1386
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.135
support the government in taking the
steps they have to protectjobs and

1387
00:38:50.135 --> 00:38:50.302
steps they have to protect jobs and
living

1388
00:38:50.302 --> 00:38:51.177
steps they have to protectjobs and
living standards and businesses but

1389
00:38:51.177 --> 00:38:52.552
living standards and businesses but
there will now need to be

1390
00:38:52.552 --> 00:38:54.469
there will now need to be
conversation around what happens

1391
00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:56.427
conversation around what happens
next. Yes, job retention but also

1392
00:38:56.427 --> 00:38:58.094
next. Yes, job retention but also
job creation and a plan to get the

1393
00:38:58.094 --> 00:39:00.510
job creation and a plan to get the
economy moving once more. Another

1394
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:03.469
economy moving once more. Another
message has come in from David, "Why

1395
00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:03.885
message has come in from David, "why
wasn’t the

1396
00:39:03.885 --> 00:39:06.677
message has come in from David, "Why
wasn’t the strategy built around the

1397
00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:07.760
wasn’t the strategy built around the
mortality age profile?" This plays

1398
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.635
mortality age profile?" This plays
into what Luke was saying. "Only

1399
00:39:10.635 --> 00:39:12.010
into what Luke was saying. "Only
fellow staff over 50, especially

1400
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.177
fellow staff over 50, especially
males pose quit. Then that would be

1401
00:39:15.177 --> 00:39:17.052
malas pose quit. Then that would be
you!

1402
00:39:17.052 --> 00:39:18.260
males pose quit. Then that would be
you! "They Are twice as likely did

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.885
you! "They Are twice as likely did
at that age goes wet. You would not

1404
00:39:19.885 --> 00:39:21.302
at that age goes wet. You would not
be working at all. "Throw the sink

1409
00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:27.885
times more likely to die at 80 than
20". This is what David is saying so

1410
00:39:27.885 --> 00:39:29.052
20’. This is what David is saying so
I cannot verify

1411
00:39:29.052 --> 00:39:29.969
20". This is what David is saying so
I cannot verify that fact exactly.

1412
00:39:29.969 --> 00:39:31.677
I cannot verify that fact exactly.
Stephen, do you have any sympathy

1413
00:39:31.677 --> 00:39:34.010
Stephen, do you have any sympathy
with what Luke is saying, that there

1414
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.885
with what Luke is saying, that there
should have been a lot done at all?

1415
00:39:35.885 --> 00:39:38.677
should have been a lot done at all?
Know, because I think it was

1416
00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:40.177
Know, because I think it was
important we protected the NHS. We

1417
00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:41.385
important we protected the NHS. We
saw the scenes in countries like

1418
00:39:41.385 --> 00:39:43.260
saw the scenes in countries like
Italy where the health system was

1419
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.760
Italy where the health system was
under massive sustained pressure and

1420
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.760
under massive sustained pressure and
one of the successes so far has been

1421
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.594
one of the successes so far has been
in protecting the NHS and entering

1422
00:39:50.594 --> 00:39:54.260
in protecting the NHS and entering
it has sufficient capacity to meet

1423
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.635
it has sufficient capacity to meet
the number of patients that are

1424
00:39:55.635 --> 00:39:59.177
the number of patients that are
coming in. Coming back to one point

1425
00:39:59.177 --> 00:40:01.302
coming in. Coming back to one point
in Aaron’s question, he says at the

1426
00:40:01.302 --> 00:40:02.927
in Aaron’s question, he says at the
start of the crisis, they were

1427
00:40:02.927 --> 00:40:04.469
start of the crisis, they were
informed mortality rate of 20,000

1428
00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:07.635
informed mortality rate of 20,000
would be a good outcome so that

1429
00:40:07.635 --> 00:40:08.760
would be a good outcome so that
20,000 was predicated over two

1430
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.052
20,000 was predicated over two
years. We are now two months in and

1431
00:40:13.052 --> 00:40:15.510
years. We are now two months in and
our mortality rate is north of

1432
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.635
our mortality rate is north of
30,000. 50 do

1433
00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:17.677
our mortality rate is north of
30,000.50 do you think the

1434
00:40:17.677 --> 00:40:17.885
our mortality rate is north of
30,000. 50 do you think the strategy

1435
00:40:17.885 --> 00:40:18.885
30,000. So do you think the strategy
has been right?

1436
00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:19.844
30,000. 50 do you think the strategy
has been right? The strategy has

1437
00:40:19.844 --> 00:40:21.469
has been right? The strategy has
been right in terms of protecting

1438
00:40:21.469 --> 00:40:24.052
been right in terms of protecting
the NHS. To save lives, not

1439
00:40:24.052 --> 00:40:24.469
been right in terms of protecting
the NHS. To save lives, notjust for

1440
00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:25.469
the NHS. To save lives, not just for
the sake of

1441
00:40:25.469 --> 00:40:26.885
the NHS. To save lives, notjust for
the sake of it. And the capacity in

1442
00:40:26.885 --> 00:40:28.719
the sake of it. And the capacity in
the NHS has enabled us to ensure

1443
00:40:28.719 --> 00:40:30.094
the NHS has enabled us to ensure
that it has not been overwhelmed in

1444
00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.844
that it has not been overwhelmed in
the way that some other countries in

1445
00:40:31.844 --> 00:40:34.052
the way that some other countries in
Europe has been. But Luke’s point

1446
00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:35.885
Europe has been. But Luke’s point
was around the economy and what the

1447
00:40:35.885 --> 00:40:36.177
was around the economy and what the
OBR

1448
00:40:36.177 --> 00:40:36.427
was around the economy and what the
mm and

1449
00:40:36.427 --> 00:40:38.885
was around the economy and what the
OBR and CBI have said, and the Bank

1450
00:40:38.885 --> 00:40:39.635
mm and CBI have said, and the Bank
of England, that

1451
00:40:39.635 --> 00:40:40.219
OBR and CBI have said, and the Bank
of England, that the measures we

1452
00:40:40.219 --> 00:40:42.927
of England, that the measures we
have taken have prevented economic

1453
00:40:42.927 --> 00:40:43.427
have taken have prevented economic
starring, that

1454
00:40:43.427 --> 00:40:44.677
have taken have prevented economic
scarring, that they would have been

1455
00:40:44.677 --> 00:40:44.885
starring, that they would have been
much

1456
00:40:44.885 --> 00:40:46.052
scarring, that they would have been
much more severe economic

1457
00:40:46.052 --> 00:40:46.844
much more severe economic
consequences, many more

1458
00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:47.385
much more severe economic
consequences, many morejobs

1459
00:40:47.385 --> 00:40:47.844
much more severe economic
consequences, many more jobs lost,

1460
00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:50.427
consequences, many more jobs lost,
if we had not introduced things like

1461
00:40:50.427 --> 00:40:52.135
if we had not introduced things like
the fellow scheme and protecting 7.5

1462
00:40:52.135 --> 00:40:55.885
the fellow scheme and protecting 7.5
million people now at a cost of £10

1463
00:40:55.885 --> 00:40:56.260
million peopla now at a cost of £10
billion, and

1464
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.469
million people now at a cost of £10
billion, and just under a million

1465
00:40:57.469 --> 00:40:59.135
billion, and just under a million
businesses are having their staff

1466
00:40:59.135 --> 00:41:01.260
businesses are having their staff
protected. The measures we put in

1467
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.885
protected. The measures we put in
place with the unemployment support

1468
00:41:02.885 --> 00:41:06.885
place with the unemployment support
scheme on its first day, 440,000

1469
00:41:06.885 --> 00:41:09.052
scheme on its first day, 440,000
applications. We have taken a

1470
00:41:09.052 --> 00:41:10.135
applications. We have taken a
decisive, quick action, to protect

1471
00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:12.969
decisive, quick action, to protect
the economy, because yes, it is

1472
00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:14.344
the economy, because yes, it is
expensive, the measures we are

1473
00:41:14.344 --> 00:41:15.469
expensive, the measures we are
putting in place, but the

1474
00:41:15.469 --> 00:41:16.677
putting in place, but the
alternative of not doing so would

1475
00:41:16.677 --> 00:41:18.927
alternative of not doing so would
have caused much more economic

1476
00:41:18.927 --> 00:41:22.469
have caused much more economic
damage. Mick? Is the Pill worlds

1477
00:41:22.469 --> 00:41:25.844
damage. Mick? Is the Pill worlds
than the ill? That was the question.

1478
00:41:25.844 --> 00:41:27.635
than the ill? That was the question.
I wonder whether we are in a

1479
00:41:27.635 --> 00:41:29.719
I wonder whether we are in a
position where, you know, how we got

1480
00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:31.177
position where, you know, how we got
here in the first place, you know,

1481
00:41:31.177 --> 00:41:35.094
here in the first place, you know,
after ten years of austerity, as a

1482
00:41:35.094 --> 00:41:36.927
after ten years of austerity, as a
country, could we have been better

1483
00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:41.885
country, could we have been better
prepared for this pandemic and

1484
00:41:41.885 --> 00:41:43.260
prepared for this pandemic and
whether or not we should have been

1485
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.594
whether or not we should have been
in the situation that we reacted too

1486
00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:50.219
in the situation that we reacted too
late, was their complacency? Because

1487
00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:52.510
late, was their complacency? Because
some of these questions are material

1488
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.927
some of these questions are material
to actually how we have handled the

1489
00:41:53.927 --> 00:41:58.594
to actually how we have handled the
crisis since. My sense is, no, we

1490
00:41:58.594 --> 00:42:00.010
crisis since. My sense is, no, we
were complacent at the start of it

1491
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:05.469
were complacent at the start of it
and actually, as a country,

1492
00:42:05.469 --> 00:42:07.135
and actually, as a country,
austerity, including the NHS and

1493
00:42:07.135 --> 00:42:07.302
austerity, including the NHS and
rare

1494
00:42:07.302 --> 00:42:09.885
austerity, including the NHS and
care homes, the civil service, some

1495
00:42:09.885 --> 00:42:10.927
rare homes, the civil service, some
of the key

1496
00:42:10.927 --> 00:42:11.927
care homes, the civil service, some
of the key fabrics of this country

1497
00:42:11.927 --> 00:42:12.094
of the key fabric of this country
have

1498
00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:13.427
of the key fabrics of this country
have been damaged, and this has

1499
00:42:13.427 --> 00:42:14.885
have been damaged, and this has
damaged the ability to deal with

1500
00:42:14.885 --> 00:42:16.510
damaged the ability to deal with
this crisis and it is going to

1501
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.260
this crisis and it is going to
damage our ability to get out of

1502
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.969
damage our ability to get out of
this crisis. 50 some of the seeds of

1503
00:42:19.969 --> 00:42:20.344
this crisis. So some of the seeds of
this and

1504
00:42:20.344 --> 00:42:21.469
this crisis. 50 some of the seeds of
this and the reason why we are in

1505
00:42:21.469 --> 00:42:25.719
this and the reason why we are in
trouble go way back and previous

1506
00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:25.885
trouble go way back and previous
decisions

1507
00:42:25.885 --> 00:42:26.052
troubla go way back and previous
decisions by

1508
00:42:26.052 --> 00:42:26.802
trouble go way back and previous
decisions by previous governments,

1509
00:42:26.802 --> 00:42:27.094
decisions by previous governments,
predominantly Conservative

1510
00:42:27.094 --> 00:42:29.010
predominantly Conservative
governments, I have to say and that

1511
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.885
governments, I have to say and that
is why we are in the mess today in

1512
00:42:30.885 --> 00:42:32.760
is why we are in the mess today in
terms of trying to deal with these

1513
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.052
terms of trying to deal with these
issues. We don’t have the fabric,

1514
00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.010
issues. We don’t have the fabric,
the social fabric, the

1515
00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.510
the social fabric, the
infrastructure, that we should have

1516
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.510
infrastmclure, that we should have
had if we

1517
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.969
infrastructure, that we should have
had if we hadn’t had ten years of

1518
00:42:39.969 --> 00:42:41.469
had if we hadn’t had ten years of
austerity. It is actually the

1519
00:42:41.469 --> 00:42:42.969
austerity. It is actually the
opposite, it is because we took the

1520
00:42:42.969 --> 00:42:44.177
opposite, it is because we took the
decisions we did over the last

1521
00:42:44.177 --> 00:42:45.719
decisions we did over the last
decade to get the deficit down...

1522
00:42:45.719 --> 00:42:48.344
decade to get the deficit down...
That is a load of Tosh! That we have

1523
00:42:48.344 --> 00:42:50.219
That is a load of Tosh! That we have
been able to have the level of

1524
00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:52.552
been able to have the level of
borrowing we have to meet the

1525
00:42:52.552 --> 00:42:54.177
borrowing we have to meet the
challenges we face. It is as a

1526
00:42:54.177 --> 00:42:55.427
challenges we face. It is as a
consequence of those decisions that

1527
00:42:55.427 --> 00:42:55.760
consequence of those decisions that
we ran

1528
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.010
consequence of those decisions that
we can step up and put in place

1529
00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:57.177
we ran step up and put in place
schemes

1530
00:42:57.177 --> 00:42:58.844
we can step up and put in place
schemes like the fellow scheme that

1531
00:42:58.844 --> 00:43:00.760
schemes like the fellow scheme that
have protected so many workers. So

1532
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.510
have protected so many workers. So
the fact you

1533
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.844
have protected so many workers. 50
the fact you had to hire so many

1534
00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:04.635
the fact you had to hire so many
more extra nurses and try to get

1535
00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:06.135
more extra nurses and try to get
people coming out of retirement was

1536
00:43:06.135 --> 00:43:09.594
people coming out of retirement was
not a function of the fact... 7

1537
00:43:09.594 --> 00:43:09.969
people coming out of retirement was
not a function of the fact...? It is

1538
00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:10.219
not a function of the fact... ? It is
an

1539
00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:11.260
not a function of the fact...? It is
an unprecedented situation. But

1540
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.844
an unprecedented situation. But
nevertheless, we were down on than

1541
00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:15.427
nevertheless, we were down on than
others, weren’t we? But the fact is

1542
00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:16.844
others, weren’t we? But the fact is
we have done that without NHS

1543
00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:18.260
we have done that without NHS
capacity being exceeded and we have

1544
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.344
capacity being exceeded and we have
met... There was a lot of talk on

1545
00:43:20.344 --> 00:43:21.135
met... There was a lot of talk on
programmes like this about

1546
00:43:21.135 --> 00:43:23.719
programmes like this about
ventilators that the UK was going to

1547
00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:24.802
ventilators that the UK was going to
mn out of,

1548
00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:25.885
ventilators that the UK was going to
run out of, run out of capacity. We

1549
00:43:25.885 --> 00:43:26.260
mn out of, nm out of capacity. We
have been

1550
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.885
run out of, run out of capacity. We
have been able to meet that capacity

1551
00:43:27.885 --> 00:43:29.885
have been able to meet that capacity
but to Mick’s point, it is because

1552
00:43:29.885 --> 00:43:32.885
but to Mick’s point, it is because
of the decisions taken over the last

1553
00:43:32.885 --> 00:43:34.135
of the decisions taken over the last
ten years on the public finances

1554
00:43:34.135 --> 00:43:35.885
ten years on the public finances
that we are now in a position to put

1555
00:43:35.885 --> 00:43:37.177
that we are now in a position to put
in place the economic measures. But

1556
00:43:37.177 --> 00:43:39.844
in place the economic measures. But
for the last ten years, we have also

1557
00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:40.635
for the last ten years, we have also
seen social care consistently

1558
00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:42.094
seen social care consistently
overlooked and that is a problem

1559
00:43:42.094 --> 00:43:44.135
overlooked and that is a problem
now, where we face a real challenge

1560
00:43:44.135 --> 00:43:45.927
now, where we face a real challenge
within our social care sector, not

1561
00:43:45.927 --> 00:43:47.010
within our social rare sector, not
just in

1562
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.510
within our social care sector, not
just in protecting workers, who are

1563
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:49.760
just in protecting workers, who are
doing incredible work looking after

1564
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.427
doing incredible work looking after
some really vulnerable people at

1565
00:43:51.427 --> 00:43:53.135
some really vulnerable people at
this time but also the unacceptably

1566
00:43:53.135 --> 00:43:55.302
this time but also the unacceptably
high death rate we are seeing in

1567
00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:55.469
high death rate we are seeing in
rare

1568
00:43:55.469 --> 00:43:56.927
high death rate we are seeing in
care homes. That comes down to the

1569
00:43:56.927 --> 00:43:57.302
rare homes. That comes down to the
fact we

1570
00:43:57.302 --> 00:43:58.719
care homes. That comes down to the
fact we have not had a proper plan

1571
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:00.802
fact we have not had a proper plan
to resource social care, to train

1572
00:44:00.802 --> 00:44:00.885
to resource social rare, to train
the

1573
00:44:00.885 --> 00:44:02.344
to resource social care, to train
the workforce, and we are still no

1574
00:44:02.344 --> 00:44:03.927
the workforce, and we are still no
closer to seeing that. The decisions

1575
00:44:03.927 --> 00:44:05.594
closer to seeing that. The decisions
that have been taken over the last

1576
00:44:05.594 --> 00:44:07.719
that have been taken over the last
decade have left us ill—prepared for

1577
00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:08.135
decade have left us ill-prepared for
this. We

1578
00:44:08.135 --> 00:44:08.927
decade have left us ill—prepared for
this. We will be constructive in

1579
00:44:08.927 --> 00:44:09.885
this. We will be constructive in
working with the government where

1580
00:44:09.885 --> 00:44:11.885
working with the government where
they get things right but we have to

1581
00:44:11.885 --> 00:44:13.885
they get things right but we have to
be honest around the fact that our

1582
00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:14.052
be honest around the fact that our
pub“:

1583
00:44:14.052 --> 00:44:15.719
be honest around the fact that our
public services were not resilient

1584
00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.844
public services were not resilient
enough and family finances are not

1585
00:44:17.844 --> 00:44:20.219
enough and family finances are not
resilient enough, either. Let me

1586
00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:21.885
resilient enough, either. Let me
bring in Debbie —— bring in Debbie

1587
00:44:21.885 --> 00:44:22.469
bring in Debbie -- bring in Debbie
in Scotland, I

1588
00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:24.052
bring in Debbie —— bring in Debbie
in Scotland, I know in terms of the

1589
00:44:24.052 --> 00:44:26.094
in Scotland, I know in terms of the
question from Erin, I know you

1590
00:44:26.094 --> 00:44:27.885
question from Erin, I know you
support the lockdown and you think

1591
00:44:27.885 --> 00:44:28.969
support the lockdown and you think
it should continue. But you must

1592
00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:31.635
it should continue. But you must
also be concerned about the cost of

1593
00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:32.510
also be concerned about the cost of
the economy, not

1594
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.385
also be concerned about the cost of
the economy, notjust in terms of

1595
00:44:33.385 --> 00:44:34.094
the economy, not just in terms of
jobs, hugely

1596
00:44:34.094 --> 00:44:34.927
the economy, notjust in terms of
jobs, hugely important though that

1597
00:44:34.927 --> 00:44:37.594
jobs, hugely important though that
is but in terms of excess deaths,

1598
00:44:37.594 --> 00:44:40.302
is but in terms of excess deaths,
deaths connected to mental health,

1599
00:44:40.302 --> 00:44:41.385
deaths connected to mental health,
deprivation, because the economy is

1600
00:44:41.385 --> 00:44:44.010
deprivation, because the economy is
suffering? Definitely, I mean, this

1601
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.052
suffering? Definitely, I mean, this
is the stress I felt when we went

1602
00:44:46.052 --> 00:44:48.052
is the stress I felt when we went
into lockdown. I was thinking about

1603
00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.552
into lockdown. I was thinking about
domestic abuse, kids out of school,

1604
00:44:50.552 --> 00:44:52.719
domestic abuse, kids out of school,
going hungry. It is very much, keep

1605
00:44:52.719 --> 00:44:52.885
going hungry. It is very much, keep
pub“:

1606
00:44:52.885 --> 00:44:54.052
going hungry. It is very much, keep
public health researchers up at

1607
00:44:54.052 --> 00:44:55.469
public health researchers up at
night, this is what we wanted to

1608
00:44:55.469 --> 00:44:57.385
night, this is what we wanted to
avoid. I think to understand how we

1609
00:44:57.385 --> 00:44:59.927
avoid. I think to understand how we
got here, we have to go back in

1610
00:44:59.927 --> 00:45:01.719
got here, we have to go back in
time, 31st of December, China

1611
00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:02.719
time, Sist of December, China
notified the World Health

1612
00:45:02.719 --> 00:45:04.094
notified the World Health
Organization of the novel pathogen

1613
00:45:04.094 --> 00:45:05.469
Organization of the novel pathogen
and the clock started and countries

1614
00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.594
and the dock started and countries
could prepare

1615
00:45:06.594 --> 00:45:07.719
and the clock started and countries
could prepare or not. The easiest

1616
00:45:07.719 --> 00:45:09.635
could prepare or not. The easiest
thing to do is nothing. Let the

1617
00:45:09.635 --> 00:45:10.302
thing to do is nothing. Let the
vims mns

1618
00:45:10.302 --> 00:45:12.094
thing to do is nothing. Let the
virus runs through, whoever makes

1619
00:45:12.094 --> 00:45:14.302
virus runs through, whoever makes
it, makes it. The second strategy is

1620
00:45:14.302 --> 00:45:15.885
it, makes it. The second strategy is
used lockdown and release cycles so

1621
00:45:15.885 --> 00:45:17.677
used lockdown and release cycles so
in March because of what was

1622
00:45:17.677 --> 00:45:19.094
in March because of what was
happening in Italy, it seems like we

1623
00:45:19.094 --> 00:45:21.052
happening in Italy, it seems like we
had a sudden change in strategy from

1624
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:22.885
had a sudden change in strategy from
the first to the second, to a

1625
00:45:22.885 --> 00:45:25.260
the first to the second, to a
lockdown. It came very abruptly and

1626
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.635
lockdown. It came very abruptly and
quite suddenly. And now we are

1627
00:45:26.635 --> 00:45:27.802
quite suddenly. And now we are
trying to transition to what many

1628
00:45:27.802 --> 00:45:33.302
trying to transition to what many
countries went to from the start is

1629
00:45:33.302 --> 00:45:34.052
countries went to from the start is
more public health infrastructure,

1630
00:45:34.052 --> 00:45:34.302
more public health infrastmclure,
testing,

1631
00:45:34.302 --> 00:45:35.135
more public health infrastructure,
testing, tracing, isolating. This is

1632
00:45:35.135 --> 00:45:36.510
testing, tracing, isolating. This is
what South Korea has done from the

1633
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.135
what South Korea has done from the
start and this is why they never had

1634
00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:38.719
start and this is why they never had
to shut down

1635
00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:39.552
start and this is why they never had
to shutdown and their death rate

1636
00:45:39.552 --> 00:45:39.885
start and this is why they never had
to shut down and their death rate is

1637
00:45:39.885 --> 00:45:40.677
to shut down and their death rate is
actually in the

1638
00:45:40.677 --> 00:45:41.927
to shutdown and their death rate is
actually in the low hundreds. If we

1639
00:45:41.927 --> 00:45:43.260
actually in the low hundreds. If we
are looking at countries to emulate,

1640
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.969
are looking at countries to emulate,
I would not be looking at Sweden but

1641
00:45:45.969 --> 00:45:48.510
I would not be looking at Sweden but
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,

1642
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.427
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Australia, New Zealand, Norway,

1643
00:45:50.427 --> 00:45:52.677
Australia, New Zealand, Norway,
Denmark, Greece and the list goes

1644
00:45:52.677 --> 00:45:54.385
Denmark, Greece and the list goes
on. OK, I’m going to bring in one

1645
00:45:54.385 --> 00:45:57.552
on. OK, I’m going to bring in one
more question if I can from Bertie.

1646
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:05.469
Hello.

1647
00:46:05.469 --> 00:46:09.469
We’ve all seen the footage
of overcrowded buses and trains

1648
00:46:09.469 --> 00:46:13.010
in London this week and whilst
Covid—19 is a global problem,

1649
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:17.969
its transmission is local.

1650
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.135
Spain and France have
implemented different policies

1651
00:46:20.135 --> 00:46:22.302
for the different regions and cities
of their countries.

1652
00:46:22.302 --> 00:46:27.302
The UK Government says it is always
guided by the science.

1653
00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:30.177
The question is simple,
what scientific evidence

1654
00:46:30.177 --> 00:46:31.260
could have been used

1655
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.510
to conclude that Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland should

1656
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.135
have different policies but London
should have the same as every

1657
00:46:38.135 --> 00:46:39.594
other region and city in England?

1658
00:46:39.594 --> 00:46:44.385
Bertie, do you think they should be
different even within England? Or do

1659
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.344
different even within England? Or do
you think everywhere should be the

1660
00:46:46.344 --> 00:46:47.969
you think everywhere should be the
same? The R rate is different across

1661
00:46:47.969 --> 00:46:50.344
same? The R rate is different across
the whole of England. You could be

1662
00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:50.510
the whola of England. You could be
losing

1663
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.469
the whole of England. You could be
losing hundreds of Londoners to

1664
00:46:51.469 --> 00:46:52.844
losing hundreds of Londoners to
their death and starving businesses

1665
00:46:52.844 --> 00:46:56.094
their death and starving businesses
in areas like Cornwall where the R

1666
00:46:56.094 --> 00:46:57.802
in areas like Cornwall where the R
rate is lower. I don’t think we are

1667
00:46:57.802 --> 00:46:59.802
rate is lower. I don’t think we are
ready to free anyone up yet but we

1668
00:46:59.802 --> 00:47:03.010
ready to free anyone up yet but we
are definitely not ready to free

1669
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.677
are definitely not ready to free
London up. Bridget, is there an

1670
00:47:05.677 --> 00:47:07.677
London up. Bridget, is there an
argument for doing it at different

1671
00:47:07.677 --> 00:47:08.927
argument for doing it at different
rates across England? I understand

1672
00:47:08.927 --> 00:47:10.302
rates across England? I understand
the point Bertie is making but I’m

1673
00:47:10.302 --> 00:47:11.802
the point Bertie is making but I’m
not sure how practical it would be

1674
00:47:11.802 --> 00:47:14.052
not sure how practical it would be
getting that message across to the

1675
00:47:14.052 --> 00:47:16.010
getting that message across to the
public. There is a disproportionate

1676
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.010
public. There is a disproportionate
impact in this in some parts of the

1677
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:18.969
impact in this in some parts of the
country and particular communities.

1678
00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:21.052
country and particular communities.
In my part of the world, far fewer

1679
00:47:21.052 --> 00:47:23.177
In my part of the world, far fewer
people have the ability to work from

1680
00:47:23.177 --> 00:47:23.885
peopla have the ability to work from
home so

1681
00:47:23.885 --> 00:47:25.385
people have the ability to work from
home so that places an additional

1682
00:47:25.385 --> 00:47:27.469
home so that places an additional
burden on people. We have also seen,

1683
00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:29.885
burden on people. We have also seen,
of course, big differences in death

1684
00:47:29.885 --> 00:47:32.427
of course, big differences in death
rates amongst our black and minority

1685
00:47:32.427 --> 00:47:33.677
rates amongst our black and minority
ethnic communities which is a cause

1686
00:47:33.677 --> 00:47:35.052
ethnic communities which is a cause
of real concern and we really have

1687
00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:37.385
of real concern and we really have
to look carefully as we move to the

1688
00:47:37.385 --> 00:47:39.219
to look carefully as we move to the
next phase about whether it is more

1689
00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:41.385
next phase about whether it is more
dangerous in certain environments

1690
00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:44.094
dangerous in certain environments
for some people over and above

1691
00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:44.219
for some peopla over and above
others

1692
00:47:44.219 --> 00:47:45.760
for some people over and above
others and put in steps to keep

1693
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.594
others and put in steps to keep
people are safe as possible. I’m not

1694
00:47:47.594 --> 00:47:48.385
peopla are safe as possible. I’m not
sure it

1695
00:47:48.385 --> 00:47:50.427
people are safe as possible. I’m not
sure it would be possible to suggest

1696
00:47:50.427 --> 00:47:50.760
sure it would be possibla to suggest
what

1697
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.802
sure it would be possible to suggest
what Bertie is suggesting. There are

1698
00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:52.885
what Bertie is suggesting. There are
differences in approach in different

1699
00:47:52.885 --> 00:47:55.219
differences in approach in different
parts of the UK and some of that is

1700
00:47:55.219 --> 00:47:58.844
parts of the UK and some of that is
necessary, but some of it I think is

1701
00:47:58.844 --> 00:48:00.177
necessary, but some of it I think is
unfortunate and I hope the Prime

1702
00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:01.677
unfortunate and I hope the Prime
Minister will seek to bring a

1703
00:48:01.677 --> 00:48:02.677
Minister will seek to bring a
greater national consensus on this

1704
00:48:02.677 --> 00:48:03.552
greater national consensus on this
so we ran

1705
00:48:03.552 --> 00:48:04.802
greater national consensus on this
so we can work together to defeat

1706
00:48:04.802 --> 00:48:05.219
so we ran work together to defeat
the vims.

1707
00:48:05.219 --> 00:48:06.719
so we can work together to defeat
the virus. One thing that would feed

1708
00:48:06.719 --> 00:48:07.552
the vims. One thing that would feed
into what

1709
00:48:07.552 --> 00:48:08.677
the virus. One thing that would feed
into what Bertie is saying, should

1710
00:48:08.677 --> 00:48:09.969
into what Bertie is saying, should
you want to introduce different

1711
00:48:09.969 --> 00:48:11.885
you want to introduce different
easing is of the lockdown in

1712
00:48:11.885 --> 00:48:13.177
easing is of the lockdown in
different parts of the country is

1713
00:48:13.177 --> 00:48:15.219
different parts of the country is
the obviously big test track and

1714
00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:16.677
the obviously big test track and
trace programme the government is

1715
00:48:16.677 --> 00:48:19.385
trace programme the government is
pursuing. Matt Hancock said he would

1716
00:48:19.385 --> 00:48:20.969
pursuing. Matt Hancock said he would
have the test, track and trace

1717
00:48:20.969 --> 00:48:23.094
have the test, track and trace
system in place by the middle of the

1718
00:48:23.094 --> 00:48:25.469
system in place by the middle of the
month. That’s tomorrow, will it be

1719
00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.427
month. That’s tomorrow, will it be
in place tomorrow? He will make a

1720
00:48:27.427 --> 00:48:28.760
in place tomorrow? He will make a
statement to Parliament on that on

1721
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.260
statement to Partiament on that on
Monday and it

1722
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.469
statement to Parliament on that on
Monday and it will roll out next

1723
00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:32.552
Monday and it will roll out next
week. So it will be in place? It

1724
00:48:32.552 --> 00:48:34.594
week. So it will be in place? It
will roll out from next week and the

1725
00:48:34.594 --> 00:48:36.469
will roll out from next week and the
pilot has gone extremely well on the

1726
00:48:36.469 --> 00:48:38.010
pilot has gone extremely well on the
Isle of Wight. One of the questions

1727
00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:39.969
Isle of Wight. One of the questions
asked about the app was whether

1728
00:48:39.969 --> 00:48:40.177
asked about the app was whether
peopla

1729
00:48:40.177 --> 00:48:41.719
asked about the app was whether
people would download it. More than

1730
00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:42.177
peopla would download it. More than
half the

1731
00:48:42.177 --> 00:48:43.594
people would download it. More than
half the people with smartphones on

1732
00:48:43.594 --> 00:48:43.885
half the peopla with smartphones on
the

1733
00:48:43.885 --> 00:48:45.385
half the people with smartphones on
the island have done so. One of the

1734
00:48:45.385 --> 00:48:47.135
the island have done so. One of the
other questions with it was whether

1735
00:48:47.135 --> 00:48:49.385
other questions with it was whether
privacy would be a big constraint,

1736
00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:51.802
privacy would be a big constraint,
and yet in the feedback only 2%

1737
00:48:51.802 --> 00:48:51.969
and yet in the feedback only 296
cited

1738
00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:53.344
and yet in the feedback only 2%
cited privacy because the data is

1739
00:48:53.344 --> 00:48:56.052
cited privacy because the data is
kept on the phone until someone

1740
00:48:56.052 --> 00:48:58.385
kept on the phone until someone
contacts requesting a trace. Just to

1741
00:48:58.385 --> 00:48:58.802
contacts requesting a trace. just to
be clear

1742
00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:00.469
contacts requesting a trace. Just to
be clear what you have told us, is

1743
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:02.927
be clear what you have told us, is
it but next week test, track and

1744
00:49:02.927 --> 00:49:04.344
it but next week test, track and
trace will be rolled out across the

1745
00:49:04.344 --> 00:49:06.177
trace will be rolled out across the
UK, or is it the app that will be

1746
00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:08.677
UK, or is it the app that will be
rolled out? It will be set out in a

1747
00:49:08.677 --> 00:49:10.219
rolled out? It will be set out in a
statement to Parliament, we get

1748
00:49:10.219 --> 00:49:11.010
statement to Parliament, we get
criticised if Parliament doesn’t

1749
00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:11.177
criticised if Partiament doesn’t
hear

1750
00:49:11.177 --> 00:49:13.802
criticised if Parliament doesn’t
hear first...

1751
00:49:13.802 --> 00:49:13.969
criticised if Parliament doesn’t
hearfirst... What

1752
00:49:13.969 --> 00:49:14.094
criticised if Parliament doesn’t
hear first... What is

1753
00:49:14.094 --> 00:49:14.385
criticised if Parliament doesn’t
hearfirst... What is it

1754
00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:14.885
criticised if Parliament doesn’t
hear first... What is it that is

1755
00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:16.010
hear first. . . what is it that is
being rolled

1756
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.927
hear first... What is it that is
being rolled out on Monday? He is

1757
00:49:17.927 --> 00:49:18.844
being rolled out on Monday? He is
making a statement to

1758
00:49:18.844 --> 00:49:19.635
making a statement to
parliamentarians on Monday first

1759
00:49:19.635 --> 00:49:19.844
partiamentarians on Monday first
which

1760
00:49:19.844 --> 00:49:20.927
parliamentarians on Monday first
which is what the speaker has asked

1761
00:49:20.927 --> 00:49:28.510
which is what the speaker has asked
us to do. To the point, the R rate

1762
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:29.844
us to do. To the point, the R rate
is from a huge amount of scientific

1763
00:49:29.844 --> 00:49:32.594
is from a huge amount of scientific
peer review. The tracing app will

1764
00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:34.844
peer review. The tracing app will
enable us in the future to look at

1765
00:49:34.844 --> 00:49:35.094
enabla us in the future to look at
whether

1766
00:49:35.094 --> 00:49:36.260
enable us in the future to look at
whether there are localised impacts.

1767
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.177
whether there are localised impacts.
But we started the show saying we

1768
00:49:39.177 --> 00:49:40.844
But we started the show saying we
need simpler messages. Now what

1769
00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:42.177
need simpler messages. Now what
Bertie is saying in the future we

1770
00:49:42.177 --> 00:49:44.094
Bertie is saying in the future we
will need to be more nuanced, and

1771
00:49:44.094 --> 00:49:45.885
will need to be more nuanced, and
that’s why we do need to trust the

1772
00:49:45.885 --> 00:49:48.510
that’s why we do need to trust the
public. We do need to look at how we

1773
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.510
public. We do need to look at how we
get as many people to download the

1774
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.635
get as many peopla to download the
3PP

1775
00:49:50.635 --> 00:49:50.885
get as many peopla to download the
app as

1776
00:49:50.885 --> 00:49:53.885
get as many people to download the
app as possible. What he is asking

1777
00:49:53.885 --> 00:49:54.385
app as possible. what he is asking
his... That

1778
00:49:54.385 --> 00:49:56.010
app as possible. What he is asking
his... That will enable in future to

1779
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:56.219
his... That will enabla in future to
consider

1780
00:49:56.219 --> 00:49:57.635
his... That will enable in future to
consider what targeted action is

1781
00:49:57.635 --> 00:50:00.427
consider what targeted action is
taken on a much more localised

1782
00:50:00.427 --> 00:50:02.635
taken on a much more localised
basis. That is a possibility in the

1783
00:50:02.635 --> 00:50:04.510
basis. That is a possibility in the
future? Again, it will be subject to

1784
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:05.885
future? Again, it will be subject to
the scientific advice but it is a

1785
00:50:05.885 --> 00:50:08.594
the scientific advice but it is a
possibility of the app that you can

1786
00:50:08.594 --> 00:50:09.052
possibility of the app that you ran
then be

1787
00:50:09.052 --> 00:50:10.135
possibility of the app that you can
then be much quicker to react to

1788
00:50:10.135 --> 00:50:10.302
then be much quicker to react to
ﬂare-ups

1789
00:50:10.302 --> 00:50:12.885
then be much quicker to react to
flare—ups where they do occur and

1790
00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:13.219
ﬂare-ups where they do occur and
have a

1791
00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:14.885
flare—ups where they do occur and
have a more nuanced message to the

1792
00:50:14.885 --> 00:50:15.052
have a more nuanced message to the
pub“:

1793
00:50:15.052 --> 00:50:17.885
have a more nuanced message to the
public as a consequence. Nick? One

1794
00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:20.385
public as a consequence. Nick? One
of the things that has confused our

1795
00:50:20.385 --> 00:50:21.427
of the things that has confused our
members, we operate train services

1796
00:50:21.427 --> 00:50:25.552
members, we operate train services
to Scotland and Wales and all parts

1797
00:50:25.552 --> 00:50:26.219
to Scotland and Walas and all parts
of the great

1798
00:50:26.219 --> 00:50:29.677
to Scotland and Wales and all parts
of the great British Railways. ——

00:50:30.885 --> 00:50:32.385
of the great British Railways. ——
Mick. You’ve got to be careful. They

1801
00:50:32.385 --> 00:50:33.010
Mick. You’ve got to be careful. They
ran be a

1802
00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:33.802
Mick. You’ve got to be careful. They
can be a conduit, 3 way of

1803
00:50:33.802 --> 00:50:33.969
ran be a conduit, a way of
transmitting

1804
00:50:33.969 --> 00:50:37.927
can be a conduit, 3 way of
transmitting the virus. You don’t

1805
00:50:37.927 --> 00:50:38.469
transmitting the vims. You don’t
want one

1806
00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:39.885
transmitting the virus. You don’t
want one arrangement in one part of

1807
00:50:39.885 --> 00:50:41.094
want one arrangement in one part of
the country versus another

1808
00:50:41.094 --> 00:50:42.885
the country versus another
arrangement in another part. We had

1809
00:50:42.885 --> 00:50:44.344
arrangement in another part. We had
a bit of confusion and the

1810
00:50:44.344 --> 00:50:45.594
a bit of confusion and the
conversation we had when the

1811
00:50:45.594 --> 00:50:46.552
conversation we had when the
Scottish Government said you should

1812
00:50:46.552 --> 00:50:49.969
Scottish Government said you should
wear face coverings, face masks,

1813
00:50:49.969 --> 00:50:50.177
Scottish Government said you should
wearface coverings, face masks, and

1814
00:50:50.177 --> 00:50:50.844
wear face coverings, face masks, and
that is

1815
00:50:50.844 --> 00:50:52.010
wearface coverings, face masks, and
that is what they want in Scotland

1816
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.052
that is what they want in Scotland
ahead of what the UK Government were

1817
00:50:54.052 --> 00:50:55.927
ahead of what the UK Government were
saying around England. In Wales was

1818
00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:56.219
saying around England. In Walas was
saying

1819
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.635
saying around England. In Wales was
saying something different. 50 in

1820
00:50:57.635 --> 00:50:57.927
saying something different. So in
all of

1821
00:50:57.927 --> 00:50:59.219
saying something different. 50 in
all of this with her got to remember

1822
00:50:59.219 --> 00:51:02.927
all of this with her got to remember
we are not one nation, when you

1823
00:51:02.927 --> 00:51:04.219
we are not one nation, when you
release the travel and allow people

1824
00:51:04.219 --> 00:51:06.177
release the travel and allow people
to travel more you have to have

1825
00:51:06.177 --> 00:51:11.010
to travel more you have to have
consistency across the whole rail

1826
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.552
consistency across the whole rail
network to allow our members to

1827
00:51:12.552 --> 00:51:14.094
network to allow our members to
understand what to do, as well as

1828
00:51:14.094 --> 00:51:17.010
understand what to do, as well as
passengers. We have got to be very

1829
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.594
passengers. We have got to be very
careful in trying to have different

1830
00:51:18.594 --> 00:51:20.219
careful in trying to have different
arrangements for different parts of

1831
00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:21.885
arrangements for different parts of
the country. It could spread or

1832
00:51:21.885 --> 00:51:24.885
the country. It could spread or
otherwise. Are you as a union

1833
00:51:24.885 --> 00:51:26.885
otherwise. Are you as a union
recommending that all of your

1834
00:51:26.885 --> 00:51:27.927
recommending that all of your
members wear

1835
00:51:27.927 --> 00:51:28.469
recommending that all of your
members wearface

1836
00:51:28.469 --> 00:51:28.969
recommending that all of your
members wear face coverings at work?

1837
00:51:28.969 --> 00:51:30.677
members wear face coverings at work?
We are in a position where we are

1838
00:51:30.677 --> 00:51:32.594
We are in a position where we are
saying we believe it would be

1839
00:51:32.594 --> 00:51:34.510
saying we believe it would be
beneficial for passengers, the users

1840
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.760
beneficial for passengers, the users
of the services, as part of the

1841
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.302
of the services, as part of the
protections to wear a face mask. I

1842
00:51:39.302 --> 00:51:40.719
protections to wear a face mask. I
appreciate you cannot compel them to

1843
00:51:40.719 --> 00:51:42.927
appreciate you cannot compel them to
do so but I’m wondering about your

1844
00:51:42.927 --> 00:51:46.510
do so but I’m wondering about your
members. Members have different

1845
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:48.302
members. Members have different
activities and we are seeking to get

1846
00:51:48.302 --> 00:51:49.094
activities and we are seeking to get
them to her face

1847
00:51:49.094 --> 00:51:49.510
activities and we are seeking to get
them to herface masks and

1848
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.885
activities and we are seeking to get
them to her face masks and visors to

1849
00:51:49.885 --> 00:51:54.844
them to her face masks and visors to
protect themselves. Some of the

1850
00:51:54.844 --> 00:51:57.469
protect themselves. Some of the
so—called PPE, as it’s called, face

1851
00:51:57.469 --> 00:51:57.802
so-ralled PPE, as it’s called, face
coverings, for

1852
00:51:57.802 --> 00:51:59.052
so—called PPE, as it’s called, face
coverings, for example, doesn’t

1853
00:51:59.052 --> 00:52:00.469
coverings, for example, doesn’t
protect the individual, it stops

1854
00:52:00.469 --> 00:52:02.219
protect the individual, it stops
transmission, which is not what PPE

1855
00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:04.094
transmission, which is not what PPE
in itself is meant for, personal

1856
00:52:04.094 --> 00:52:06.510
in itself is meant for, personal
protective equipment. In Scotland

1857
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:09.844
protective equipment. In Scotland
you are in a different position,

1858
00:52:09.844 --> 00:52:11.760
you are in a different position,
Devi, or it has been fractionally in

1859
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.177
Devi, or it has been fractionally in
terms of exercise. Coming to

1860
00:52:15.177 --> 00:52:15.594
terms of exercise. Coming to
Bertie’s

1861
00:52:15.594 --> 00:52:16.635
terms of exercise. Coming to
Bertie’s question in terms of having

1862
00:52:16.635 --> 00:52:18.427
Bertie’s question in terms of having
different easing is of the lockdown

1863
00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:20.427
different easing is of the lockdown
in different regions, or even small

1864
00:52:20.427 --> 00:52:21.927
in different regions, or even small
areas, does that strike you as a

1865
00:52:21.927 --> 00:52:25.177
areas, does that strike you as a
good idea? Definitely. This is what

1866
00:52:25.177 --> 00:52:26.719
good idea? Definitely. This is what
I’ve been saying from the beginning,

1867
00:52:26.719 --> 00:52:28.469
I’ve been saying from the beginning,
that we need to be working at

1868
00:52:28.469 --> 00:52:29.552
that we need to be working at
community level and seeing

1869
00:52:29.552 --> 00:52:31.052
community level and seeing
transmission and making sure that

1870
00:52:31.052 --> 00:52:35.010
transmission and making sure that
the economy since society is running

1871
00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:35.135
the economy since society is mnning
where

1872
00:52:35.135 --> 00:52:36.260
the economy since society is running
where transmission is low and where

1873
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.052
where transmission is low and where
it is high we try and get a handle

1874
00:52:38.052 --> 00:52:38.635
it is high we try and get a handla
on it. To

1875
00:52:38.635 --> 00:52:39.677
it is high we try and get a handle
on it. To come back to the phrase

1876
00:52:39.677 --> 00:52:40.760
on it. To come back to the phrase
following the signs, the thing I

1877
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.177
following the signs, the thing I
want to

1878
00:52:41.177 --> 00:52:41.469
following the signs, the thing I
we nt to clarify

1879
00:52:41.469 --> 00:52:43.510
following the signs, the thing I
want to clarify as there is no

1880
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.510
want to clarify as there is no
English science, Scottish science,

1881
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:46.594
English science, Scottish science,
German science and Korean science.

1882
00:52:46.594 --> 00:52:48.927
German science and Korean science.
Science is global, we have the same

1883
00:52:48.927 --> 00:52:50.219
Science is global, we have the same
information here among our

1884
00:52:50.219 --> 00:52:51.385
information here among our
scientists as others in other

1885
00:52:51.385 --> 00:52:52.885
scientists as others in other
countries because we are working

1886
00:52:52.885 --> 00:52:54.427
countries because we are working
together as a global community. Why

1887
00:52:54.427 --> 00:52:55.010
together as a global community. why
do you think

1888
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.969
together as a global community. Why
do you think you are coming to a

1889
00:52:55.969 --> 00:52:57.594
do you think you are coming to a
different conclusion in Scotland

1890
00:52:57.594 --> 00:52:58.927
different conclusion in Scotland
than the government in England?

1891
00:52:58.927 --> 00:53:00.260
than the government in England?
Because they are political

1892
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.302
Because they are political
decisions. For example, on the issue

1893
00:53:02.302 --> 00:53:03.885
decisions. For example, on the issue
of schools, we can present in

1894
00:53:03.885 --> 00:53:05.510
of schools, we can present in
Scotland what we know as the

1895
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.177
Scotland what we know as the
information on schools, we know

1896
00:53:07.177 --> 00:53:08.427
information on schools, we know
children can transmit the virus, to

1897
00:53:08.427 --> 00:53:08.885
children ran transmit the virus, to
a certain

1898
00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.135
children can transmit the virus, to
a certain extent they are carriers,

1899
00:53:10.135 --> 00:53:12.260
a certain extent they are carriers,
we are unsure of the degree, most

1900
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.844
we are unsure of the degree, most
have mild symptoms, a few rare cases

1901
00:53:15.844 --> 00:53:16.010
have mild symptoms, a few rare rases
children

1902
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.885
have mild symptoms, a few rare cases
children suffer severe symptoms a

1903
00:53:16.885 --> 00:53:18.302
children suffer severe symptoms a
few weeks later, that’s what we know

1904
00:53:18.302 --> 00:53:19.927
few weeks later, that’s what we know
and what we can present. Political

1905
00:53:19.927 --> 00:53:20.135
and what we ran present. Political
leaders

1906
00:53:20.135 --> 00:53:21.469
and what we can present. Political
leaders have to weigh that against

1907
00:53:21.469 --> 00:53:22.885
leaders have to weigh that against
the educational benefit, the kids

1908
00:53:22.885 --> 00:53:24.677
the educational benefit, the kids
going back against the economic

1909
00:53:24.677 --> 00:53:25.635
going back against the economic
effects, having working parents

1910
00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:27.385
effects, having working parents
going back, and looking at the

1911
00:53:27.385 --> 00:53:28.469
going back, and looking at the
consequences of the infection

1912
00:53:28.469 --> 00:53:29.260
consequences of the infection
spreading wider. We can

1913
00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:29.469
consequences of the infection
spreading wider. We canjust

1914
00:53:29.469 --> 00:53:29.760
consequences of the infection
spreading wider. We can just present

1915
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:29.927
spreading wider. We ranjust present
the

1916
00:53:29.927 --> 00:53:31.302
spreading wider. We can just present
the evidence and they have to make a

1917
00:53:31.302 --> 00:53:34.219
the evidence and they have to make a
decision what to do with it. Bertie,

1918
00:53:34.219 --> 00:53:36.094
decision what to do with it. Bertie,
I ran see you

1919
00:53:36.094 --> 00:53:36.844
decision what to do with it. Bertie,
I can see you nodding away. I

1920
00:53:36.844 --> 00:53:37.635
I ran see you nodding away. I
totally agree

1921
00:53:37.635 --> 00:53:39.260
I can see you nodding away. I
totally agree with that. On

1922
00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.427
totally agree with that. On
Stephen’s point, we have seen in

1923
00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:44.135
Stephen’s point, we have seen in
China the quarantining of different

1924
00:53:44.135 --> 00:53:45.510
China the quarantining of different
regions, provinces, are you saying

1925
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:46.635
regions, provinces, are you saying
the British people aren’t

1926
00:53:46.635 --> 00:53:48.010
the British people aren’t
intelligent enough to understand

1927
00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:49.469
intelligent enough to understand
that London is different to other

1928
00:53:49.469 --> 00:53:52.885
that London is different to other
areas of the country? My point was

1929
00:53:52.885 --> 00:53:55.427
areas of the country? My point was
that we can be more nuanced in the

1930
00:53:55.427 --> 00:53:55.885
that we ran be more nuanced in the
messaging,

1931
00:53:55.885 --> 00:53:57.219
that we can be more nuanced in the
messaging, quite the opposite point.

1932
00:53:57.219 --> 00:54:00.385
messaging, quite the opposite point.
In that simple message, are you not

1933
00:54:00.385 --> 00:54:01.885
In that simple message, are you not
leading to the deaths of hundreds of

1934
00:54:01.885 --> 00:54:04.344
leading to the deaths of hundreds of
Londoners who live in a world of

1935
00:54:04.344 --> 00:54:04.635
Londoners who live in a world of
pub“:

1936
00:54:04.635 --> 00:54:05.469
Londoners who live in a world of
public transport and driving out

1937
00:54:05.469 --> 00:54:06.802
public transport and driving out
loads of businesses that are in an

1938
00:54:06.802 --> 00:54:09.802
loads of businesses that are in an
area where the R rate is further

1939
00:54:09.802 --> 00:54:12.802
area where the R rate is further
down? In London the R rate, as I

1940
00:54:12.802 --> 00:54:14.552
down? In London the R rate, as I
understand it, is pretty low.

1941
00:54:14.552 --> 00:54:15.885
understand it, is pretty low.
Obviously we started much higher but

1942
00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:18.385
Obviously we started much higher but
at the moment it is pretty low. But

1943
00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:20.719
at the moment it is pretty low. But
it wasn’t when the outbreak began.

1944
00:54:20.719 --> 00:54:22.635
it wasn’t when the outbreak began.
If we are going back to a system

1945
00:54:22.635 --> 00:54:25.344
If we are going back to a system
that’s similar to when the outbreak

1946
00:54:25.344 --> 00:54:28.677
that’s similar to when the outbreak
was, that R will go back up. We can

1947
00:54:28.677 --> 00:54:29.219
was, that R will go back up. We ran
dearty see

1948
00:54:29.219 --> 00:54:30.302
was, that R will go back up. We can
clearly see there is more contact in

1949
00:54:30.302 --> 00:54:30.510
dearty see there is more contact in
London

1950
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.427
clearly see there is more contact in
London than in other regions of the

1951
00:54:32.427 --> 00:54:34.635
London than in other regions of the
country. That’s what caused the

1952
00:54:34.635 --> 00:54:35.719
country. That’s what caused the
higher critical care bed percentage,

1953
00:54:35.719 --> 00:54:36.010
higher critical rare bed percentage,
the higher

1954
00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:41.802
higher critical care bed percentage,
the higher number of deaths. Luke? I

1955
00:54:41.802 --> 00:54:42.802
the higher number of deaths. Luke? I
think the government has an

1956
00:54:42.802 --> 00:54:45.219
think the government has an
impossible task and they will never

1957
00:54:45.219 --> 00:54:46.927
impossible task and they will never
please everyone. The messaging, as

1958
00:54:46.927 --> 00:54:48.177
please everyone. The messaging, as
Stephen said, is very difficult to

1959
00:54:48.177 --> 00:54:51.427
Stephen said, is very difficult to
get across well. I think that the

1960
00:54:51.427 --> 00:54:53.677
get across well. I think that the
more complicated you make it by

1961
00:54:53.677 --> 00:54:55.760
more complicated you make it by
dividing up the country and region

1962
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.135
dividing up the country and region
is, of even England, then the harder

1963
00:54:57.135 --> 00:55:01.010
is, of even England, then the harder
it is going to be to get compliance.

1964
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:04.844
it is going to be to get compliance.
Bringing in the example of China

1965
00:55:04.844 --> 00:55:06.552
Bringing in the example of China
locking down regions, China is a

1966
00:55:06.552 --> 00:55:07.844
locking down regions, China is a
communist dictatorship. They can

1967
00:55:07.844 --> 00:55:09.135
communist dictatorship. They can
lockdown whoever they want and they

1968
00:55:09.135 --> 00:55:11.385
lockdown whoever they want and they
bring in the military to do it, so

1969
00:55:11.385 --> 00:55:11.719
lockdown whoever they want and they
bring in the military to do it, sol

1970
00:55:11.719 --> 00:55:12.719
bring in the military to do it, so I
think we

1971
00:55:12.719 --> 00:55:14.594
bring in the military to do it, sol
think we are not a comparable

1972
00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:15.177
think we are not a comparabla
society.

1973
00:55:15.177 --> 00:55:16.635
think we are not a comparable
society. We are a civilised

1974
00:55:16.635 --> 00:55:17.677
society. We are a civilised
democracy, and therefore I don’t

1975
00:55:17.677 --> 00:55:20.052
democracy, and therefore I don’t
think we can adopt the same sort of

1976
00:55:20.052 --> 00:55:20.719
think we ran adopt the same sort of
methods they

1977
00:55:20.719 --> 00:55:23.177
think we can adopt the same sort of
methods they use in China and it’s

1978
00:55:23.177 --> 00:55:25.385
methods they use in China and it’s
not relevant. Yes, I mean, in China,

1979
00:55:25.385 --> 00:55:27.594
not relevant. Yes, I mean, in China,
they kind of sealed people in their

1980
00:55:27.594 --> 00:55:30.260
they kind of sealed people in their
homes. Yes, is that what we want? As

1981
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.677
homes. Yes, is that what we want? As
it is we have given up more

1982
00:55:31.677 --> 00:55:33.469
it is we have given up more
liberties than ever in the history

1983
00:55:33.469 --> 00:55:35.135
liberties than ever in the history
of this country over this lockdown.

1984
00:55:35.135 --> 00:55:37.177
of this country over this lockdown.
We shouldn’t forget that, that we

1985
00:55:37.177 --> 00:55:41.052
We shouldn’t forget that, that we
are a free society and the way in

1986
00:55:41.052 --> 00:55:42.760
are a free society and the way in
which we waved our rights so that we

1987
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760
which we waved our rights so that we
are effectively under house arrest

1988
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.177
are effectively under house arrest
as a nation should not be taken

1989
00:55:45.177 --> 00:55:46.802
as a nation should not be taken
lightly. Given that you are so

1990
00:55:46.802 --> 00:55:48.760
lightly. Given that you are so
unhappy with the lockdown as it is,

1991
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.885
unhappy with the lockdown as it is,
can’t you see any merit in using it

1992
00:55:50.885 --> 00:55:52.844
can’t you see any merit in using it
more in some places in blessing

1993
00:55:52.844 --> 00:55:53.760
more in some places in blassing
others?

1994
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.844
more in some places in blessing
others? It might have merit, yeah. I

1995
00:55:56.844 --> 00:55:58.219
others? It might have merit, yeah. I
think it’s complicated. It is likely

1996
00:55:58.219 --> 00:55:59.927
think it’s complicated. It is likely
what is coming down the track, is

1997
00:55:59.927 --> 00:56:02.469
what is coming down the track, is
it, Stephen? What I’m saying is one

1998
00:56:02.469 --> 00:56:03.094
it, Stephen? what I’m saying is one
of the things

1999
00:56:03.094 --> 00:56:03.927
it, Stephen? What I’m saying is one
of the things the tracing app will

2000
00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:04.010
of the things the tracing app will
enabla

2001
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.677
of the things the tracing app will
enable us to do is to react much

2002
00:56:05.677 --> 00:56:07.260
enabla us to do is to react much
more quickly to

2003
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.135
enable us to do is to react much
more quickly to where there are any

2004
00:56:08.135 --> 00:56:10.469
more quickly to where there are any
potential spikes in infection and

2005
00:56:10.469 --> 00:56:12.344
potential spikes in infection and
have much better data so we can get

2006
00:56:12.344 --> 00:56:13.260
have much better data so we ran get
the testing in

2007
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.094
have much better data so we can get
the testing in quickly and we can

2008
00:56:14.094 --> 00:56:14.594
the testing in quickly and we ran
respond

2009
00:56:14.594 --> 00:56:15.427
the testing in quickly and we can
respond quickly to those measures,

2010
00:56:15.427 --> 00:56:17.177
respond quickly to those measures,
and that’s why it is so important we

2011
00:56:17.177 --> 00:56:19.635
and that’s why it is so important we
get as many people downloading that

2012
00:56:19.635 --> 00:56:20.635
get as many peopla downloading that
app. It has

2013
00:56:20.635 --> 00:56:21.385
get as many people downloading that
app. It has been successful in the

2014
00:56:21.385 --> 00:56:22.010
app. It has been successful in the
Isle of Wight

2015
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.219
app. It has been successful in the
Isle of Night in

2016
00:56:22.219 --> 00:56:22.969
app. It has been successful in the
Isle of Wight in terms of the number

2017
00:56:22.969 --> 00:56:23.635
Isle of Night in terms of the number
of people will

2018
00:56:23.635 --> 00:56:25.260
Isle of Wight in terms of the number
of people will stop and as it is

2019
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:25.469
of peopla will stop and as it is
rolled

2020
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:27.260
of people will stop and as it is
rolled out more widely, we need as

2021
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.427
rolled out more widely, we need as
many people to download it. Did you

2022
00:56:29.427 --> 00:56:30.094
many peopla to download it. Did you
say half the

2023
00:56:30.094 --> 00:56:31.010
many people to download it. Did you
say half the population in the Isle

2024
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.177
say half the population in the Isla
of Wight?

2025
00:56:32.177 --> 00:56:34.344
say half the population in the Isle
of Wight? Just over half of those

2026
00:56:34.344 --> 00:56:34.510
of Wight? just over half of those
with

2027
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.344
of Wight? Just over half of those
with smartphones. You need about 60%

2028
00:56:36.344 --> 00:56:36.802
with smartphones. You need about 6096
to be

2029
00:56:36.802 --> 00:56:37.594
with smartphones. You need about 60%
to be successful, has it reached

2030
00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:41.135
to be successful, has it reached
about? The data is useful whatever

2031
00:56:41.135 --> 00:56:44.344
about? The data is useful whatever
percentage it is. But the Department

2032
00:56:44.344 --> 00:56:46.135
percentage it is. But the Department
of Health, as I say, will do a

2033
00:56:46.135 --> 00:56:47.344
of Health, as I say, will do a
further statement on it on Monday

2034
00:56:47.344 --> 00:56:49.510
further statement on it on Monday
and will set out where the pilot has

2035
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.135
and will set out where the pilot has
got. But the reports that I’ve had

2036
00:56:51.135 --> 00:56:52.844
got. But the reports that I’ve had
is that more than half of the

2037
00:56:52.844 --> 00:56:55.177
is that more than half of the
population have downloaded the app.

2038
00:56:55.177 --> 00:56:56.927
population have downloaded the app.
Maybe we will all be downloading the

2039
00:56:56.927 --> 00:56:57.094
Maybe we will all be downloading the
3PP

2040
00:56:57.094 --> 00:56:59.260
Maybe we will all be downloading the
app at some point. We shall see.

2041
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.052
app at some point. We shall see.
Bertie, thank you for your question

2042
00:57:01.052 --> 00:57:03.427
Bertie, thank you for your question

00:57:43.594 --> 00:57:45.635
question or got in touch via social

2070
00:57:45.635 --> 00:57:48.010
media with the programme. But for
now, until next week, from Question

2071
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:53.510
now, until next week, from Question
Time, bye-bye.

2072
00:58:15.885 --> 00:58:18.885
One day, I will tell you
there are no new cases.

2073
00:58:18.885 --> 00:58:21.969
And I’ll read that the Nightingale
is closing down.

2074
00:58:21.969 --> 00:58:25.552
We’ll take time to reflect
and remember those lives lost.

2075
00:58:25.552 --> 00:58:27.885
And we’ll hug our loved ones.

2076
00:58:27.885 --> 00:58:29.635
Our kids will play
with their friends

2077
00:58:29.635 --> 00:58:31.469
and finally go back to school.

2078
00:58:31.469 --> 00:58:33.344
Sport will return...

2079
00:58:33.344 --> 00:58:34.969
..whether you like it or not.

2080
00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:39.094
Cafes, shops and cinemas
will open their doors.

2081
00:58:39.094 --> 00:58:42.885
One day, plans will be made,
and kept.

2082
00:58:42.885 --> 00:58:45.344
And, until then, we’ll be here

2083
00:58:45.344 --> 00:58:47.719
to help you understand
what’s happening,

2084
00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:49.177
every step of the way.

2085
00:58:55.635 --> 00:58:57.552
Things are a bit different
right now.

2086
00:58:57.552 --> 00:58:58.760
This...

2087
00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.719
..now looks more like this.

2088
00:59:00.719 --> 00:59:02.969
Teaching isn’tjust
a job for them,

2089
00:59:02.969 --> 00:59:04.385
but for you, as well.

2090
00:59:04.385 --> 00:59:07.760
We know it’s not easy,
so we had an idea.

2091
00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.385
BBC Bitesize Daily
is a learning programme

2092
00:59:10.385 --> 00:59:12.344
designed to help support you,

2093
00:59:12.344 --> 00:59:14.969
and to ensure
they don’t stop learning,

2094
00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:16.802
no matter their age.

2095
00:59:16.802 --> 00:59:18.510
The world may be on hold,

2096
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.719
but your child’s education
doesn’t have to be.

2097
00:59:25.469 --> 00:59:27.344
Just tell me you’re ashamed of me.

2098
00:59:27.344 --> 00:59:29.469
I could never be ashamed of you.

2099
00:59:29.469 --> 00:59:31.094
Is yours done yet? Mine is.

2100
00:59:31.094 --> 00:59:33.927
I don’t want to bring someone into
Joe’s life without asking you first.

2101
00:59:33.927 --> 00:59:36.802
But I’m already thinking, "How long
till he starts calling him Dad"?

2102
00:59:36.802 --> 00:59:38.510
He loves you. Anyone can see that.

2103
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:40.094
Brand—new The A Word continues...

2104
01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:06.344
Well, visual evidence is emerging
how different parts of the world

2105
01:00:06.344 --> 01:00:09.719
are coping with life now.

2106
01:00:09.719 --> 01:00:10.969
Yeah, it is.

2107
01:00:10.969 --> 01:00:12.760
I’ve sent some of them to you.

2108
01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.844
0h, have you?
Yeah.

2109
01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.010
Let me have a look.

2110
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.260
So, look at your phone.

2111
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:22.302
Exhibit A, this is Five
Dock Dining in Sydney.

2112
01:00:23.094 --> 01:00:24.760
Having a drdink with
a cardboard cutout.

2113
01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.844
Yeah.
0K.

2114
01:00:25.844 --> 01:00:28.177
It’s an Italian restaurant
and they fit cardboard cut out

2115
01:00:28.177 --> 01:00:30.094
at the empty tables,
so the restaurant feels

2116
01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:31.135
a bit less empty.

2117
01:00:31.135 --> 01:00:35.135
I’ve had less chatty dinner
companions in my time.

2118
01:00:35.135 --> 01:00:36.344
LAUGHING.

2119
01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:38.969
What are they having for dessert?
They are cheap dates, huh?

2120
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.010
Exactly.

2121
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.219
Apparently, they are going
to play tapes of chatter,

2122
01:00:42.219 --> 01:00:44.094
so that it sounds lass empty.
Oh, no.

2123
01:00:44.094 --> 01:00:47.094
Oh, that’s dire, isn’t it?

2124
01:00:47.094 --> 01:00:49.010
Then, Exhibit B, you
might’ve seen this one.

2125
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:51.219
It’s been very prominent
this week, This a vegan

2126
01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:53.385
restaurant in Amsterdam,
where you have a four—course vegan

2127
01:00:53.385 --> 01:00:54.427
meal in a greenhouse.

2128
01:00:54.427 --> 01:00:55.510
Yeah.

2129
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:57.260
Socially distanct from
all the other diners.

2130
01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.219
Suddenly, staying at home
doesn’t seem too bad.

2131
01:00:59.219 --> 01:01:02.344
Yeah, although...
That could be quite nice, actually.

2132
01:01:02.344 --> 01:01:05.427
You know what it’s like when you go
for a romantic meal, though,

2133
01:01:05.427 --> 01:01:08.094
and you’re, like nudging elbows
with the couple next to you.

2134
01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:09.135
That’s true.

2135
01:01:09.135 --> 01:01:11.510
It ruins it, so this is quite good.
That’s tme.

2136
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:14.385
And as you get older,
"It’s very loud in here, isn’t it?"

2137
01:01:14.385 --> 01:01:15.969
Exactly!
It’s not just me, then.

2138
01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:19.885
And then this one, I’m not convinced
this last one is real.

2139
01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:23.219
In the week that pubs remain shut,
but garden centres opened...

2140
01:01:23.219 --> 01:01:24.594
Well, it’s innovative.

2141
01:01:24.594 --> 01:01:26.510
It’s a pub rebranded
as a garden centre.

2142
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:28.094
Amazing.

2143
01:01:28.094 --> 01:01:31.302
What will they think of next?
Who knows.

2144
01:01:31.302 --> 01:01:35.385
Yeah, so, pop down to the garden
centre slash Speakeasy.

2145
01:01:35.385 --> 01:01:38.510
Not that I’ve seen, but if there is,
we will obviously bring it

2146
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.969
to you on the Coronavirus Newscast.

2147
01:01:39.969 --> 01:01:41.635
And disapprove of it.

2148
01:01:41.635 --> 01:01:44.677
But something coming up
that we do approve of,

2149
01:01:44.677 --> 01:01:47.510
it’s the singer who has stolen
the nation’s hearts with her Friday

2150
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.552
night kitchen sing—along.

2151
01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:50.135
Sophia Ellis-Bextor is coming on!
Yes!

2152
01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:53.385
This is very, very exciting.

2153
01:01:53.385 --> 01:01:56.802
In this episode of the
Coronavirus Newscast.

2154
01:01:56.802 --> 01:02:01.844
The Coronavirus Newscast
from the BBC.

2155
01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.094
Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

2156
01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:06.760
And Laura in the same studio,
although two metres apart.

2157
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.760
And Chris in a different studio
about 20 yards down the corridor,

2158
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.594
doing the tourist thing of trying
to prop up the Big Ben

2159
01:02:13.594 --> 01:02:14.677
thing behind me.

2160
01:02:14.677 --> 01:02:15.719
Oh.
Oh.

2161
01:02:15.719 --> 01:02:17.552
That’s nice.

2162
01:02:17.552 --> 01:02:22.552
It is Fergus in Studio 620
in New Broadcasting House.

2163
01:02:22.552 --> 01:02:27.510
What have you got behind you?
I’ve got a coronavirus Newscast ad.

2164
01:02:28.677 --> 01:02:30.427
0h, amazing.

2165
01:02:30.427 --> 01:02:34.635
It’s the Coronavirus
Newscast Zoom background.

2166
01:02:34.635 --> 01:02:36.302
Yes, the brand, which
is actually available.

2167
01:02:36.302 --> 01:02:37.594
Available, what?

2168
01:02:37.594 --> 01:02:39.510
Is it?
Yeah.

2169
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:41.677
We have released a virtual
background for your conference

2170
01:02:41.677 --> 01:02:44.094
calling software that looks
like you are in the studio

2171
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.010
and you even have Deano
over your shoulder.

2172
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:47.677
No!
just like in the old days.

2173
01:02:47.677 --> 01:02:50.594
Send me the link, I’m
going to use it at all times.

2174
01:02:50.594 --> 01:02:52.010
Who needs the Golden Gate Bridge?

2175
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:54.177
Now, there’s lot of medical
and science stuff to

2176
01:02:54.177 --> 01:02:55.219
get through tonight.
Yes.

2177
01:02:55.219 --> 01:02:57.135
So we are joined by
an actual professor,

2178
01:02:57.135 --> 01:02:58.177
it’s Professor Tom Solomon.

2179
01:02:58.177 --> 01:02:59.594
Hello, Tom.
Hi, hi.

2180
01:02:59.594 --> 01:03:01.844
And he’s...

2181
01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.010
My background is my kids,
if you are wondering.

2182
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:05.927
0h, welcome!

2183
01:03:05.927 --> 01:03:09.094
And your professional background
is you are director of the UK’s

2184
01:03:09.094 --> 01:03:11.177
emerging infections research unit
at the University of Liverpool,

2185
01:03:11.177 --> 01:03:12.885
and you are a front line doctor.

2186
01:03:12.885 --> 01:03:16.219
What do you do on the front line?

2187
01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:19.052
Well, I am a neurologist,
so in the past, I’ve mostly focused

2188
01:03:19.052 --> 01:03:22.260
on patients with neurological
problems, and especially those

2189
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.760
with neurological infections
which is one of my research areas,

2190
01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.052
but in recent weeks,
like everybody else,

2191
01:03:27.052 --> 01:03:32.052
I’ve been seeing lots of patients
with coronavirus infections.

2192
01:03:32.594 --> 01:03:34.969
OK, now, Fergus, we’ve got
lots of numbers to crunch

2193
01:03:34.969 --> 01:03:38.885
today because the Office
for National Statistics

2194
01:03:38.885 --> 01:03:41.510
published their first pass on this
big survey they are doing

2195
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.635
of households in England
which will take a snapshot

2196
01:03:43.635 --> 01:03:45.344
of the coronavirus situation
at that point.

2197
01:03:45.344 --> 01:03:46.802
They published the first one today.

2198
01:03:46.802 --> 01:03:48.969
What did it tell us?

2199
01:03:48.969 --> 01:03:53.927
So, they surveyed 11,000
people and they estimate,

2200
01:03:54.969 --> 01:03:59.385
give or take a few tens
of thousands, that around 150,000

2201
01:03:59.385 --> 01:04:04.427
people in England at the moment
currently have coronavirus.

2202
01:04:05.385 --> 01:04:10.302
That is based on swab test results.

2203
01:04:10.302 --> 01:04:15.177
Now, that works out very, very
roughly at about one in 400 people.

2204
01:04:15.177 --> 01:04:20.135
That’s outside, big caveat, here,
outside of hospitals and care homes.

2205
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:25.927
So that means, basically,
that you are unlikely

2206
01:04:25.927 --> 01:04:30.927
to bump into somebody,
literally, who has coronavirus,

2207
01:04:33.219 --> 01:04:36.094
but of course, if you are coming
into work on a tube,

2208
01:04:36.094 --> 01:04:40.260
on a train, on a bus,
or walking along, you don’t know

2209
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.927
who that one in 400 people is.

2210
01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:47.135
So it is a reminder that social
distancing remains crucial.

2211
01:04:47.135 --> 01:04:50.552
I am trying to work out, Fergus,
if we should be surprised at that

2212
01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:53.344
number either being high or low.

2213
01:04:53.344 --> 01:04:56.469
Well, it was done at the end
of April, early May,

2214
01:04:56.469 --> 01:05:00.469
when the infection rate was already
falling quite a lot.

2215
01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:05.469
It would have been quite a lot
higher in early April.

2216
01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:10.969
But it would mean that if it stayed
at that rate, and clearly,

2217
01:05:10.969 --> 01:05:13.385
it goes up and down,
it would take something like,

2218
01:05:13.385 --> 01:05:15.885
I don’t know, six years
to get herd immunity.
