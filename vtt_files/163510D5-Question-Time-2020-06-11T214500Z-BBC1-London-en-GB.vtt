will you commit to educating the
British

124
00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.253
Will you commit to educating the
British public about the atrocities

125
00:04:17.253 --> 00:04:19.586
British public about the atrocities
of the British Empire, take down the

126
00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.378
of the British Empire, take down the
statues of slave traders in the UK

127
00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:23.711
stames of slave traders in the UK
and will you

128
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:24.544
statues of slave traders in the UK
and will you apologise for paying

129
00:04:24.544 --> 00:04:28.169
and will you apologise for paying
off of the owners of slaves and

130
00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:28.961
off of the owners of slaves and
accept -- a

131
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.711
off of the owners of slaves and
accept —— a doubt that the British

132
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:29.919
accept -- a doubt that the British
peopla

133
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.253
accept -- a doubt that the British
people were

134
00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:32.378
accept —— a doubt that the British
people were paying off as late as

135
00:04:32.378 --> 00:04:37.961
people were paying off as late as
2015. I think we have got to

136
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.169
2015. I think we have got to
confront our history warts and all

137
00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.586
confront our history warts and all
and while there are many things we

138
00:04:40.586 --> 00:04:41.253
and while there are many things we
ran be proud

139
00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:42.419
and while there are many things we
can be proud about with regards to

140
00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:42.586
ran be proud about with regards to
Britain

141
00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:44.378
can be proud about with regards to
Britain and its history, there is a

142
00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:46.294
Britain and its history, there is a
lot that we need to confront and be

143
00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:49.878
lot that we need to confront and be
honest about that is bad about our

144
00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:53.086
honest about that is bad about our
history. I

145
00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:53.294
honest about that is bad about our
history. Ithink

146
00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:53.878
honest about that is bad about our
history. I think that applying the

147
00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:56.128
history. I think that applying the
standards today to what may have

148
00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:57.961
standards today to what may have
happened many hundreds of years ago

149
00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:00.419
happened many hundreds of years ago
is a difficult concept to say the

150
00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.753
is a difficult concept to say the
least. And I think rather than using

151
00:05:02.753 --> 00:05:06.086
least. And I think rather than using
the language of blame and apology,

152
00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:06.753
the language of blame and apology,
we should be

153
00:05:06.753 --> 00:05:08.419
the language of blame and apology,
we should he being honest about it,

154
00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.419
we should be being honest about it,
being

155
00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.419
we should he being honest about it,
being forthright about it, using

156
00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.961
being forthright about it, using
democratic processes, wherever

157
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:16.211
democratic processes, wherever
possible, to deal with it. Let us

158
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.044
possible, to deal with it. Let us
take for example, particular statues

159
00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:18.169
take for example, particular status
to

160
00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:18.419
take for example, particular stames
to slave

161
00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.128
take for example, particular statues
to slave traders in Bristol or

162
00:05:20.128 --> 00:05:23.378
to slave traders in Bristol or
elsewhere, use the democratic

163
00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:24.753
elsewhere, use the democratic
process, through a proper decision

164
00:05:24.753 --> 00:05:27.211
process, through a proper decision
decide what to do with that

165
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:30.128
decide what to do with that
particular memorial or statue. Do

166
00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:31.794
particular memorial or statue. Do
you think they were wrong to tear it

167
00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:36.753
you think they were wrong to tear it
down? I think they were. Whilst I

168
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:37.003
down? I think they were. whilst I
absolutely

169
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:37.961
down? I think they were. Whilst I
absolutely get and understand the

170
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:39.753
absolutely get and understand the
huge strength of feeling that has

171
00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:42.003
huge strength of feeling that has
been engendered as a result of that

172
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:43.461
been engendered as a result of that
appalling incident in Minneapolis

173
00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:45.961
appalling incident in Minneapolis
and the fact that many people have

174
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:46.378
and the fact that many peopla have
just had

175
00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:47.794
and the fact that many people have
just had enough and I get that

176
00:05:47.794 --> 00:05:48.211
just had enough and I get that
utterty, I

177
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:48.419
just had enough and I get that
utterty, Ido

178
00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.253
just had enough and I get that
utterly, I do think that we all

179
00:05:49.253 --> 00:05:49.586
utterty, I do think that we all
await to

180
00:05:49.586 --> 00:05:51.586
utterly, I do think that we all
await to each other to respect the

181
00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:54.336
await to each other to respect the
mle of

182
00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:55.419
await to each other to respect the
rule of law and work for greater

183
00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.169
mle of law and work for greater
equality. I

184
00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.294
rule of law and work for greater
equality. I think the scenes that we

185
00:05:59.294 --> 00:06:00.753
equality. I think the scenes that we
saw in Bristol were disturbing in

186
00:06:00.753 --> 00:06:02.378
saw in Bristol were disturbing in
the sense that they did not seem to

187
00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:05.628
the sense that they did not seem to
be that sense of order. Your

188
00:06:05.628 --> 00:06:05.836
the sense that they did not seem to
be that sense of order. YourJustice

189
00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:06.336
be that sense of order. Your justice
Secretary, do

190
00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:07.253
be that sense of order. YourJustice
Secretary, do you want to see those

191
00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:07.461
Secretary, do you want to see those
peopla

192
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.086
Secretary, do you want to see those
people prosecuted? An investigation

193
00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:10.544
peopla prosecuted? An investigation
is ongoing,

194
00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:12.461
people prosecuted? An investigation
is ongoing, we have to let the

195
00:06:12.461 --> 00:06:12.961
is ongoing, we have to let the
police do their

196
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:14.169
is ongoing, we have to let the
police do theirjob independently

197
00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.378
police do theirjob independently
and let the prosecuting authorities

198
00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:16.378
and let the prosecuting authorities
follow the evidence wherever it

199
00:06:16.378 --> 00:06:20.753
follow the evidence wherever it
leads. The point I am making is if

200
00:06:20.753 --> 00:06:22.919
leads. The point I am making is if
we stand for something together,

201
00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.419
we stand for something together,
collectively, in this great country,

202
00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:25.378
collactively, in this great country,
it has got to

203
00:06:25.378 --> 00:06:27.211
collectively, in this great country,
it has got to be the rule of law and

204
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:27.461
it has got to be the ml; of law and
those

205
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:28.878
it has got to be the rule of law and
those values of freedom that

206
00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:31.169
those values of freedom that
attracted so many people here in the

207
00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.169
attracted so many people here in the
first place and make this country,

208
00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.169
first place and make this country,
whilst it is imperfect and there is

209
00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.461
whilst it is imperfect and there is
a huge amount for us to do, a good

210
00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:40.586
a huge amount for us to do, a good
place to live, because we have that

211
00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:42.919
place to live, because we have that
underpinning of the rule of law and

212
00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:43.211
underpinning of the mle of law and
democracy.

213
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.461
underpinning of the rule of law and
democracy. Let us celebrate that but

214
00:06:44.461 --> 00:06:47.211
democracy. Let us celebrate that but
also confront the past as well.

215
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:49.919
also confront the past as well.
Tessa, when you said you want the

216
00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:50.794
Tessa, when you said you want the
government to apologise for

217
00:06:50.794 --> 00:06:52.419
government to apologise for
reparations paid to countries until

218
00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.044
reparations paid to countries until
2015 for slavery, what are you

219
00:06:54.044 --> 00:06:59.253
2015 for slavery, what are you
referring to? The debt that we were

220
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:02.586
referring to? The debt that we were
paying off refers to the £20 million

221
00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.544
paying off refers to the £20 million
that was paid off to slave owners

222
00:07:04.544 --> 00:07:11.086
that was paid off to slave owners
when slavery became a legal in 1837

223
00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:13.419
when slavery became a legal in 1837
and that debt is something that the

224
00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:14.586
and that debt is something that the
British Government was paying off as

225
00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:20.461
British Government was paying off as
late as 2015. Robert? I think the

226
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:22.253
late as 2015. Robert? I think the
history of our islands is always

227
00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:23.961
history of our islands is always
with us. Where are we paying that

228
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:24.544
with us. where are we paying that
debt off

229
00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:27.628
with us. Where are we paying that
debt off until 2015? I think she is

230
00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:29.669
debt off until 2015? I think she is
right, I have read reports similarly

231
00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:29.753
right, I have read reports similarty
about

232
00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:30.794
right, I have read reports similarly
about that. She makes a very

233
00:07:30.794 --> 00:07:34.586
about that. She makes a very
powerful point about the fact that

234
00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:35.753
powerful point about the fact that
you cannot escape history and I

235
00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:37.128
you cannot escape history and I
think it would be fundamentally

236
00:07:37.128 --> 00:07:40.961
think it would be fundamentally
dishonest of us through removing

237
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:41.169
dishonest of us through removing
stames

238
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:41.961
dishonest of us through removing
statues and airbrushing out history

239
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.878
status and airbrushing out history
to then

240
00:07:43.878 --> 00:07:46.711
statues and airbrushing out history
to then pretend that all was well.

241
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:48.794
to then pretend that all was well.
Totalitarian regimes do that and

242
00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:50.211
Totalitarian regimes do that and
Communist regimes and other extreme

243
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:51.753
Communist regimes and other extreme
regimes do that sort of thing and

244
00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:53.961
regimes do that sort of thing and
then pretend that all is well. No,

245
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:56.169
then pretend that all is well. No,
we need to be honest, face up to it

246
00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:57.961
we need to be honest, face up to it
and accept the fact that we are as

247
00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:00.794
and accept the fact that we are as
much prisoners of our history as

248
00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:03.628
much prisoners of our history as
anything else, but we have a chance,

249
00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:04.461
anything else, but we have a chance,
through democracy, to break

250
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:04.628
anything else, but we have a chance,
through democracy, to breakfree

251
00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:04.878
anything else, but we have a chance,
through democracy, to break free and

252
00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:09.836
through democracy, to break free and
progress.

253
00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:14.794
progress. Bernardine. I

254
00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.294
progress. Bernardine. Idisagree, I
relish that statue being toppled in

255
00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:19.461
relish that statue being toppled in
Bristol. They had tried for decades

256
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:23.253
Bristol. They had tried for decades
to either get the statue removed or

257
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:28.044
to either get the statue removed or
get a park put on the statute to

258
00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:29.919
get a park put on the statute to
provide the context for Edward

259
00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:31.086
provide the context for Edward
Colson’s history as a slave trader

260
00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:34.044
Colson’s history as a slave trader
and I think everybody now knows that

261
00:08:34.044 --> 00:08:37.628
and I think everybody now knows that
he was culpable in terms of some

262
00:08:37.628 --> 00:08:39.544
he was culpable in terms of some
80,000 Africans been enslaved in the

263
00:08:39.544 --> 00:08:41.836
80,000 Africans been enslaved in the
New World and 20,000 of those

264
00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:46.211
New World and 20,000 of those
Africans were also lost at sea. He

265
00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:49.461
Africans were also lost at sea. He
was a really toxic symbol in Bristol

266
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.669
was a really toxic symbol in Bristol
and it was really important that he

267
00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:53.919
and it was really important that he
should go, or at least be

268
00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.461
should go, or at least be
contextualised and people tried to

269
00:08:55.461 --> 00:08:55.836
contextualised and peopla tried to
do that

270
00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:57.044
contextualised and people tried to
do that and I tried for decades and

271
00:08:57.044 --> 00:08:58.503
do that and I tried for decades and
they did not get anywhere with it.

272
00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:00.294
they did not get anywhere with it.
It felt to me that it was totally

273
00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:02.461
It felt to me that it was totally
right that they should topple that

274
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.461
right that they should topple that
statue, because of what he

275
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.253
statue, because of what he
represented and I am totally for a

276
00:09:06.253 --> 00:09:08.211
represented and I am totally for a
lot of the other statues in this

277
00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:11.003
lot of the other statues in this
country being removed and perhaps

278
00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:12.586
country being removed and perhaps
re—contextualised in museums or

279
00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:13.836
re—contextualised in museums or
somewhere where we actually

280
00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.086
somewhere where we actually
understand what role they played in

281
00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:18.336
understand what role they played in
society in a wider sense. The whole

282
00:09:18.336 --> 00:09:19.544
society in a wider sense. The whole
idea. what

283
00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:23.086
society in a wider sense. The whole
idea. What statues for example?

284
00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:23.253
idea. what stames for example?
There

285
00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:24.044
idea. What statues for example?
There was somebody removed from

286
00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:25.461
There was somebody removed from
outside the Museum of London for

287
00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:29.794
outside the Museum of London for
example. Robert Milligan. There is

288
00:09:29.794 --> 00:09:31.711
example. Robert Milligan. There is
also an argument about Lord Nelson,

289
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.128
also an argument about Lord Nelson,
who are such a totemic figure. Would

290
00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:36.253
who are such a totemic figure. Would
you want to see his statue come

291
00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:38.503
you want to see his statue come
down? I think we need to have that

292
00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:40.878
down? I think we need to have that
conversation, probably. There is

293
00:09:40.878 --> 00:09:42.794
conversation, probably. There is
also this argument that has come up

294
00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:45.044
also this argument that has come up
in terms of the statues, that we

295
00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:46.628
in terms of the statues, that we
cannot change history and that it is

296
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.003
cannot change history and that it is
the

297
00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:48.544
rannot change history and that it is
the history of

298
00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:49.461
cannot change history and that it is
the history of this country, but

299
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:51.836
the history of this country, but
actually history is a construction.

300
00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:54.794
actually history is a construction.
Events happen, we have a past, and

301
00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:58.336
Events happen, we have a past, and
then historians contextualised that

302
00:09:58.336 --> 00:09:59.503
then historians contextualised that
past and interrogated and what has

303
00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:02.169
past and interrogated and what has
happened in this country is

304
00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:06.544
happened in this country is
historically that has been done by a

305
00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:08.044
historically that has been done by a
late white men who have been the

306
00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:09.044
late white men who have been the
historians who have set the

307
00:10:09.044 --> 00:10:10.461
historians who have set the
framework for the events of the

308
00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:12.794
framework for the events of the
past. History is something that

309
00:10:12.794 --> 00:10:16.419
past. History is something that
needs to be challenged and

310
00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:17.044
needs to be challenged and
re—interrogated and revised

311
00:10:17.044 --> 00:10:22.086
re—interrogated and revised
constantly. Removing the statues is

312
00:10:22.086 --> 00:10:22.503
constantly. Removing the status is
in a

313
00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:23.711
constantly. Removing the statues is
in a sense, it is giving power to

314
00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:27.461
in a sense, it is giving power to
the people who really do object to a

315
00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:28.044
the peopla who really do object to a
symbol of

316
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:28.878
the people who really do object to a
symbol of their historical slavery

317
00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.253
symbol of their historical slavery
and all their allies as well. The

318
00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:36.253
and all their allies as well. The
other thing about history is that

319
00:10:36.253 --> 00:10:37.794
other thing about history is that
history has always excluded,

320
00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:39.503
history has always excluded,
primarily women, and people of

321
00:10:39.503 --> 00:10:39.669
primarily women, and peopla of
colour

322
00:10:39.669 --> 00:10:43.086
primarily women, and people of
colour and working class people and

323
00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:43.628
colour and working class peopla and
LGBT cue plus

324
00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:45.253
colour and working class people and
LGBT cue plus people in the ways it

325
00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:45.461
LGBT cue plus peopla in the ways it
has

326
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:47.086
LGBT cue plus people in the ways it
has been told and that also goes to

327
00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:49.086
has been told and that also goes to
what you were saying about the

328
00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:50.669
what you were saying about the
colonial history. A lot of people in

329
00:10:50.669 --> 00:10:51.669
colonial history. A lot of peopla in
this country do

330
00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:52.419
colonial history. A lot of people in
this country do not understand the

331
00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.503
this country do not understand the
colonial history or the understand

332
00:10:54.503 --> 00:10:55.919
colonial history or the understand
it through a certain prism, where

333
00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:57.169
it through a certain prism, where
they feel that Britain went and

334
00:10:57.169 --> 00:10:58.586
they feel that Britain went and
travelled all over the world in

335
00:10:58.586 --> 00:11:01.503
travelled all over the world in
order to help people. There is still

336
00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:03.044
order to help people. There is still
a section of society who do not

337
00:11:03.044 --> 00:11:05.086
a section of society who do not
think slavery was a really bad

338
00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:06.711
think slavery was a really bad
thing. I think it is really

339
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:06.919
thing. Ithink it is really
important

340
00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:07.628
thing. I think it is really
important that we interrogate

341
00:11:07.628 --> 00:11:09.044
important that we interrogate
history and when you have to take

342
00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:12.044
history and when you have to take
the law into your own hands and

343
00:11:12.044 --> 00:11:13.628
the law into your own hands and
remove the statue, nobody died, it

344
00:11:13.628 --> 00:11:15.544
remove the statue, nobody died, it
is just a little tin statue that was

345
00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:17.711
is just a little tin statue that was
thrown into a river, and that then

346
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.836
thrown into a river, and that then
led to this conversation we are

347
00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:20.169
lad to this conversation we are
having now,

348
00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:22.544
led to this conversation we are
having now, about the rest of the

349
00:11:22.544 --> 00:11:23.086
having now, about the rest of the
relic of

350
00:11:23.086 --> 00:11:24.211
having now, about the rest of the
relics of Britain’s murky past and I

351
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:24.753
relic of Britain’s murky past and I
think it is

352
00:11:24.753 --> 00:11:26.836
relics of Britain’s murky past and I
think it is really important. When

353
00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:27.003
think it is really important. when
Tessa

354
00:11:27.003 --> 00:11:28.586
think it is really important. When
Tessa talks about removing statues

355
00:11:28.586 --> 00:11:28.794
Tessa talks about removing status
of

356
00:11:28.794 --> 00:11:32.461
Tessa talks about removing statues
of anyone who has profited from

357
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.711
of anyone who has profited from
Empire, I

358
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:35.169
of anyone who has profited from
Empire, lam

359
00:11:35.169 --> 00:11:35.794
of anyone who has profited from
Empire, I am wondering, where does

360
00:11:35.794 --> 00:11:39.919
Empire, I am wondering, where does
that go? The visual symbols, the

361
00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:43.461
that go? The visual symbols, the
statues are really toxic and they

362
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:44.586
stames are really toxic and they
really are an

363
00:11:44.586 --> 00:11:45.836
statues are really toxic and they
really are an affront to our shared

364
00:11:45.836 --> 00:11:47.294
really are an affront to our shared
humanity and I think at least we

365
00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:50.378
humanity and I think at least we
need to look at that and, you know,

366
00:11:50.378 --> 00:11:52.503
need to look at that and, you know,
Britain was built on the wealth of

367
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.669
Britain was built on the wealth of
slavery and colonialism, that is the

368
00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:55.378
slavery and colonialism, that is the
truth. And we don’t really admit

369
00:11:55.378 --> 00:12:05.086
truth. And we don’t really admit
that. Rocco. There is a quote from

370
00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:07.044
that. Rocco. There is a quote from
Nelson Mandela that says hiding our

371
00:12:07.044 --> 00:12:09.253
Nelson Mandela that says hiding our
history is not the route to

372
00:12:09.253 --> 00:12:10.711
history is not the route to
enlightenment, we have to understand

373
00:12:10.711 --> 00:12:12.128
enlightenment, we have to understand
our history and we have to confront

374
00:12:12.128 --> 00:12:16.211
our history and we have to confront
it. And I agree very much with what

375
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:21.128
it. And I agree very much with what
Robert Buckland was saying, that we

376
00:12:21.128 --> 00:12:21.544
Robert Buckland was saying, that we
rannot

377
00:12:21.544 --> 00:12:21.711
Robert Buckland was saying, that we
cannot judge

378
00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:23.586
Robert Buckland was saying, that we
cannotjudge the past by the values

379
00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:24.128
cannot judge the past by the values
of today. It

380
00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:27.378
cannotjudge the past by the values
of today. It seems that people are

381
00:12:27.378 --> 00:12:28.544
of today. It seems that peopla are
trying to

382
00:12:28.544 --> 00:12:30.003
of today. It seems that people are
trying to use the evil of slavery to

383
00:12:30.003 --> 00:12:35.003
trying to use the evil of slavery to
rewrite the history of this country.

384
00:12:35.003 --> 00:12:38.044
rewrite the history of this country.
And try and negate the heritage that

385
00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:41.669
And try and negate the heritage that
this country has. Do you think it

386
00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:44.336
this country has. Do you think it
was wrong to take down the statue of

387
00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:45.711
was wrong to take down the statue of
Edward Colson? I think it was wrong

388
00:12:45.711 --> 00:12:48.044
Edward Colson? I think it was wrong
to take it down in that way and any

389
00:12:48.044 --> 00:12:49.836
to take it down in that way and any
vandalism of any kind is completely

390
00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:52.586
vandalism of any kind is completely
unacceptable. It is against the law

391
00:12:52.586 --> 00:12:56.586
unacceptable. It is against the law
and it is disgraceful that the

392
00:12:56.586 --> 00:12:57.961
and it is disgraceful that the
police, were not there in sufficient

393
00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:00.961
police, were not there in sufficient
numbers to prevent that happening.

394
00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:03.211
numbers to prevent that happening.
People have made comparison. The

395
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:10.253
People have made comparison. The
worst aspect for me of the London

396
00:13:10.253 --> 00:13:12.586
worst aspect for me of the London
demonstration, seeing police running

397
00:13:12.586 --> 00:13:12.961
demonstration, seeing police mnning
away from

398
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:13.753
demonstration, seeing police running
away from demonstrators, in fear,

399
00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:16.086
away from demonstrators, in fear,
that is a breakdown of law and order

400
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.794
that is a breakdown of law and order
and it is mob rule and it is

401
00:13:18.794 --> 00:13:19.086
and it is mob ml; and it is
completely

402
00:13:19.086 --> 00:13:20.294
and it is mob rule and it is
completely unacceptable. When you

403
00:13:20.294 --> 00:13:20.461
completely unacceptable. when you
talk

404
00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:22.669
completely unacceptable. When you
talk about vandalism, one example

405
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:24.669
talk about vandalism, one example
is, and I am not equating them, but

406
00:13:24.669 --> 00:13:26.044
is, and lam not equating them, but
the Bertin

407
00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:26.294
is, and I am not equating them, but
the Berlin Wall

408
00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:26.878
is, and I am not equating them, but
the Berlin Well for example, where

409
00:13:26.878 --> 00:13:27.669
the Bertin Wall for example, where
people just

410
00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:28.378
the Berlin Well for example, where
people just pulled it down

411
00:13:28.378 --> 00:13:29.711
people just pulled it down
themselves and the police to buy and

412
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.711
themselves and the police to buy and
let it happen. I’m not trying to say

413
00:13:33.711 --> 00:13:36.044
let it happen. I’m not trying to say
they are the same, but

414
00:13:36.044 --> 00:13:38.336
they are the same, but
nonetheless, . ..

415
00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:38.794
they are the same, but
nonetheless,... No, but

416
00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:39.003
they are the same, but
nonetheless, . .. No, but the

417
00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:39.253
they are the same, but
nonetheless,... No, but the argument

418
00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:41.003
nonetheless”. No, but the argument
that is made

419
00:13:41.003 --> 00:13:42.294
nonetheless,... No, but the argument
that is made is that it was

420
00:13:42.294 --> 00:13:43.586
that is made is that it was
something that people took upon

421
00:13:43.586 --> 00:13:46.878
something that people took upon
themselves to do. There have been

422
00:13:46.878 --> 00:13:47.003
themselves to do. There have been
stames

423
00:13:47.003 --> 00:13:47.253
themselves to do. There have been
statues of

424
00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:47.461
themselves to do. There have been
stames of long

425
00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:48.544
themselves to do. There have been
statues of long forgotten people at

426
00:13:48.544 --> 00:13:49.211
status of long forgotten peoplo at
a time

427
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:50.461
statues of long forgotten people at
a time when the country is

428
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:51.086
a time when the country is
Sleepwalking to economic

429
00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:51.586
a time when the country is
sleepwalking to economic disaster

430
00:13:51.586 --> 00:13:52.003
slaemlking to economic disaster
and our

431
00:13:52.003 --> 00:13:52.878
Sleepwalking to economic disaster
and our children are being prevented

432
00:13:52.878 --> 00:13:55.086
and our children are being prevented
from going to school. We will deal

433
00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:58.086
from going to school. We will deal
with one thing at a time. It is

434
00:13:58.086 --> 00:14:01.336
with one thing at a time. It is
mind—boggling. Let us talk to some

435
00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:01.669
mind-boggling. Let us talk to some
of our

436
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:06.378
mind—boggling. Let us talk to some
of our virtual audience. I think it

437
00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.753
of our virtual audience. I think it
is important that as a society we

438
00:14:07.753 --> 00:14:11.044
is important that as a society we
look at the past, we don’t need to

439
00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:13.878
look at the past, we don’t need to
glorify or celebrate the events of

440
00:14:13.878 --> 00:14:15.836
glorify or celebrate the events of
the past that we as a nation took

441
00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:19.586
the past that we as a nation took
part in. I agree that statues that

442
00:14:19.586 --> 00:14:25.378
part in. I agree that statues that
have links to the past, where there

443
00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:27.961
have links to the past, where there
are issues related to slavery, do

444
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:29.461
are issues related to slavery, do
need to be taken down. I’m not

445
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:31.086
need to be taken down. I’m not
asking for them to be had, I think

446
00:14:31.086 --> 00:14:32.753
asking for them to be had, I think
they need to be in a museum, because

447
00:14:32.753 --> 00:14:34.669
they need to be in a museum, because
they are great places to educate and

448
00:14:34.669 --> 00:14:41.003
they are great places to educate and
help remember the past. Maybe even

449
00:14:41.003 --> 00:14:46.169
help remember the past. Maybe even
have history

450
00:14:48.044 --> 00:14:50.253
have history about colonialism and
ethnic minority communities in the

451
00:14:50.253 --> 00:14:51.794
ethnic minority communities in the
curriculum and I think that would be

452
00:14:51.794 --> 00:14:53.169
curriculum and I think that would be
an important step for us as a

453
00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:58.753
an important step for us as a
society. I agree completely with

454
00:14:58.753 --> 00:15:02.044
society. I agree completely with
what was said about the fact, I went

455
00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:03.586
what was said about the fact, I went
to university in Bristol and four

456
00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:05.253
to university in Bristol and four
years it has been a topic of

457
00:15:05.253 --> 00:15:08.503
years it has been a topic of
discussion to take it down and the

458
00:15:08.503 --> 00:15:09.878
discussion to take it down and the
voices are democratic, people have

459
00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:11.461
voices are democratic, people have
been asking to take it down and they

460
00:15:11.461 --> 00:15:18.003
been asking to take it down and they
have been ignored. Who are they

461
00:15:18.003 --> 00:15:18.503
have been ignored. who are they
trying to

462
00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:19.211
have been ignored. Who are they
trying to protect? They were trying

463
00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:24.044
trying to protect? They were trying
to protect the name and you say it

464
00:15:24.044 --> 00:15:25.461
to protect the name and you say it
was disturbing that it was taken

465
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:26.753
was disturbing that it was taken
down, if you think about the people

466
00:15:26.753 --> 00:15:29.586
down, if you think about the peopla
it has

467
00:15:29.586 --> 00:15:31.086
down, if you think about the people
it has affected and the ancestors of

468
00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:33.003
it has affected and the ancestors of
people passing it every day, to see

469
00:15:33.003 --> 00:15:34.044
people passing it every day, to see
someone glorify when they have

470
00:15:34.044 --> 00:15:36.836
someone glorify when they have
killed thousands of people and are

471
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:37.211
killed thousands of peopla and are
being

472
00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:38.919
killed thousands of people and are
being celebrated in a way so

473
00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:39.378
being celabrated in a way so
publicly. I

474
00:15:39.378 --> 00:15:42.461
being celebrated in a way so
publicly. I don’t agree with what

475
00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:43.336
publicly. I don’t agree with what
Rocco or the Justice

476
00:15:43.336 --> 00:15:43.461
publicly. I don’t agree with what
Rocco or theJustice Secretary

477
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:43.669
publicly. I don’t agree with what
Rocco or the Justice Secretary said

478
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:47.419
Rocco or the justice Secretary said
there.

479
00:15:47.419 --> 00:15:50.086
Rocco or the Justice Secretary said
there. There are still people just

480
00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:50.586
there. There are still people just
that may are

481
00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:51.378
there. There are still people just
that mag are trying to justify what

482
00:15:51.378 --> 00:15:51.628
that may are trying to justify what
that

483
00:15:51.628 --> 00:15:56.711
that mag are trying to justify what
that man did. Elaine. I like the

484
00:15:56.711 --> 00:16:01.669
that man did. Elaine. I like the
second part of the question because

485
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.003
second part of the question because
there will be equal measures on both

486
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.544
there will be equal measures on both
sides and I am really interested in

487
00:16:04.544 --> 00:16:07.294
sides and I am really interested in
how we will all come together and

488
00:16:07.294 --> 00:16:08.253
how we will all come together and
have a critical conversation about

489
00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:08.878
have a critical conversation about
how we can

490
00:16:08.878 --> 00:16:10.378
have a critical conversation about
how we ran go

491
00:16:10.378 --> 00:16:11.253
have a critical conversation about
how we can go forward with this

492
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:12.544
how we ran go forward with this
issue.

493
00:16:12.544 --> 00:16:15.753
how we can go forward with this
issue. Let me come to

494
00:16:15.753 --> 00:16:16.336
how we can go forward with this
issue. Let me come toJohn Williams

495
00:16:16.336 --> 00:16:19.253
issue. Let me come to john Williams
on that. john, you

496
00:16:19.253 --> 00:16:19.961
issue. Let me come toJohn Williams
on that. John, you wanted to take

497
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:20.253
on that. john, you wanted to take
this question

498
00:16:20.253 --> 00:16:24.211
on that. John, you wanted to take
this question forward.

499
00:16:24.211 --> 00:16:27.544
Will the possible taking down of 60
statues in the UK advance the cause

500
00:16:27.544 --> 00:16:28.378
of Black Lives Matter?

501
00:16:34.669 --> 00:16:39.711
Vaughan, this leads on from Tessa’s
question, whether or not taking the

502
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:40.669
question, whether or not taking the
status

503
00:16:40.669 --> 00:16:41.711
question, whether or not taking the
statues down is productive, whether

504
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:42.336
stames down is productive, whether
you approved

505
00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.794
statues down is productive, whether
you approved of what happened in

506
00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.128
you approved of what happened in
Bristol. Is it perhaps obscuring a

507
00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:47.086
Bristol. Is it perhaps obscuring a
larger or helping a larger

508
00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:49.586
larger or helping a larger
discussion? I am

509
00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:49.794
larger or helping a larger
discussion? lam pleased

510
00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:49.961
larger or helping a larger
discussion? I am pleased that

511
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:50.169
larger or helping a larger
discussion? I am pleased thatJohn

512
00:16:50.169 --> 00:16:50.419
discussion? lam pleased that john
has

513
00:16:50.419 --> 00:16:55.003
discussion? I am pleased thatJohn
has made his point. I do think some

514
00:16:55.003 --> 00:16:57.211
has made his point. I do think some
of the statues need to come down and

515
00:16:57.211 --> 00:16:57.711
of the stames need to come down and
others

516
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:01.586
of the statues need to come down and
others that stay up need greater

517
00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:03.503
others that stay up need greater
context, about who those figures

518
00:17:03.503 --> 00:17:06.961
context, about who those figures
were. But the Black Lives Matter is

519
00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:08.044
were. But the Black Lives Mather is
not a campaign

520
00:17:08.044 --> 00:17:09.003
were. But the Black Lives Matter is
not a campaign to re—engineer our

521
00:17:09.003 --> 00:17:09.253
not a campaign to re-engineer our
pub“:

522
00:17:09.253 --> 00:17:09.419
not a campaign to re-engineer our
public space

523
00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:12.211
not a campaign to re—engineer our
public space and remove statues. It

524
00:17:12.211 --> 00:17:14.419
public space and remove statues. It
is not even about the death of

525
00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:16.628
is not even about the death of
George Floyd, it is about the

526
00:17:16.628 --> 00:17:19.961
George Floyd, it is about the
persistent and continuing racial

527
00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:21.794
persistent and continuing racial
inequality and in America and other

528
00:17:21.794 --> 00:17:23.169
inequality and in America and other
countries around the world and in

529
00:17:23.169 --> 00:17:26.211
countries around the world and in
our own. That is the point. Within

530
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.253
our own. That is the point. within
that, this is only

531
00:17:27.253 --> 00:17:28.044
our own. That is the point. Within
that, this is only one small part

532
00:17:28.044 --> 00:17:30.794
that, this is only one small part
about the debate we have to have,

533
00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:33.169
about the debate we have to have,
and also about the action we need to

534
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:34.919
and also about the action we need to
take. All of us are painfully

535
00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:36.294
take. All of us are painfully
familiar with the fact that the

536
00:17:36.294 --> 00:17:36.836
familiar with the fact that the
criminal

537
00:17:36.836 --> 00:17:40.794
familiar with the fact that the
criminaljustice act is different,

538
00:17:40.794 --> 00:17:41.586
criminal justice act is different,
if you look at

539
00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:42.419
criminaljustice act is different,
if you look at people like me or

540
00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:43.794
if you look at peopla like me or
Robert, and

541
00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:46.586
if you look at people like me or
Robert, and they are different and

542
00:17:46.586 --> 00:17:49.419
Robert, and they are different and
that is the action that we need to

543
00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:51.753
that is the action that we need to
be taken, and not get led down a

544
00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:53.419
be taken, and not get lad down a
blind alley. It

545
00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:54.586
be taken, and not get led down a
blind alley. It is not examining our

546
00:17:54.586 --> 00:17:57.211
blind alley. It is not examining our
distant past and rewriting our

547
00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:58.586
distant past and rewriting our
history, it is understanding our

548
00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:00.211
history, it is understanding our
past to help build our

549
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:00.794
history, it is understanding our
past to help build ourfuture. The

550
00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:01.294
past to help build our future. The
“Y

551
00:18:01.294 --> 00:18:02.919
past to help build ourfuture. The
way politicians talk about this

552
00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:04.586
way politicians talk about this
matter is. I think the Prime

553
00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:06.003
matter is. I think the Prime
Minister would be in a better

554
00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:07.044
Minister would be in a better
position to do his job

555
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.253
Minister would be in a better
position to do hisjob if he

556
00:18:09.253 --> 00:18:11.961
position to do hisjob if he
recognised at the start of the

557
00:18:11.961 --> 00:18:12.544
recognised at the start of the
21st—century talking about

558
00:18:12.544 --> 00:18:12.753
21st—century talking about
watermelon

559
00:18:12.753 --> 00:18:12.961
2lst—century talking about
watermelon smiles

560
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:17.419
21st—century talking about
watermelon smiles was not helpful.

561
00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:17.961
watermelon smiles was not helpful.
We ran

562
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:19.128
watermelon smiles was not helpful.
We can all learn from this and take

563
00:18:19.128 --> 00:18:20.169
We ran all learn from this and take
the

564
00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:21.711
We can all learn from this and take
the opportunity of this

565
00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:25.336
the opportunity of this
extraordinary movement to accept the

566
00:18:25.336 --> 00:18:28.461
extraordinary movement to accept the
view of our past, but it is much

567
00:18:28.461 --> 00:18:31.378
view of our past, but it is much
more important to make changes to

568
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.461
more important to make changes to
our shared future. Liz, you will

569
00:18:33.461 --> 00:18:35.169
our shared future. Liz, you will
want to respond. Looking at

570
00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:36.003
our shared future. Liz, you will
want to respond. Looking atJohn and

571
00:18:36.003 --> 00:18:36.503
want to respond. Looking at john and
Tessa’s

572
00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:38.878
want to respond. Looking atJohn and
Tessa’s question, it is two size of

573
00:18:38.878 --> 00:18:41.128
Tessa’s question, it is two size of
the same coin. Should we be taking

574
00:18:41.128 --> 00:18:42.419
the same coin. Should we be taking
stames

575
00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:44.128
the same coin. Should we be taking
statues down and removing portraits

576
00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:44.961
statues down and removing portraits
commemorating people who profited

577
00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:45.211
commemorating peopla who profited
from

578
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:48.169
commemorating people who profited
from slavery or the Empire? Or is

579
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.586
from slavery or the Empire? Or is
that counter—productive in terms of

580
00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:51.211
that counter-productive in terms of
looking at the

581
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:53.503
that counter—productive in terms of
looking at the bigger issue?

582
00:18:53.503 --> 00:18:56.086
looking at the bigger issue?
Certainly this is a time where I

583
00:18:56.086 --> 00:18:59.419
Certainly this is a time where I
look back to the time when I was

584
00:18:59.419 --> 00:19:01.586
look back to the time when I was
raised in Eltham and the appalling

585
00:19:01.586 --> 00:19:06.211
raised in Eltham and the appalling
murder of Stephen Lawrence. At that

586
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.336
murder of Stephen Lawrence. At that
time it drove many establishment

587
00:19:09.336 --> 00:19:11.336
time it drove many establishment
changes, but it did not drive

588
00:19:11.336 --> 00:19:13.336
changes, but it did not drive
enough, we know that. We know that

589
00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:15.919
enough, we know that. We know that
we live in a racist society. There

590
00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:18.669
we live in a racist society. There
is one thing I could refer back to,

591
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:21.586
is one thing I could refer back to,
about what Vaughan said. This is

592
00:19:21.586 --> 00:19:22.169
about what Vaughan said. This is
disappointing. Frankly, I

593
00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:22.336
about what Vaughan said. This is
disappointing. Frankly, Ithink

594
00:19:22.336 --> 00:19:22.586
about what Vaughan said. This is
disappointing. Frankly, I think we

595
00:19:22.586 --> 00:19:24.169
disappointing. Frankly, Ithinkwe
are trying to

596
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.961
disappointing. Frankly, I think we
are trying to fight from the same

597
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:27.378
are trying to fight from the same
corner. You do know that Plaid Cymru

598
00:19:27.378 --> 00:19:27.878
corner. You do know that Plaid Cymm
and Adam

599
00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:28.794
corner. You do know that Plaid Cymru
and Adam Price has called for an

600
00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:30.711
and Adam Price has rallad for an
enquiry into

601
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.586
and Adam Price has called for an
enquiry into structural racism in

602
00:19:31.586 --> 00:19:31.961
enquiry into stmctural racism in
Walas in

603
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:33.919
enquiry into structural racism in
Wales in response to his questioning

604
00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:37.544
Wales in response to his questioning
that the First Minister of Wales

605
00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:40.461
that the First Minister of Wales
responded to, supported the concept

606
00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:42.378
responded to, supported the concept
of a black and minority ethnic

607
00:19:42.378 --> 00:19:44.128
of a black and minority ethnic
museum in Wales and it has been

608
00:19:44.128 --> 00:19:44.586
museum in Wales and it has been
Plaid Cymm

609
00:19:44.586 --> 00:19:45.669
museum in Wales and it has been
Plaid Cymru who has been leading on

610
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:46.378
Plaid Cymm who has been leading on
the major point,

611
00:19:46.378 --> 00:19:47.128
Plaid Cymru who has been leading on
the major point, which is changes to

612
00:19:47.128 --> 00:19:56.919
the major point, which is changes to
the curriculum. Vaughan is referring

613
00:19:56.919 --> 00:19:58.253
the curriculum. Vaughan is referring
to oils compared to a colonial

614
00:19:58.253 --> 00:20:02.128
to oils compared to a colonial
outpost. One of the petty things we

615
00:20:02.128 --> 00:20:02.753
outpost. One of the petty things we
do in politis

616
00:20:02.753 --> 00:20:03.628
outpost. One of the petty things we
do in politics in the United Kingdom

617
00:20:03.628 --> 00:20:05.211
do in politic in the United Kingdom
is bring it down

618
00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:06.169
do in politics in the United Kingdom
is bring it down to personalities.

619
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:09.169
is bring it down to personalities.
These are big, serious questions.

620
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:11.753
These are big, serious questions.
Looking at the statues, and I raised

621
00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:12.003
Looking at the statics, and I raised
this

622
00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.003
Looking at the statues, and I raised
this yesterday with the Prime

623
00:20:14.003 --> 00:20:15.211
this yesterday with the Prime
Minister, what we have within the

624
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:17.003
Minister, what we have within the
United Kingdom is a way of

625
00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:19.211
United Kingdom is a way of
presenting history very much through

626
00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:21.003
presenting history very much through
the eyes of the Conservatives. The

627
00:20:21.003 --> 00:20:23.169
the eyes of the Conservatives. The
Prime Minister, when I asked him on

628
00:20:23.169 --> 00:20:24.586
Prime Minister, when I asked him on
this question, is that conservatives

629
00:20:24.586 --> 00:20:27.128
this question, is that conservatives
do not pull down statues. It was the

630
00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:30.544
do not pull down statues. It was the
imagery of the past and yet, and I

631
00:20:30.544 --> 00:20:33.253
imagery of the past and yet, and I
know the Lord Chancellor will agree

632
00:20:33.253 --> 00:20:35.211
know the Lord Chancellor will agree
with this, we have much better

633
00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:36.544
with this, we have much better
legislation in place to deal with

634
00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:36.711
lagislation in place to deal with
racial

635
00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:40.003
legislation in place to deal with
racial hatred, but we still live

636
00:20:40.003 --> 00:20:41.919
racial hatred, but we still live
within a racist society which acts

637
00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:45.086
within a racist society which acts
on racism. The question I have is,

638
00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:48.836
on racism. The question I have is,
how are we going to bring about the

639
00:20:48.836 --> 00:20:51.253
how are we going to bring about the
big, social changes? The big changes

640
00:20:51.253 --> 00:20:53.169
big, social changes? The big changes
in attitudes? That is why the

641
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.711
in attitudes? That is why the
statues are so interesting because

642
00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:57.169
statues are so interesting because
they are so symbolic of a certain

643
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:58.586
they are so symbolic of a certain
sort of history that said the Empire

644
00:20:58.586 --> 00:21:01.128
sort of history that said the Empire
was fine, the British Empire was a

645
00:21:01.128 --> 00:21:05.544
was fine, the British Empire was a
force for good in the world. This is

646
00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:06.003
force for good in the world. This is
not two.

647
00:21:06.003 --> 00:21:07.711
force for good in the world. This is
not true. Now is the time to come to

648
00:21:07.711 --> 00:21:09.169
not tme. Now is the time to come to
recognise it is not

649
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.919
not true. Now is the time to come to
recognise it is notjust the history

650
00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:11.169
recognise it is not just the history
of powerful,

651
00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:12.044
recognise it is notjust the history
of powerful, white men who often

652
00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:13.461
of powerful, white men who often
made their money and their fortunes

653
00:21:13.461 --> 00:21:15.669
made their money and their fortunes
out of the sufferings of others. Now

654
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:17.544
out of the sufferings of others. Now
is the time for the voice of the

655
00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:19.044
is the time for the voice of the
others to come through and that is

656
00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:22.711
others to come through and that is
my hope for the future. We are

657
00:21:22.711 --> 00:21:24.294
my hope for the future. We are
having this discussion here, but it

658
00:21:24.294 --> 00:21:26.794
having this discussion here, but it
has to go beyond the usual talking

659
00:21:26.794 --> 00:21:28.169
has to go beyond the usual talking
heads or politicians and get into

660
00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:29.753
heads or politicians and get into
our curriculum and really change

661
00:21:29.753 --> 00:21:38.336
our curriculum and really change
people’s attitudes. Slavery has bred

662
00:21:38.336 --> 00:21:41.169
people’s attitudes. Slavery has bred
racism. As a person in a responsible

663
00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:42.419
racism. As a person in a responsible
position I cannot even bring myself

664
00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:42.669
position I cannot even bring myself
to

665
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:43.586
position I rannot even bring myself
to repeat

666
00:21:43.586 --> 00:21:45.211
position I cannot even bring myself
to repeat what some politicians,

667
00:21:45.211 --> 00:21:46.169
to repeat what some politicians,
including our Prime minister, has

668
00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:47.961
including our Prime minister, has
said in the past about ethnic

669
00:21:47.961 --> 00:21:51.294
said in the past about ethnic
minorities. I have been reading

670
00:21:51.294 --> 00:21:52.336
minorities. I have been reading
history at AS—level and revising

671
00:21:52.336 --> 00:21:56.294
history at AS-level and revising
with my son.

672
00:21:56.294 --> 00:21:57.128
history at AS—level and revising
with my son. The curriculum needs to

673
00:21:57.128 --> 00:22:03.253
with my son. The curriculum needs to
change. The War of independence is

674
00:22:03.253 --> 00:22:04.586
change. The War of independence is
depicted as the Indian mutiny. That

675
00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:09.003
depicted as the Indian mutiny. That
needs to change. Especially for

676
00:22:09.003 --> 00:22:10.878
needs to change. Especially for
children who are born and bred over

677
00:22:10.878 --> 00:22:12.794
children who are born and bred over
here. My son considers himself as

678
00:22:12.794 --> 00:22:17.961
here. My son considers himself as
Welsh. And for him to read history

679
00:22:17.961 --> 00:22:19.961
Welsh. And for him to read history
in a different manner than what I

680
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:23.378
in a different manner than what I
have read, and what I have read

681
00:22:23.378 --> 00:22:27.253
have read, and what I have read
recently, I think it is important

682
00:22:27.253 --> 00:22:29.461
recently, I think it is important
that violence should be condemned,

683
00:22:29.461 --> 00:22:29.628
that violance should be condemned,
but

684
00:22:29.628 --> 00:22:31.086
that violence should be condemned,
but racism from top down needs to be

685
00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:33.753
but racism from top down needs to be
dealt with. I am very proud to live

686
00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:37.461
dealt with. I am very proud to live
in Cardiff and to have worked in

687
00:22:37.461 --> 00:22:41.211
in Cardiff and to have worked in
Cardiff for the last 25 years. It is

688
00:22:41.211 --> 00:22:42.336
Cardiff for the last 25 years. It is
a multicultural society, but we need

689
00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:45.378
a multicultural society, but we need
to make sure from the top down, from

690
00:22:45.378 --> 00:22:46.086
to make sure from the top down, from
Doris

691
00:22:46.086 --> 00:22:47.961
to make sure from the top down, from
Boris downwards, we need to deal

692
00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:53.711
Boris downwards, we need to deal
with this racism. Robert, you heard

693
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:58.086
with this racism. Robert, you heard
the Prime Minister talk about this

694
00:22:58.086 --> 00:22:59.378
the Prime Minister talk about this
yesterday, at Prime Minister’s

695
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:02.003
yesterday, at Prime Minister’s
Questions, the comment he made about

696
00:23:02.003 --> 00:23:04.878
Questions, the comment he made about
taken in wave it at the Queen and

697
00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:07.419
taken in wave it at the Queen and
watermelon smiles, has come back to

698
00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:09.044
watermelon smiles, has come back to
haunt him. What will we see from the

699
00:23:09.044 --> 00:23:09.544
haunt him. what will we see from the
government if

700
00:23:09.544 --> 00:23:12.794
haunt him. What will we see from the
government if anything? The Prime

701
00:23:12.794 --> 00:23:13.961
government if anything? The Prime
Minister who was mayor or probably

702
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:17.253
Minister who was mayor or probably
the most cosmopolitan city in the

703
00:23:17.253 --> 00:23:19.336
the most cosmopolitan city in the
world and who was elected twice and

704
00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:19.711
world and who was eluted twice and
whose

705
00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:21.753
world and who was elected twice and
whose approach to issues of

706
00:23:21.753 --> 00:23:23.461
whose approach to issues of
migration and multiculturalism has

707
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:26.294
migration and multiculturalism has
been open, liberal and inclusive.

708
00:23:26.294 --> 00:23:30.003
been open, liberal and inclusive.
And his remarks in the aftermath of

709
00:23:30.003 --> 00:23:31.128
And his remarks in the aftermath of
the unlawful killing of George Floyd

710
00:23:31.128 --> 00:23:34.378
the unlawful killing of George Floyd
I think were appropriate. They

711
00:23:34.378 --> 00:23:34.586
I think were appropriate. They
stmck

712
00:23:34.586 --> 00:23:37.086
I think were appropriate. They
struck the right tone and he talked

713
00:23:37.086 --> 00:23:38.711
stmck the right tone and he talked
in a positive

714
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:39.544
struck the right tone and he talked
in a positive way about what needed

715
00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:43.086
in a positive way about what needed
to be done. I think absolutely we

716
00:23:43.086 --> 00:23:45.586
to be done. I think absolutely we
have the right approach. I think

717
00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:48.503
have the right approach. I think
that sense of trying to bring people

718
00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:51.378
that sense of trying to bring people
together is what we need now. I

719
00:23:51.378 --> 00:23:55.378
together is what we need now. I
think a lot of the remarks are on

720
00:23:55.378 --> 00:23:57.753
think a lot of the remarks are on
the money when it comes to the fact

721
00:23:57.753 --> 00:24:00.003
the money when it comes to the fact
that rather than focusing upon icons

722
00:24:00.003 --> 00:24:03.419
that rather than focusing upon icons
and statues, actions speak far

723
00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:05.961
and statues, actions speak far
louder than words. Vaughan has made

724
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:07.919
louder than words. Vaughan has made
the point about the criminal justice

725
00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:09.419
the point about the criminal justice
system and I have responsibility for

726
00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:12.211
system and I have responsibility for
that in England and Wales and I take

727
00:24:12.211 --> 00:24:12.294
that in England and Walas and I take
responsibility

728
00:24:12.294 --> 00:24:15.294
that in England and Wales and I take
responsibility for the need to

729
00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:17.669
responsibility for the need to
improve the way in which we deal

730
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:19.294
improve the way in which we deal
with black and minority ethnic

731
00:24:19.294 --> 00:24:19.711
with black and minority ethnic
peopla in

732
00:24:19.711 --> 00:24:20.669
with black and minority ethnic
people in that system. There are a

733
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:22.794
people in that system. There are a
whole range of things that we are

734
00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:23.128
whola range of things that we are
doing. No

735
00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:25.086
whole range of things that we are
doing. No time to go into them now,

736
00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:26.336
doing. No time to go into them now,
but the practical measures we have

737
00:24:26.336 --> 00:24:29.003
but the practical measures we have
got to do to make their experience

738
00:24:29.003 --> 00:24:33.503
got to do to make their experience
different. The black population in

739
00:24:33.503 --> 00:24:33.711
different. The black population in
Walas

740
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:35.044
different. The black population in
Wales is overrepresented by five

741
00:24:35.044 --> 00:24:37.711
Wales is overrepresented by five
times within the prison population

742
00:24:37.711 --> 00:24:40.294
times within the prison population
of Wales. Surely that is a desperate

743
00:24:40.294 --> 00:24:42.544
of Wales. Surely that is a desperate
failure? That is an indication of

744
00:24:42.544 --> 00:24:47.128
failure? That is an indication of
the racism in our side society in

745
00:24:47.128 --> 00:24:48.503
the racism in our side society in
action. Would you commit to using

746
00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:51.919
action. Would you commit to using
that as a target, to reduce that an

747
00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:55.336
that as a target, to reduce that an
acceptable percentage within the

748
00:24:55.336 --> 00:24:56.128
acceptable percentage within the
prison population? Specifically in

749
00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:58.294
prison population? Specifically in
Wales? Of course it applies

750
00:24:58.294 --> 00:25:00.503
Wales? Of course it applies
throughout England and Wales. I

751
00:25:00.503 --> 00:25:00.711
throughout England and Walas. I
would

752
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:02.336
throughout England and Wales. I
would commit to making sure that the

753
00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:02.669
would commit to making sure that the
problams that

754
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:04.461
would commit to making sure that the
problems that are inherited by the

755
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:04.586
problems that are inherited by the
criminal

756
00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:05.169
problems that are inherited by the
criminaljustice

757
00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:05.378
problems that are inherited by the
criminal justice system

758
00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:05.669
problems that are inherited by the
criminaljustice system are dealt

759
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.919
criminal justice system are dealt
with

760
00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:07.586
criminaljustice system are dealt
with further up the line and the

761
00:25:07.586 --> 00:25:11.378
with further up the line and the
diversions that I needed in order to

762
00:25:11.378 --> 00:25:13.253
diversions that I needed in order to
help people of that background not

763
00:25:13.253 --> 00:25:13.836
help peopla of that background not
to get into

764
00:25:13.836 --> 00:25:14.919
help people of that background not
to get into the system in the first

765
00:25:14.919 --> 00:25:16.586
to get into the system in the first
place I what we are going to have to

766
00:25:16.586 --> 00:25:17.669
place I what we are going to have to
do. That is not

767
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:20.586
place I what we are going to have to
do. That is notjust me, that is

768
00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:20.836
do. That is not just me, that is
education,

769
00:25:20.836 --> 00:25:21.586
do. That is notjust me, that is
education, health, housing, the

770
00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:24.211
education, health, housing, the
whole apparatus of government in

771
00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:24.544
whola apparatus of government in
Walas

772
00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:25.169
whole apparatus of government in
Wales and Westminster coming

773
00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:29.669
Wales and Westminster coming
together around the problem of the

774
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:30.128
together around the problem of the
individual, rather

775
00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:30.336
together around the problem of the
individual, ratherthan

776
00:25:30.336 --> 00:25:30.711
together around the problem of the
individual, rather than this silo

777
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:34.336
individual, rather than this silo
approach where I end up responsible

778
00:25:34.336 --> 00:25:35.128
approach where I end up responsible
for assisting with a

779
00:25:35.128 --> 00:25:35.961
for assisting with a
disproportionate number of young

780
00:25:35.961 --> 00:25:36.378
disproportionate number of young
peopla from

781
00:25:36.378 --> 00:25:40.711
disproportionate number of young
people from that background. This is

782
00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:41.128
peopla from that background. This is
a mass

783
00:25:41.128 --> 00:25:42.461
people from that background. This is
a mass refusal to engage in the

784
00:25:42.461 --> 00:25:45.919
a mass refusal to engage in the
reality that the Prime Minister has

785
00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:49.128
reality that the Prime Minister has
been deeply offensive at the start

786
00:25:49.128 --> 00:25:50.669
been deeply offensive at the start
of the 21st century, it is a real

787
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:55.044
of the 21st century, it is a real
issue. For people like me it

788
00:25:55.044 --> 00:25:55.878
issue. For peopla like me it
matters, just

789
00:25:55.878 --> 00:25:56.669
issue. For people like me it
matters, just as someone comparing

790
00:25:56.669 --> 00:26:01.211
matters, just as someone comparing
the experience of Wales to colour

791
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:02.336
the experience of Wales to colour
people in the American experience.

792
00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:04.419
people in the American experience.
It matters and it is offensive. If

793
00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:05.211
It matters and it is offensive. If
we want to

794
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:05.336
It matters and it is offensive. If
we we nt to move

795
00:26:05.336 --> 00:26:06.461
It matters and it is offensive. If
we want to move on, we have got to

796
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:08.628
we wantto move on, we have goth
accept it is not

797
00:26:08.628 --> 00:26:10.878
we want to move on, we have got to
accept it is not acceptable and you

798
00:26:10.878 --> 00:26:12.169
accept it is not acceptable and you
get credit for yourself and the

799
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:16.044
get credit for yourself and the
party- If you

800
00:26:16.044 --> 00:26:16.753
get credit for yourself and the
party. If you could only acknowledge

801
00:26:16.753 --> 00:26:20.003
party. If you could only acknowledge
what is staring you in the face. It

802
00:26:20.003 --> 00:26:22.253
what is staring you in the face. It
does not matter that I am a

803
00:26:22.253 --> 00:26:23.753
does not matter that I am a
politician, I am this colour every

804
00:26:23.753 --> 00:26:24.419
politician, I am this colour every
singla day of

805
00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:25.128
politician, I am this colour every
single day of the year and it

806
00:26:25.128 --> 00:26:28.669
single day of the year and it
matters to me that we are spoken

807
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:30.711
matters to me that we are spoken
about in a way that reflects who we

808
00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:31.128
about in a way that reﬂacts who we
are and

809
00:26:31.128 --> 00:26:32.836
about in a way that reflects who we
are and not the colour of our skin

810
00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:34.919
are and not the colour of our skin
and make sure you are not making

811
00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:35.794
and make sure you are not making
these mealy—mouthed apologies for

812
00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:35.919
these meaty-mouthed apologies for
things

813
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:36.169
these mealy-mouthed apologies for
things that

814
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:41.211
these mealy—mouthed apologies for
things that are clearly wrong. I

815
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:41.503
things that are dearty wrong. I
found

816
00:26:41.503 --> 00:26:43.461
things that are clearly wrong. I
found Boris offensive all along with

817
00:26:43.461 --> 00:26:44.544
found Boris offensive all along with
his journalism

818
00:26:44.544 --> 00:26:44.669
found Boris offensive all along with
hisjournalism in

819
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:45.128
found Boris offensive all along with
his journalism in the Spectator,

820
00:26:45.128 --> 00:26:48.128
his journalism in the Spectator,
with the racist things he said. When

821
00:26:48.128 --> 00:26:48.336
with the racist things he said. when
he

822
00:26:48.336 --> 00:26:52.003
with the racist things he said. When
he became Mayor of London he became

823
00:26:52.003 --> 00:26:53.044
he became Mayor of London he became
mayor of an incredibly multicultural

824
00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.628
mayor of an incredibly multicultural
city, but one of the first things to

825
00:26:54.628 --> 00:26:58.503
city, but one of the first things to
try to do was get rid of Black

826
00:26:58.503 --> 00:27:00.461
try to do was get rid of Black
History Month. We are talking about

827
00:27:00.461 --> 00:27:02.628
History Month. We are talking about
the importance of history and

828
00:27:02.628 --> 00:27:03.836
the importance of history and
acknowledging the past and also we

829
00:27:03.836 --> 00:27:04.086
acknowladging the past and also we
should

830
00:27:04.086 --> 00:27:07.378
acknowledging the past and also we
should be celebrating the entire

831
00:27:07.378 --> 00:27:09.503
should be celebrating the entire
population, people of colour and our

832
00:27:09.503 --> 00:27:10.544
population, people of colour and our
contribution to this society, we

833
00:27:10.544 --> 00:27:12.503
contribution to this society, we
have been here since the Romans, it

834
00:27:12.503 --> 00:27:15.128
have been here since the Romans, it
is something I have written about.

835
00:27:15.128 --> 00:27:16.919
is something I have written about.
We have a mayor who tries to get rid

836
00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:18.586
We have a mayor who tries to get rid
of the single thing that we do to

837
00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:18.919
of the singla thing that we do to
bring to

838
00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:20.711
of the single thing that we do to
bring to the wider public the fact

839
00:27:20.711 --> 00:27:23.753
bring to the wider public the fact
that we have a history. The truth is

840
00:27:23.753 --> 00:27:26.086
that we have a history. The truth is
black history is a British history,

841
00:27:26.086 --> 00:27:28.419
black history is a British history,
this is a multicultural country and

842
00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:30.086
this is a multicultural country and
it always has been. British history

843
00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:32.003
it always has been. British history
is world history because we had an

844
00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:33.919
is world history because we had an
empire that ruled over a quarter of

845
00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:34.753
empire that mled over a quarter of
the world

846
00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.419
empire that ruled over a quarter of
the world for a very long time. I

847
00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:38.253
the world for a very long time. I
really do not accept you apologising

848
00:27:38.253 --> 00:27:42.253
really do not accept you apologising
or trying to present Boris

849
00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:42.961
really do not accept you apologising
or trying to present BorisJohnson

850
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.503
or trying to present Boris johnson
in a good

851
00:27:43.503 --> 00:27:44.628
or trying to present BorisJohnson
in a good light because I found him

852
00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:44.836
in a good light because Ifound him
deeply

853
00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:50.169
in a good light because I found him
deeply offensive. Robert, do you

854
00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:52.919
deeply offensive. Robert, do you
want to respond to that? I am moving

855
00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:54.628
want to respond to that? I am moving
on in a moment. This is the Prime

856
00:27:54.628 --> 00:27:56.086
on in a moment. This is the Prime
Minister after all, the leader of

857
00:27:56.086 --> 00:27:56.294
Minister after all, the leader of
your

858
00:27:56.294 --> 00:27:56.836
Minister afber all, the leader of
your party.

859
00:27:56.836 --> 00:27:59.169
Minister after all, the leader of
your party. I would say

860
00:27:59.169 --> 00:27:59.669
Minister after all, the leader of
your party. I would sayjournalists

861
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.878
your party. I would say journalists
write

862
00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:01.669
your party. I would sayjournalists
write lots of things and lots of

863
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:03.336
write lots of things and lots of
polemic that they would later come

864
00:28:03.336 --> 00:28:05.336
polemic that they would later come
to regret and not choose to do now.

865
00:28:05.336 --> 00:28:09.669
to regret and not choose to do now.
I would say this... Has the Prime

866
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:11.878
I would say this... Has the Prime
Minister ever said that he regretted

867
00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:15.544
Minister ever said that he regretted
using those terms? I cannot speak

868
00:28:15.544 --> 00:28:15.794
using those terms? I rannot speak
about

869
00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.961
using those terms? I cannot speak
about what might have been written

870
00:28:17.961 --> 00:28:19.794
about what might have been written
15 or so years ago. I have to judge

871
00:28:19.794 --> 00:28:23.711
15 or so years ago. I have to judge
him on his actions as a politician.

872
00:28:23.711 --> 00:28:25.711
him on his actions as a politician.
I see somebody who understands the

873
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:27.128
I see somebody who understands the
challenges we face, accept them and

874
00:28:27.128 --> 00:28:29.669
challenges we face, accept them and
faces up to them and wants to do

875
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:31.503
faces up to them and wants to do
something about them. All right.

876
00:28:31.503 --> 00:28:34.253
something about them. All right.
This is a subject we could talk

877
00:28:34.253 --> 00:28:35.253
This is a subject we could talk
about for the entire programme.

878
00:28:35.253 --> 00:28:36.794
about for the entire programme.
There are a lot of other questions,

879
00:28:36.794 --> 00:28:39.878
There are a lot of other questions,
so I will move on now to Rosenna

880
00:28:39.878 --> 00:28:42.794
so I will move on now to Rosanna
Alim.

881
00:28:42.794 --> 00:28:47.128
so I will move on now to Rosenna
Alim. Good evening. Like myself and

882
00:28:47.128 --> 00:28:48.544
Alim. Good evening. Like myself and
many other independent restaurants,

883
00:28:48.544 --> 00:28:51.544
many other independent restaurants,
our restaurant is very much a family

884
00:28:51.544 --> 00:28:52.253
our restaurant is very much a family
-based and

885
00:28:52.253 --> 00:28:53.711
our restaurant is very much a family
—based and five of our family

886
00:28:53.711 --> 00:28:55.836
—based and five of our family
members are dependent on that

887
00:28:55.836 --> 00:28:59.211
members are dependent on that
business. Since Covid—19 has come

888
00:28:59.211 --> 00:28:59.711
business. Since Covid-19 has come
around, social

889
00:28:59.711 --> 00:29:01.419
business. Since Covid—19 has come
around, social distancing seems to

890
00:29:01.419 --> 00:29:03.253
around, social distancing seems to
be inevitable in hospitality. Once

891
00:29:03.253 --> 00:29:07.919
be inevitable in hospitality. Once
lockdown is lifted we will have 25

892
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:08.253
lockdown is lifted we will have 25
to SON:

893
00:29:08.253 --> 00:29:13.503
lockdown is lifted we will have 25
to 50% of our capacity and we feel

894
00:29:13.503 --> 00:29:13.836
to 5096 of our capacity and we feel
that only

895
00:29:13.836 --> 00:29:15.919
to 50% of our capacity and we feel
that only fixed costs may be

896
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:18.836
that only fixed costs may be
covered, or may not be covered. In

897
00:29:18.836 --> 00:29:22.753
covered, or may not be covered. In
the short—term and long—term what

898
00:29:22.753 --> 00:29:23.169
the short-term and long-term what
strategies will

899
00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:23.711
the short—term and long—term what
strategies will the government and

900
00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:25.461
strategies will the government and
stakeholder organisations put

901
00:29:25.461 --> 00:29:29.711
stakeholder organisations put
forward for our industry? Taken into

902
00:29:29.711 --> 00:29:32.711
forward for our industry? Taken into
account so much debt has been

903
00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:33.544
account so much debt has been
created for independent business

904
00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:38.711
created for independent business
family firms? You mention social

905
00:29:38.711 --> 00:29:39.919
family firms? You mention social
distancing and two metres in this

906
00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:42.711
distancing and two metres in this
country is the acceptable distance.

907
00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:44.503
country is the acceptable distance.
Rocco, I want to come to your first

908
00:29:44.503 --> 00:29:49.961
Rocco, I want to come to your first
with your hotel business. Yes, this

909
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:51.128
with your hotel business. Yes, this
two metres social distancing rule

910
00:29:51.128 --> 00:29:51.461
two metres social distancing mic
has

911
00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:52.919
two metres social distancing rule
has come out of the blue and there

912
00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:56.503
has come out of the blue and there
is no scientific evidence behind it.

913
00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:59.169
is no scientific evidence behind it.
The WTO has come out and said if you

914
00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:01.711
The WTO has come out and said if you
are two metres away, you have 1% of

915
00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:02.711
are two metres away, you have 196 of
catching the

916
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:04.294
are two metres away, you have 1% of
catching the disease will stop if

917
00:30:04.294 --> 00:30:06.753
catching the disease will stop if
you are one metre away, you have a

918
00:30:06.753 --> 00:30:06.919
you are one metre away, you have a
Sin

919
00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:07.128
you are one metre away, you have a
396 chance

920
00:30:07.128 --> 00:30:09.253
you are one metre away, you have a
3% chance of catching the disease.

921
00:30:09.253 --> 00:30:10.003
396 chance of catching the disease.
This is

922
00:30:10.003 --> 00:30:16.919
3% chance of catching the disease.
This is the WHO. Yes. The reality in

923
00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:17.919
This is the WHO. Yes. The reality in
continental Europe which has started

924
00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:20.253
continental Europe which has started
to open up, is they have gone back

925
00:30:20.253 --> 00:30:24.544
to open up, is they have gone back
to one metre. Some of them, not all

926
00:30:24.544 --> 00:30:30.711
to one metre. Some of them, not all
of them. We have got China? Germany

927
00:30:30.711 --> 00:30:34.586
of them. We have got China? Germany
has. Germany is at 1.5 metres, as is

928
00:30:34.586 --> 00:30:36.003
has. Germany is at 1.5 metres, as is
Italy, France and Denmark are at one

929
00:30:36.003 --> 00:30:44.503
Italy, France and Denmark are at one
metre. The reality of this whole

930
00:30:44.503 --> 00:30:46.544
metre. The reality of this whole
thing is no one is concentrating on

931
00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.294
thing is no one is concentrating on
the economic impact of this. The

932
00:30:48.294 --> 00:30:51.878
the economic impact of this. The
reality of this disease which at

933
00:30:51.878 --> 00:30:53.503
reality of this disease which at
first was thought to be a terrible

934
00:30:53.503 --> 00:30:54.711
first was thought to be a terrible
disease and was going to kill

935
00:30:54.711 --> 00:30:57.336
disease and was going to kill
millions of people, it has not

936
00:30:57.336 --> 00:30:57.586
millions of peopla, it has not
turned

937
00:30:57.586 --> 00:31:03.336
millions of people, it has not
turned out to be like that.

938
00:31:05.419 --> 00:31:09.419
turned out to be like that. A lot of
surveys have shown it is 0.1 to 0.2%

939
00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:10.294
surveys have shown it is 0.1 to 0.296
of peopla who

940
00:31:10.294 --> 00:31:12.336
surveys have shown it is 0.1 to 0.2%
of people who die if they catch the

941
00:31:12.336 --> 00:31:13.919
of people who die if they catch the
disease. Other suggestions are it is

942
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:14.128
disease. other suggestions are it is
195

943
00:31:14.128 --> 00:31:14.586
disease. other suggestions are it is
196 and in

944
00:31:14.586 --> 00:31:15.294
disease. Other suggestions are it is
1% and in some countries it is

945
00:31:15.294 --> 00:31:18.294
196 and in some countries it is
higher. The

946
00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:19.586
1% and in some countries it is
higher. The only thorough research

947
00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:24.128
higher. The only thorough research
that has been done has been done by

948
00:31:24.128 --> 00:31:26.169
that has been done has been done by
Stanford or New York, one of the

949
00:31:26.169 --> 00:31:27.586
Stanford or New York, one of the
hotbeds in the United States, and it

950
00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:33.669
hotbeds in the United States, and it
has come out with these figures. The

951
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:37.336
has come out with these figures. The
reality of this disease is the

952
00:31:37.336 --> 00:31:39.169
reality of this disease is the
average age of people who have died

953
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:40.919
average age of people who have died
in this country is 80 and one third

954
00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:43.919
in this country is 80 and one third
of them have died in care homes. It

955
00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:44.711
of them have died in rare homes. It
is a disgrace what

956
00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:45.294
of them have died in care homes. It
is a disgrace what has happened in

957
00:31:45.294 --> 00:31:45.711
is a disgrace what has happened in
the rare

958
00:31:45.711 --> 00:31:49.419
is a disgrace what has happened in
the care homes. But when it comes to

959
00:31:49.419 --> 00:31:49.836
the rare homes. But when it comes to
the hospitality

960
00:31:49.836 --> 00:31:55.044
the care homes. But when it comes to
the hospitality industry, for

961
00:31:55.753 --> 00:31:56.919
the hospitality industry, for
example, and Rosenna is talking

962
00:31:56.919 --> 00:31:57.128
example, and Rosanna is talking
about

963
00:31:57.128 --> 00:31:57.919
example, and Rosenna is talking
about her restaurant, if this

964
00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:01.586
about her restaurant, if this
government sticks to two metres

965
00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.336
government sticks to two metres
social distancing, will it be viable

966
00:32:03.336 --> 00:32:04.253
social distancing, will it be viabla
for you? You

967
00:32:04.253 --> 00:32:04.919
social distancing, will it be viable
for you? You have got hotels around

968
00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:10.544
for you? You have got hotels around
the world. No. A lot of hotels in

969
00:32:10.544 --> 00:32:12.211
the world. No. A lot of hotels in
this country depend on international

970
00:32:12.211 --> 00:32:13.544
this country depend on international
travel and if there is no

971
00:32:13.544 --> 00:32:15.628
travel and if there is no
international travel, they will not

972
00:32:15.628 --> 00:32:17.044
international travel, they will not
have customers and they will not be

973
00:32:17.044 --> 00:32:19.628
have customers and they will not be
able to open. You are opposing the

974
00:32:19.628 --> 00:32:24.378
able to open. You are opposing the
quarantine as well? Yes, of course.

975
00:32:24.378 --> 00:32:26.003
quarantine as well? Yes, of course.
Again, there is no scientific

976
00:32:26.003 --> 00:32:27.586
Again, there is no scientific
evidence behind it. The chief

977
00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:30.253
evidence behind it. The chief
scientific officer says it is a

978
00:32:30.253 --> 00:32:31.919
scientific officer says it is a
political decision and not a

979
00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:33.253
political decision and not a
scientific decision. We are closing

980
00:32:33.253 --> 00:32:35.461
scientific decision. We are closing
down when the rest of Europe is

981
00:32:35.461 --> 00:32:38.211
down when the rest of Europe is
opening up. Until Sunday you could

982
00:32:38.211 --> 00:32:40.378
opening up. Until Sunday you could
come from Iran and Brazil, the two

983
00:32:40.378 --> 00:32:43.336
come from Iran and Brazil, the two
biggest hotbeds of the disease, with

984
00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:45.003
biggest hotbeds of the disease, with
impunity. All of a sudden, no one

985
00:32:45.003 --> 00:32:45.378
impunity. All of a sudden, no one
ran come

986
00:32:45.378 --> 00:32:50.544
impunity. All of a sudden, no one
can come here.

987
00:32:50.544 --> 00:32:54.253
With your hotels in other countries,

988
00:32:54.253 --> 00:32:54.919
with your hotels in other countries,
ran you open

989
00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:55.628
With your hotels in other countries,
can you open economically profitably

990
00:32:55.628 --> 00:32:57.169
ran you open economically profitably
but that

991
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:58.336
can you open economically profitably
but that kind of social distancing?

992
00:32:58.336 --> 00:33:00.211
but that kind of social distancing?
It is still difficult but a metre

993
00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:07.003
It is still difficult but a metre
makes it possible. The tourism

994
00:33:07.003 --> 00:33:07.628
makes it possible. The tourism
industry has suffered

995
00:33:07.628 --> 00:33:08.836
industry has suffered
disproportionately, effectively it

996
00:33:08.836 --> 00:33:11.128
disproportionately, effectively it
has been without income since March

997
00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:13.294
has been without income since March
and it will continue to be without

998
00:33:13.294 --> 00:33:14.336
and it will continue to be without
income in this country until

999
00:33:14.336 --> 00:33:14.461
and it will continue to be without
income in this country untilJuly

1000
00:33:14.461 --> 00:33:15.753
income in this country until july
and that

1001
00:33:15.753 --> 00:33:16.878
income in this country untilJuly
and that is four months, one third

1002
00:33:16.878 --> 00:33:21.544
and that is four months, one third
of the year. Many businesses in the

1003
00:33:21.544 --> 00:33:24.669
of the year. Many businesses in the
tourism industry will go under. You

1004
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:25.794
tourism industry will go under. You
impose quarantine which stops

1005
00:33:25.794 --> 00:33:28.878
impose quarantine which stops
foreigners entering the country,

1006
00:33:28.878 --> 00:33:32.128
foreigners entering the country,
just when there is a chance to save

1007
00:33:32.128 --> 00:33:33.586
just when there is a chance to save
something out of the summer season,

1008
00:33:33.586 --> 00:33:37.003
something out of the summer season,
it is another nail in the coffin,

1009
00:33:37.003 --> 00:33:38.711
it is another nail in the coffin,
the two metre rule makes it

1010
00:33:38.711 --> 00:33:38.836
the two metre mle makes it
impossible

1011
00:33:38.836 --> 00:33:40.003
the two metre rule makes it
impossible for people to open

1012
00:33:40.003 --> 00:33:41.878
impossible for people to open
property.

1013
00:33:41.878 --> 00:33:43.336
impossible for people to open
properly. Fun, when it comes to

1014
00:33:43.336 --> 00:33:43.544
property. Fun, when it comes to
Walas,

1015
00:33:43.544 --> 00:33:43.961
property. Fun, when it comes to
Wales, the

1016
00:33:43.961 --> 00:33:45.128
properly. Fun, when it comes to
Wales, the First Minister says he

1017
00:33:45.128 --> 00:33:49.503
Wales, the First Minister says he
does not expect Welsh tourism to be

1018
00:33:49.503 --> 00:33:50.086
does not expect Welsh tourism to be
mnning this

1019
00:33:50.086 --> 00:33:51.044
does not expect Welsh tourism to be
running this summer, so what do you

1020
00:33:51.044 --> 00:33:51.586
mnning this summer, so what do you
think in

1021
00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:55.961
running this summer, so what do you
think in terms of what Rosina has

1022
00:33:55.961 --> 00:33:58.961
think in terms of what Rosina has
said and what Rocco has said? I am

1023
00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:02.044
said and what Rocco has said? I am
proud of the fact that our priority

1024
00:34:02.044 --> 00:34:04.836
proud of the fact that our priority
is to keep Wales say. We have taken

1025
00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:07.794
is to keep Wales say. We have taken
a deliberately cautious approach of

1026
00:34:07.794 --> 00:34:09.544
a deliberately cautious approach of
easing out of lockdown because I

1027
00:34:09.544 --> 00:34:12.128
easing out of lockdown because I
disagree with Rocco and his

1028
00:34:12.128 --> 00:34:13.961
disagree with Rocco and his
characterisation of Covid—19 and the

1029
00:34:13.961 --> 00:34:14.669
characterisation of Covid-19 and the
impact, it is a

1030
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:16.669
characterisation of Covid—19 and the
impact, it is a dreadful disease, it

1031
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:18.086
impact, it is a dreadful disease, it
has taken tens of thousands of lives

1032
00:34:18.086 --> 00:34:20.836
has taken tens of thousands of lives
across the UK and it would have

1033
00:34:20.836 --> 00:34:23.128
across the UK and it would have
taken more if we had not imposed

1034
00:34:23.128 --> 00:34:26.086
taken more if we had not imposed
lockdown when we did. I don’t think

1035
00:34:26.086 --> 00:34:27.461
lockdown when we did. I don’t think
you ran try to

1036
00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:28.003
lockdown when we did. I don’t think
you can try to balance of health

1037
00:34:28.003 --> 00:34:28.503
you ran try to balance of health
against the

1038
00:34:28.503 --> 00:34:30.628
you can try to balance of health
against the economy, if we come out

1039
00:34:30.628 --> 00:34:32.836
against the economy, if we come out
of lockdown too quickly, we will see

1040
00:34:32.836 --> 00:34:35.294
of lockdown too quickly, we will see
a much greater impact upon our

1041
00:34:35.294 --> 00:34:36.878
a much greater impact upon our
economy. We are looking at a range

1042
00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:41.461
economy. We are looking at a range
of measures that we take, will

1043
00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:43.003
of measures that we take, will
signal more economic activity taking

1044
00:34:43.003 --> 00:34:45.294
signal more economic activity taking
place, but on the basis that we have

1045
00:34:45.294 --> 00:34:47.378
place, but on the basis that we have
to do it in the safest way possible

1046
00:34:47.378 --> 00:34:47.711
to do it in the safest way possibla
and that

1047
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:50.586
to do it in the safest way possible
and that does mean caution. How can

1048
00:34:50.586 --> 00:34:51.003
and that does mean caution. How ran
you help

1049
00:34:51.003 --> 00:34:54.461
and that does mean caution. How can
you help Rosenna? We have a two

1050
00:34:54.461 --> 00:34:55.919
you help Rosenna? We have a two
metre rule in our regulations and we

1051
00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:56.253
metre mle in our regulations and we
have to

1052
00:34:56.253 --> 00:34:57.461
metre rule in our regulations and we
have to consider that we are not

1053
00:34:57.461 --> 00:34:59.169
have to consider that we are not
about to change the law on that

1054
00:34:59.169 --> 00:35:00.461
about to change the law on that
because I think there is good

1055
00:35:00.461 --> 00:35:02.836
because I think there is good
evidence that you are safer, you

1056
00:35:02.836 --> 00:35:04.794
evidence that you are safer, you
have double the risk having a one

1057
00:35:04.794 --> 00:35:07.961
have double the risk having a one
metre rule as opposed to a two metre

1058
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:08.461
metre mle as opposed to a two metre
mle and

1059
00:35:08.461 --> 00:35:10.128
metre rule as opposed to a two metre
rule and the scientific group

1060
00:35:10.128 --> 00:35:11.669
rule and the scientific group
advised on that and I am not about

1061
00:35:11.669 --> 00:35:13.128
advised on that and I am not about
to write --

1062
00:35:13.128 --> 00:35:14.169
advised on that and I am not about
to write —— risk the lives of our

1063
00:35:14.169 --> 00:35:18.586
to write -- risk the lives of our
citizens. The

1064
00:35:18.586 --> 00:35:19.544
to write —— risk the lives of our
citizens. The conclusion of that is

1065
00:35:19.544 --> 00:35:21.753
citizens. The conclusion of that is
that Rosenna’s business might go to

1066
00:35:21.753 --> 00:35:23.544
that Rosenna’s business might go to
the wall. Let us hear from you

1067
00:35:23.544 --> 00:35:28.086
the wall. Let us hear from you
again. I’m not saying about reducing

1068
00:35:28.086 --> 00:35:29.294
again. I’m not saying about reducing
the social distancing, if that is

1069
00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:31.753
the social distancing, if that is
the law, it is the law, but even if

1070
00:35:31.753 --> 00:35:33.794
the law, it is the law, but even if
you reduced it to one metre, I don’t

1071
00:35:33.794 --> 00:35:36.003
you reduced it to one metre, I don’t
think that would make a lot of

1072
00:35:36.003 --> 00:35:38.503
think that would make a lot of
difference, because I think in the

1073
00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:40.086
difference, because I think in the
mind of the consumer, it is very

1074
00:35:40.086 --> 00:35:42.086
mind of the consumer, it is very
much scorched in about the two metre

1075
00:35:42.086 --> 00:35:42.586
much scorched in about the two metre
mle, about

1076
00:35:42.586 --> 00:35:45.044
much scorched in about the two metre
rule, about staying away from other

1077
00:35:45.044 --> 00:35:45.669
mle, about staying away from other
peopla. Even if

1078
00:35:45.669 --> 00:35:47.003
rule, about staying away from other
people. Even if you reduced it to

1079
00:35:47.003 --> 00:35:48.586
people. Even if you reduced it to
half a metre, I think people are

1080
00:35:48.586 --> 00:35:49.253
half a metre, I think peopla are
going to stay

1081
00:35:49.253 --> 00:35:52.253
half a metre, I think people are
going to stay away. The dilemma is

1082
00:35:52.253 --> 00:35:53.003
going to stay away. The dilamma is
not just in the

1083
00:35:53.003 --> 00:35:53.753
going to stay away. The dilemma is
notjust in the next week at

1084
00:35:53.753 --> 00:35:54.003
going to stay away. The dilemma is
not just in the next week at the

1085
00:35:54.003 --> 00:35:56.128
not just in the next week at the
next two weeks of the next month,

1086
00:35:56.128 --> 00:35:58.586
next two weeks of the next month,
this is a longer term problem that

1087
00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:01.378
this is a longer term problem that
hospitality are going to have. Lisa

1088
00:36:01.378 --> 00:36:08.169
hospitality are going to have. Lisa
Marie. In Wales more than 95% of our

1089
00:36:08.169 --> 00:36:09.294
Marie. In Wales more than 95% of our
businesses are small and micro

1090
00:36:09.294 --> 00:36:12.294
businesses are small and micro
businesses and at the moment there

1091
00:36:12.294 --> 00:36:16.336
businesses and at the moment there
are a zero emissions going into one,

1092
00:36:16.336 --> 00:36:18.003
are a zero emissions going into one,
so there is no evidence really to

1093
00:36:18.003 --> 00:36:19.878
so there is no evidence really to
suggest keeping the lockdown in

1094
00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:22.378
suggest keeping the lockdown in
place, but also how are they going

1095
00:36:22.378 --> 00:36:23.836
place, but also how are they going
to take into account the impact this

1096
00:36:23.836 --> 00:36:26.669
to take into account the impact this
is going to have an all these small

1097
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:28.669
is going to have an all these small
businesses and our economy in Wales,

1098
00:36:28.669 --> 00:36:29.961
businesses and our economy in Wales,
which could be severely affected if

1099
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:31.628
which could be severely affected if
we keep some of these guidelines in

1100
00:36:31.628 --> 00:36:35.586
we keep some of these guidelines in
place? I

1101
00:36:35.586 --> 00:36:36.794
we keep some of these guidelines in
place? Ijust want

1102
00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:37.211
we keep some of these guidelines in
place? I just want to jazz,

1103
00:36:37.211 --> 00:36:38.586
we keep some of these guidelines in
place? Ijust want to jazz, once

1104
00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:39.211
place? Ijust want tojau, once
furlough has

1105
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:40.003
place? Ijust want to jazz, once
furlough has ended, she we prepare

1106
00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:47.003
furlough has ended, she we prepare
for mass redundancies? The economy

1107
00:36:47.003 --> 00:36:49.586
for mass redundancies? The economy
in Wales has always been a house of

1108
00:36:49.586 --> 00:36:51.086
in Wales has always been a house of
cards, we are very dependent on the

1109
00:36:51.086 --> 00:36:53.128
cards, we are very dependent on the
pub“:

1110
00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:54.586
cards, we are very dependent on the
public sector and we should have

1111
00:36:54.586 --> 00:36:56.003
public sector and we should have
been leading the way in reopening,

1112
00:36:56.003 --> 00:37:01.628
been leading the way in reopening,
but we are not, we are days and

1113
00:37:01.628 --> 00:37:03.919
but we are not, we are days and
weeks behind what Westminster is

1114
00:37:03.919 --> 00:37:05.586
weeks behind what Westminster is
doing and really, the Welsh Assembly

1115
00:37:05.586 --> 00:37:08.794
doing and really, the Welsh Assembly
sits on its hands for three weeks,

1116
00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:12.503
sits on its hands for three weeks,
in between throwing out a few little

1117
00:37:12.503 --> 00:37:16.211
in between throwing out a few little
tidbits of very minor or trivial

1118
00:37:16.211 --> 00:37:20.253
tidbits of very minor or trivial
relaxing. Looking at the situation

1119
00:37:20.253 --> 00:37:22.961
relaxing. Looking at the situation
in England, Alok Sharma said that

1120
00:37:22.961 --> 00:37:25.086
in England, Alok Sharma said that
three and a half million jobs at

1121
00:37:25.086 --> 00:37:27.169
three and a half million jobs at
risk hospitality sector and the

1122
00:37:27.169 --> 00:37:28.669
risk hospitality sector and the
government is coming under pressure

1123
00:37:28.669 --> 00:37:30.336
government is coming under pressure
from Conservative MPs to do more for

1124
00:37:30.336 --> 00:37:34.628
from Conservative MPs to do more for
businesses like Rosenna’s and reduce

1125
00:37:34.628 --> 00:37:38.336
businesses like Rosenna’s and reduce
to one metre. Rosenna makes an

1126
00:37:38.336 --> 00:37:40.586
to one metre. Rosenna makes an
important point about the confidence

1127
00:37:40.586 --> 00:37:41.711
important point about the confidence
people will have and governments

1128
00:37:41.711 --> 00:37:41.919
peopla will have and governments
will

1129
00:37:41.919 --> 00:37:44.878
people will have and governments
will have regulations and have plans

1130
00:37:44.878 --> 00:37:48.794
will have regulations and have plans
and guidance, but without that

1131
00:37:48.794 --> 00:37:50.211
and guidance, but without that
confidence, then other things will

1132
00:37:50.211 --> 00:37:52.086
confidence, then other things will
happen and I think she is right to

1133
00:37:52.086 --> 00:37:53.503
happen and I think she is right to
remind us that this isn’t going to

1134
00:37:53.503 --> 00:37:55.336
remind us that this isn’t going to
be something that we will have an

1135
00:37:55.336 --> 00:37:57.669
be something that we will have an
end date do and all will be well, we

1136
00:37:57.669 --> 00:37:59.211
end date do and all will be well, we
have extended things like the

1137
00:37:59.211 --> 00:38:01.461
have extended things like the
furlough scheme into October and in

1138
00:38:01.461 --> 00:38:04.628
furlough scheme into October and in
Wales about A18,000 people have been

1139
00:38:04.628 --> 00:38:04.878
Wales about 418,000 people have been
supported

1140
00:38:04.878 --> 00:38:06.086
Wales about A18,000 people have been
supported through various government

1141
00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:07.628
supported through various government
schemes, which is welcome, but this

1142
00:38:07.628 --> 00:38:10.669
schemes, which is welcome, but this
isn’t a problem for weeks or months,

1143
00:38:10.669 --> 00:38:12.711
isn’t a problem for weeks or months,
this is a problem that will endure

1144
00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:14.919
this is a problem that will endure
for a much longer period. I think

1145
00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:16.086
for a much longer period. I think
within government we are right to

1146
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:19.128
within government we are right to
have the debate on the debate is

1147
00:38:19.128 --> 00:38:21.294
have the debate on the debate is
happening across the country,

1148
00:38:21.294 --> 00:38:22.336
happening across the country,
because there are different

1149
00:38:22.336 --> 00:38:23.628
because there are different
international standards, but I think

1150
00:38:23.628 --> 00:38:28.003
international standards, but I think
it is right that we stick to two

1151
00:38:28.003 --> 00:38:30.128
it is right that we stick to two
metres, we have to be clear on that

1152
00:38:30.128 --> 00:38:31.253
metres, we have to be clear on that
and clarity is something that people

1153
00:38:31.253 --> 00:38:34.628
and clarity is something that people
demand from government and whilst it

1154
00:38:34.628 --> 00:38:38.919
demand from government and whilst it
is right of us to consider the

1155
00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:40.128
is right of us to consider the
evidence and constantly evaluate and

1156
00:38:40.128 --> 00:38:41.211
evidence and constantly evaluate and
question and make adjustments, the

1157
00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:44.461
question and make adjustments, the
two metre rule certainly stays for

1158
00:38:44.461 --> 00:38:44.628
two metre mle certainly stays for
the

1159
00:38:44.628 --> 00:38:47.211
two metre rule certainly stays for
the foreseeable and with regard...

1160
00:38:47.211 --> 00:38:48.044
the foreseeabla and with regard...
It is confusing

1161
00:38:48.044 --> 00:38:48.669
the foreseeable and with regard...
It is confusing given that other

1162
00:38:48.669 --> 00:38:51.044
It is confusing given that other
countries are going for a metre and

1163
00:38:51.044 --> 00:38:52.669
countries are going for a metre and
the WHO is suggesting a metre and

1164
00:38:52.669 --> 00:38:57.128
the WHO is suggesting a metre and
others are saying one and a half and

1165
00:38:57.128 --> 00:38:59.878
others are saying one and a half and
it is all one science, so how is

1166
00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:02.461
it is all one science, so how is
that decision made? It is a question

1167
00:39:02.461 --> 00:39:04.544
that decision made? It is a question
of two stages, the evidence and

1168
00:39:04.544 --> 00:39:06.711
of two stages, the evidence and
advice you get from Sage when the

1169
00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:08.169
advice you get from Sage when the
scientists forms part of the

1170
00:39:08.169 --> 00:39:10.086
scientists forms part of the
decision—making that is ultimately

1171
00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:10.628
decision-making that is ultimately
political, the

1172
00:39:10.628 --> 00:39:11.336
decision—making that is ultimately
political, the 2—stage approach and

1173
00:39:11.336 --> 00:39:11.503
political, the 2-stage approach and
there

1174
00:39:11.503 --> 00:39:14.294
political, the 2—stage approach and
there will be a number of different

1175
00:39:14.294 --> 00:39:15.044
there will be a number of different
factors. The challenge for

1176
00:39:15.044 --> 00:39:19.044
factors. The challenge for
government now is that we come out

1177
00:39:19.044 --> 00:39:21.419
government now is that we come out
of this really intense lockdown is

1178
00:39:21.419 --> 00:39:23.336
of this really intense lockdown is
how to get the combination right and

1179
00:39:23.336 --> 00:39:25.586
how to get the combination right and
that is why there has been a big

1180
00:39:25.586 --> 00:39:27.003
that is why there has been a big
debate about the quarantine, clearly

1181
00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:28.086
debate about the quarantine, dearty
at the

1182
00:39:28.086 --> 00:39:30.794
debate about the quarantine, clearly
at the time of the height of the

1183
00:39:30.794 --> 00:39:32.461
at the time of the height of the
outbreak, quarantine would have made

1184
00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:34.711
outbreak, quarantine would have made
no difference but the advice now is

1185
00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:35.711
no difference but the advice now is
that even small adjustments can

1186
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:37.503
that even small adjustments ran
affect

1187
00:39:37.503 --> 00:39:39.003
that even small adjustments can
affect that R number and it is a

1188
00:39:39.003 --> 00:39:41.128
affect that R number and it is a
constant evaluation to see what

1189
00:39:41.128 --> 00:39:42.628
constant evaluation to see what
adjustments we can make to help

1190
00:39:42.628 --> 00:39:43.878
adjustments we ran make to help
people in the

1191
00:39:43.878 --> 00:39:44.461
adjustments we can make to help
people in the same position as

1192
00:39:44.461 --> 00:39:46.544
people in the same position as
Rosenna and to get the balance right

1193
00:39:46.544 --> 00:39:48.669
Rosenna and to get the balance right
between the need to open up and the

1194
00:39:48.669 --> 00:39:50.211
between the need to open up and the
need to save lives as well.

1195
00:39:50.211 --> 00:39:54.294
need to save lives as well.
Bernardine. I don’t know what the

1196
00:39:54.294 --> 00:39:56.128
Bernardine. I don’t know what the
solution is, if the hospitality

1197
00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:57.628
solution is, if the hospitality
industry really does open up, as you

1198
00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:59.169
industry really does open up, as you
would like, Rocco, how do you keep

1199
00:39:59.169 --> 00:40:03.586
would like, Rocco, how do you keep
people safe? You cannot open up with

1200
00:40:03.586 --> 00:40:03.836
peopla safe? You cannot open up with
social

1201
00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:04.878
people safe? You cannot open up with
social distancing, so how do you

1202
00:40:04.878 --> 00:40:05.211
social distancing, so how do you
keep peopla

1203
00:40:05.211 --> 00:40:09.211
social distancing, so how do you
keep people safe? It is up to the

1204
00:40:09.211 --> 00:40:11.294
keep people safe? It is up to the
consumer to decide what he wants to

1205
00:40:11.294 --> 00:40:13.211
consumer to decide what he wants to
do. People have been terrified by

1206
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:17.669
do. People have been terrified by
the government propaganda, and in a

1207
00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:18.128
the government propaganda, and in a
“Y

1208
00:40:18.128 --> 00:40:19.169
the government propaganda, and in a
way that is gradually breaking down

1209
00:40:19.169 --> 00:40:21.044
way that is gradually breaking down
already and you see it with people

1210
00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:21.378
already and you see it with peopla
on the

1211
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:23.253
already and you see it with people
on the beaches and people in the

1212
00:40:23.253 --> 00:40:26.044
on the beaches and people in the
parks, they are not social

1213
00:40:26.044 --> 00:40:27.169
parks, they are not social
distancing into metres. The only

1214
00:40:27.169 --> 00:40:28.586
distancing into metres. The only
place I have seen it happening is

1215
00:40:28.586 --> 00:40:32.669
place I have seen it happening is
here. We are doing it very well. It

1216
00:40:32.669 --> 00:40:33.211
here. We are doing it very well. It
is not just

1217
00:40:33.211 --> 00:40:37.919
here. We are doing it very well. It
is notjust propaganda. It is about

1218
00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:38.086
is not just propaganda. It is about
the

1219
00:40:38.086 --> 00:40:39.086
is notjust propaganda. It is about
the livelihoods of millions of

1220
00:40:39.086 --> 00:40:39.586
the livelihoods of millions of
peopla,

1221
00:40:39.586 --> 00:40:41.211
the livelihoods of millions of
people, we are not talking about

1222
00:40:41.211 --> 00:40:41.419
peopla, we are not talking about
thousands,

1223
00:40:41.419 --> 00:40:42.294
people, we are not talking about
thousands, we are talking about

1224
00:40:42.294 --> 00:40:43.919
thousands, we are talking about
millions of people who are going to

1225
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:44.128
millions of peopla who are going to
lose

1226
00:40:44.128 --> 00:40:45.586
millions of people who are going to
lose their

1227
00:40:45.586 --> 00:40:46.044
millions of peopla who are going to
lose theirjobs

1228
00:40:46.044 --> 00:40:47.836
millions of people who are going to
lose theirjobs and their families

1229
00:40:47.836 --> 00:40:51.294
lose theirjobs and their families
and it will affect their health and

1230
00:40:51.294 --> 00:40:52.003
and it will affect their health and
everything else. You cannot

1231
00:40:52.003 --> 00:40:52.294
and it will affect their health and
everything else. You cannotjust

1232
00:40:52.294 --> 00:40:54.294
everything else. You cannot just
say, sweep it

1233
00:40:54.294 --> 00:40:55.378
everything else. You cannotjust
say, sweep it aside or it is just

1234
00:40:55.378 --> 00:41:01.628
say, sweep it aside or it is just
the economy. What about the resorts

1235
00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:02.044
the economy. what about the resorts
in Wales

1236
00:41:02.044 --> 00:41:03.044
the economy. What about the resorts
in Wales which depend entirely on a

1237
00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:06.086
in Wales which depend entirely on a
summer season? Those people are not

1238
00:41:06.086 --> 00:41:08.711
summer season? Those people are not
going to be able to function. They

1239
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:10.169
going to be able to function. They
are not going to survive. They have

1240
00:41:10.169 --> 00:41:13.836
are not going to survive. They have
had one winter, and they’re going

1241
00:41:13.836 --> 00:41:14.211
had one winter, and therre going
into

1242
00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:15.211
had one winter, and they’re going
into another winter and summer which

1243
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:16.669
into another winter and summer which
should have lifted them up is not

1244
00:41:16.669 --> 00:41:19.086
should have lifted them up is not
going to be there if you carry on

1245
00:41:19.086 --> 00:41:21.169
going to be there if you carry on
like this. All those businesses are

1246
00:41:21.169 --> 00:41:22.628
like this. All those businesses are
going to be devastated, with all the

1247
00:41:22.628 --> 00:41:25.836
going to be devastated, with all the
jobs that go with them. It is not

1248
00:41:25.836 --> 00:41:27.586
jobs that go with them. It is not
just propaganda, I think people are

1249
00:41:27.586 --> 00:41:28.086
just propaganda, I think people are
confused

1250
00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:28.294
just propaganda, I think peopla are
confused by

1251
00:41:28.294 --> 00:41:28.919
just propaganda, I think people are
confused by the different

1252
00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.461
confused by the different
information coming out. You have

1253
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:35.211
information coming out. You have
talked about this report from

1254
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:37.086
talked about this report from
Stanford, no .1, 0.2%. That was not

1255
00:41:37.086 --> 00:41:37.878
Stanford, no .1, 0.296. That was not
peer reviewed

1256
00:41:37.878 --> 00:41:38.378
Stanford, no .1, 0.2%. That was not
peer reviewed another scientists

1257
00:41:38.378 --> 00:41:41.586
peer reviewed another scientists
have come out with different figures

1258
00:41:41.586 --> 00:41:49.086
have come out with different figures
in of statistics. There was a report

1259
00:41:49.086 --> 00:41:49.961
in of statistic. There was a report
leaked by

1260
00:41:49.961 --> 00:41:50.836
in of statistics. There was a report
leaked by experts in the German

1261
00:41:50.836 --> 00:41:53.253
leaked by experts in the German
government which says the chairman

1262
00:41:53.253 --> 00:41:55.919
government which says the chairman
that reaction was completely

1263
00:41:55.919 --> 00:41:56.794
that reaction was completely
over—the—top, it was unnecessary,

1264
00:41:56.794 --> 00:41:57.586
over-the-top, it was unnecessary,
they compared

1265
00:41:57.586 --> 00:42:02.586
over—the—top, it was unnecessary,
they compared it

1266
00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:10.919
they compared it to the the 1918
influenza epidemic which killed

1267
00:42:10.919 --> 00:42:11.503
inﬂuenza epidemic which killed
25,000

1268
00:42:11.503 --> 00:42:12.836
influenza epidemic which killed
25,000 people in Germany on 28,000

1269

25,000 peopla in Germany on 28,000
in this country

1270
00:42:13.503 --> 00:42:14.336
25,000 people in Germany on 28,000
in this country and the economy of

1271
00:42:14.336 --> 00:42:20.503
in this country and the economy of
the world was not lockdown. In 1968

1272
00:42:20.503 --> 00:42:22.669
the world was not lockdown. In 1968
when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong

1273
00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:23.586
when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong
ﬂu which

1274
00:42:23.586 --> 00:42:24.878
when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong
flu which killed over

1275
00:42:24.878 --> 00:42:25.128
when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong
flu which killed overl

1276
00:42:25.128 --> 00:42:25.336
when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong
flu which killed overi million

1277
00:42:25.336 --> 00:42:25.669
ﬂu which killed overl million
peopla

1278
00:42:25.669 --> 00:42:27.086
flu which killed overi million
people worldwide, 80,000 in this

1279
00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:27.461
peopla worldwide, 80,000 in this
country, I

1280
00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:28.086
people worldwide, 80,000 in this
country, I don’t remember anything

1281
00:42:28.086 --> 00:42:33.086
country, I don’t remember anything
about it, it was not talked about.

1282
00:42:33.086 --> 00:42:34.878
about it, it was not talked about.
And we still have excess deaths and

1283
00:42:34.878 --> 00:42:36.503
And we still have excess deaths and
we are the highest country in Europe

1284
00:42:36.503 --> 00:42:39.169
we are the highest country in Europe
for deaths. One of the things that

1285
00:42:39.169 --> 00:42:42.669
for deaths. One of the things that
the public knows and people can make

1286
00:42:42.669 --> 00:42:43.086
the public knows and people ran make
their own

1287
00:42:43.086 --> 00:42:44.253
the public knows and people can make
their own responses and I think this

1288
00:42:44.253 --> 00:42:47.503
their own responses and I think this
is the reason why people are still

1289
00:42:47.503 --> 00:42:49.044
is the reason why people are still
keeping to two metres, Professor

1290
00:42:49.044 --> 00:42:50.711
keeping to two metres, Professor
Niall Ferguson said it, we went into

1291
00:42:50.711 --> 00:42:53.711
Niall Ferguson said it, we went into
lockdown too late and we went into

1292
00:42:53.711 --> 00:42:55.086
lockdown too late and we went into
lockdown too late because Boris

1293
00:42:55.086 --> 00:42:55.211
lockdown too late because Boris
johnson

1294
00:42:55.211 --> 00:42:56.503
lockdown too late because Boris
Johnson likes to think that he will

1295
00:42:56.503 --> 00:42:57.503
johnson likes to think that he will
let peopla

1296
00:42:57.503 --> 00:42:59.211
Johnson likes to think that he will
let people do what they want to do

1297
00:42:59.211 --> 00:43:00.128
let peopla do what they want to do
and he is

1298
00:43:00.128 --> 00:43:01.669
let people do what they want to do
and he is reluctant to take

1299
00:43:01.669 --> 00:43:04.086
and he is reluctant to take
criticisms on this. Here in Wales I

1300
00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:04.669
criticisms on this. Here in Walas I
deeply fear

1301
00:43:04.669 --> 00:43:05.711
criticisms on this. Here in Wales I
deeply fear when the furlough scheme

1302
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:08.003
deeply fear when the furlough scheme
is starting to scale down, it starts

1303
00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:10.128
is starting to scale down, it starts
to scale down in August when

1304
00:43:10.128 --> 00:43:11.294
to scale down in August when
businesses are responsible for

1305
00:43:11.294 --> 00:43:13.169
businesses are responsible for
taking on their National Insurance

1306
00:43:13.169 --> 00:43:16.211
taking on their National Insurance
and pensions, we have 74% of our

1307
00:43:16.211 --> 00:43:16.419
and pensions, we have 7496 of our
businesses,

1308
00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:17.211
and pensions, we have 74% of our
businesses, who are using the

1309
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:21.628
businesses, who are using the
furlough scheme. And of course I

1310
00:43:21.628 --> 00:43:24.211
furlough scheme. And of course I
represent an area which is deeply

1311
00:43:24.211 --> 00:43:25.586
represent an area which is deeply
dependent on the tourism industry. I

1312
00:43:25.586 --> 00:43:27.503
dependent on the tourism industry. I
fear what is going to happen with

1313
00:43:27.503 --> 00:43:31.753
fear what is going to happen with
that industry and I talk to people,

1314
00:43:31.753 --> 00:43:32.461
that industry and I talk to peopla,
a railway, a

1315
00:43:32.461 --> 00:43:34.669
that industry and I talk to people,
a railway, a jewel in the crown of

1316
00:43:34.669 --> 00:43:36.086
a railway, a jewel in the crown of
the heritage railways and they are

1317
00:43:36.086 --> 00:43:38.503
the heritage railways and they are
facing what they called the three

1318
00:43:38.503 --> 00:43:40.294
facing what they called the three
winter scenario and when the

1319
00:43:40.294 --> 00:43:41.461
winter scenario and when the
furlough scheme ceases, regardless

1320
00:43:41.461 --> 00:43:43.378
furlough scheme ceases, regardless
of what the Welsh Government says

1321
00:43:43.378 --> 00:43:45.711
of what the Welsh Government says
because they have not got the means

1322
00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:47.378
because they have not got the means
of funding their own policies, they

1323
00:43:47.378 --> 00:43:49.336
of funding their own policies, they
are going to be facing a situation

1324
00:43:49.336 --> 00:43:50.836
are going to be facing a situation
and many other businesses, where

1325
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:52.378
and many other businesses, where
they will be making redundancies

1326
00:43:52.378 --> 00:43:54.294
they will be making redundancies
this summer. This is the three

1327
00:43:54.294 --> 00:43:56.711
this summer. This is the three
winter scenario and to come back to

1328
00:43:56.711 --> 00:43:58.919
winter scenario and to come back to
the question of public confidence,

1329
00:43:58.919 --> 00:44:00.169
the question of public confidence,
because it will be public confidence

1330
00:44:00.169 --> 00:44:04.169
because it will be public confidence
that changes this, we need an

1331
00:44:04.169 --> 00:44:05.586
that changes this, we need an
effective Test and Trace system in

1332
00:44:05.586 --> 00:44:08.919
effective Test and Trace system in
place, that is seen by people to

1333
00:44:08.919 --> 00:44:11.919
place, that is seen by people to
work, both in Wales and in England

1334
00:44:11.919 --> 00:44:12.919
work, both in Walas and in England
and until

1335
00:44:12.919 --> 00:44:13.586
work, both in Wales and in England
and until people have that

1336
00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:15.086
and until people have that
confidence, then we are going to see

1337
00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:18.211
confidence, then we are going to see
the same problem coming up.

1338
00:44:18.211 --> 00:44:20.294
the same problem coming up.
Alongside this, I beg at both our

1339
00:44:20.294 --> 00:44:22.044
Alongside this, I beg at both our
governments, the Welsh Government

1340
00:44:22.044 --> 00:44:23.461
governments, the Welsh Government
and the UK Government, the English

1341
00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:26.086
and the UK Government, the English
government in this respect, look at

1342
00:44:26.086 --> 00:44:28.003
government in this respect, look at
what is happening to our tourism and

1343
00:44:28.003 --> 00:44:29.503
what is happening to our tourism and
hospitality industry and look at our

1344
00:44:29.503 --> 00:44:31.169
hospitality industry and look at our
dependence on this, these people

1345
00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.336
dependence on this, these people
will go out of business and there

1346
00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:34.919
will go out of business and there
will be immense suffering in terms

1347
00:44:34.919 --> 00:44:36.336
will be immense suffering in terms
of unemployment, please do not pull

1348
00:44:36.336 --> 00:44:38.128
of unemployment, please do not pull
the wool over our eyes, we need

1349
00:44:38.128 --> 00:44:39.586
the wool over our eyes, we need
these industries into the future and

1350
00:44:39.586 --> 00:44:41.336
these industries into the future and
I fear what will happen in the

1351
00:44:41.336 --> 00:44:44.086
I fear what will happen in the
summer. You mention testing and we

1352
00:44:44.086 --> 00:44:49.753
summer. You mention testing and we
have a question on that.

1353
00:44:49.794 --> 00:44:52.586
have a question on that. We have
recruited 25,000 contact tracers,

1354
00:44:52.586 --> 00:44:54.253
recruited 25,000 contact tracers,
however with the Test and Trace

1355
00:44:54.253 --> 00:44:55.794
however with the Test and Trace
results showing that a third of the

1356
00:44:55.794 --> 00:44:56.294
results showing that a third of the
peopla who

1357
00:44:56.294 --> 00:44:57.503
results showing that a third of the
people who are testing positive are

1358
00:44:57.503 --> 00:44:58.169
peopla who are testing positive are
not providing

1359
00:44:58.169 --> 00:45:00.169
people who are testing positive are
not providing any details for those

1360
00:45:00.169 --> 00:45:01.878
not providing any details for those
close contacts, is the system good

1361
00:45:01.878 --> 00:45:05.669
close contacts, is the system good
enough and is it up to scratch?

1362
00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:07.586
enough and is it up to scratch?
Robert, I will come to you on that

1363
00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:10.878
Robert, I will come to you on that
because we have had the figures out

1364
00:45:10.878 --> 00:45:12.586
because we have had the figures out
today from Matt Hancock. Vaughan,

1365
00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:13.586
today from Matt Hancock. Vaughan,
ran I start

1366
00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:14.211
today from Matt Hancock. Vaughan,
can I start with you. Contact

1367
00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:14.628
ran I start with you. Contact
tracing has

1368
00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:15.544
can I start with you. Contact
tracing has been happening in Wales

1369
00:45:15.544 --> 00:45:17.628
tracing has been happening in Wales
for some time but what I do not know

1370
00:45:17.628 --> 00:45:21.753
for some time but what I do not know
is how many people are actually

1371
00:45:21.753 --> 00:45:22.044
is how many peopla are actually
being

1372
00:45:22.044 --> 00:45:23.544
is how many people are actually
being contacted and agreeing to hand

1373
00:45:23.544 --> 00:45:24.044
being contacted and agreeing to hand
over their contacts,

1374
00:45:24.044 --> 00:45:24.336
being contacted and agreeing to hand
overtheir contacts, is

1375
00:45:24.336 --> 00:45:28.044
being contacted and agreeing to hand
over their contacts, is that right?

1376
00:45:28.044 --> 00:45:30.503
over their contacts, is that right?
We have not had a proper report at

1377
00:45:30.503 --> 00:45:34.003
We have not had a proper report at
all. I had a meeting about our

1378
00:45:34.003 --> 00:45:35.253
all. I had a meeting about our
system today with our oversight

1379
00:45:35.253 --> 00:45:35.419
system today with our oversight
EWUP

1380
00:45:35.419 --> 00:45:37.044
system today with our oversight
group and we have had a good start

1381
00:45:37.044 --> 00:45:41.544
group and we have had a good start
that partly because we have got low

1382
00:45:41.544 --> 00:45:43.169
that partly because we have got low
numbers, less than 100 G infections

1383
00:45:43.169 --> 00:45:43.628
numbers, lass than 100 G infections
today and

1384
00:45:43.628 --> 00:45:46.419
numbers, less than 100 G infections
today and we don’t have any kind of

1385
00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:47.961
today and we don’t have any kind of
significant number of people not

1386
00:45:47.961 --> 00:45:48.419
significant number of peopla not
giving their

1387
00:45:48.419 --> 00:45:50.378
significant number of people not
giving their data, in the first week

1388
00:45:50.378 --> 00:45:53.628
giving their data, in the first week
of publication, there were 659

1389
00:45:53.628 --> 00:45:58.586
of publication, there were 659
contacts identified and we gave

1390
00:45:58.586 --> 00:46:00.211
contacts identified and we gave
advice to 619 of those contacts,

1391
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:04.586
advice to 619 of those contacts,
that is a contact rate of 94% and we

1392
00:46:04.586 --> 00:46:05.044
that is a contact rate of 9496 and we
have an

1393
00:46:05.044 --> 00:46:06.503
that is a contact rate of 94% and we
have an effective system and we have

1394
00:46:06.503 --> 00:46:07.794
have an effective system and we have
delivered that in partnership

1395
00:46:07.794 --> 00:46:10.628
delivered that in partnership
between the National Health Service

1396
00:46:10.628 --> 00:46:13.628
between the National Health Service
and the authorities and I think the

1397
00:46:13.628 --> 00:46:15.419
and the authorities and I think the
question really describes the

1398
00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:16.836
question really describes the
position in England. In Wales, we

1399
00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:17.253
position in England. In Walas, we
have

1400
00:46:17.253 --> 00:46:18.253
position in England. In Wales, we
have been much more effective and

1401
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:20.461
have been much more effective and
the challenge is how we continue to

1402
00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:22.878
the challenge is how we continue to
do that as we progressively unlock

1403
00:46:22.878 --> 00:46:24.586
do that as we progressively unlock
more activity when it is safe to do

1404
00:46:24.586 --> 00:46:27.586
more activity when it is safe to do
so. Here in Wales, I think we have a

1405
00:46:27.586 --> 00:46:28.669
so. Here in Walas, I think we have a
good story to tell

1406
00:46:28.669 --> 00:46:29.169
so. Here in Wales, I think we have a
good story to tell about contact

1407
00:46:29.169 --> 00:46:31.044
good story to tell about contact
tracing and I am proud that will

1408
00:46:31.044 --> 00:46:33.044
tracing and I am proud that will
what we are doing to deliver that

1409
00:46:33.044 --> 00:46:35.169
what we are doing to deliver that
service to keep Wales say.

1410
00:46:39.794 --> 00:46:40.003
m

1411
00:46:40.003 --> 00:46:46.336
Do you agree? We know that we had to
give up on targets because we know

1412
00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.961
give up on targets because we know
they were impossible to reach on

1413
00:46:47.961 --> 00:46:51.794
they were impossible to reach on
testing. I would go back to the rush

1414
00:46:51.794 --> 00:46:52.919
testing. I would go back to the rush
testing on contact. We know

1415
00:46:52.919 --> 00:46:55.003
testing on contact. We know
thousands of tests were taken away

1416
00:46:55.003 --> 00:46:56.711
thousands of tests were taken away
from Wales by the UK Government and

1417
00:46:56.711 --> 00:46:58.419
from Wales by the UK Government and
for some reason I think the people

1418
00:46:58.419 --> 00:46:58.753
for some reason I think the peopla
of Walas

1419
00:46:58.753 --> 00:47:00.711
for some reason I think the people
of Wales deserve to hear the full

1420
00:47:00.711 --> 00:47:02.461
of Wales deserve to hear the full
story of this, and yet I understand

1421
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:04.711
story of this, and yet I understand
you are not releasing the actual

1422
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:06.128
you are not releasing the actual
e-mail

1423
00:47:06.128 --> 00:47:06.961
you are not releasing the actual
e—mail correspondence that was the

1424
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:07.336
e-mail correspondence that was the
reason as

1425
00:47:07.336 --> 00:47:09.211
e—mail correspondence that was the
reason as to why we do not have

1426
00:47:09.211 --> 00:47:11.586
reason as to why we do not have
these tests in Wales. Over and above

1427
00:47:11.586 --> 00:47:17.378
these tests in Wales. Over and above
that, representing highly rural

that, representing highly mral

1429

that, representing highly rural

1430
00:47:19.586 --> 00:47:20.003

has been

has been in special measures for

1432
00:47:20.794 --> 00:47:24.169
has been in special measures for
five years, people cannot get the

1433
00:47:24.169 --> 00:47:25.711
five years, people cannot get the
results from their tests back again.

1434
00:47:25.711 --> 00:47:29.378
results from their tests back again.
I am sad to say that we have had

1435
00:47:29.378 --> 00:47:29.461
lam sadtosaythatwe have had
these

1436
00:47:29.461 --> 00:47:31.794
I am sad to say that we have had
these stories, but when it comes to

1437
00:47:31.794 --> 00:47:32.669
these stories, but when it comes to
people’s experience on the ground

1438
00:47:32.669 --> 00:47:35.586
people’s experience on the ground
and the critical way we need to get

1439
00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:36.711
and the critical way we need to get
people’s confidence back, they need

1440
00:47:36.711 --> 00:47:39.211
people’s confidence back, they need
to see the test working, that is the

1441
00:47:39.211 --> 00:47:42.253
to see the test working, that is the
only way it will unlock people’s

1442
00:47:42.253 --> 00:47:43.378
only way it will unlock people’s
confidence and unlock our economy.

1443
00:47:43.378 --> 00:47:45.586
confidence and unlock our economy.
There are facts to deal with their

1444
00:47:45.586 --> 00:47:46.503
There are facts to deal with their
if I may. when

1445
00:47:46.503 --> 00:47:47.794
There are facts to deal with their
if I may. When it comes to test

1446
00:47:47.794 --> 00:47:48.503
if I may. when it comes to test
results in

1447
00:47:48.503 --> 00:47:50.836
if I may. When it comes to test
results in Wales, over 90% of people

1448
00:47:50.836 --> 00:47:51.003
results in Walas, over 9096 of peopla
get

1449
00:47:51.003 --> 00:47:53.044
results in Wales, over 9096 of people
get their tests

1450
00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:53.711
results in Wales, over 90% of people
get their tests within 48 hours. The

1451
00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:56.253
get their tests within 48 hours. The
idea this is widespread does not

1452
00:47:56.253 --> 00:47:58.544
idea this is widespread does not
match the facts. When it comes to

1453
00:47:58.544 --> 00:47:59.003
match the facts. when it comes to
our testing

1454
00:47:59.003 --> 00:48:01.086
match the facts. When it comes to
our testing capacity, the review I

1455
00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:06.628
our testing capacity, the review I
ordered revealed we could not meet

1456
00:48:06.628 --> 00:48:07.003
ordered revealed we could not meet
those earty

1457
00:48:07.003 --> 00:48:07.336
ordered revealed we could not meet
those early aspirations because

1458
00:48:07.336 --> 00:48:07.586
those earty aspirations because
equipment

1459
00:48:07.586 --> 00:48:09.919
those early aspirations because
equipment was delayed in other

1460
00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:11.336
equipment was delayed in other
countries and some countries stopped

1461
00:48:11.336 --> 00:48:13.794
countries and some countries stopped
the export of testing equipment. We

1462
00:48:13.794 --> 00:48:15.794
the export of testing equipment. We
are in a better place, we are well

1463
00:48:15.794 --> 00:48:19.503
are in a better place, we are well
over 12,000 tests. If that was for

1464
00:48:19.503 --> 00:48:22.419
over 12,000 tests. If that was for
the whole of the UK, we would have

1465
00:48:22.419 --> 00:48:28.753
the whole of the UK, we would have
capacity of well over 260,000 tests.

1466
00:48:28.753 --> 00:48:31.753
capacity of well over 260,000 tests.
We have successfully implemented a

1467
00:48:31.753 --> 00:48:31.878
We have successfuuy implamented a
programme

1468
00:48:31.878 --> 00:48:33.586
We have successfully implemented a
programme and when it comes to test

1469
00:48:33.586 --> 00:48:34.878
programme and when it comes to test
results we are in a decent place,

1470
00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.711
results we are in a decent place,
but I want to see us get better

1471
00:48:36.711 --> 00:48:39.586
but I want to see us get better
which will help us maintain public

1472
00:48:39.586 --> 00:48:44.003
which will help us maintain public
confidence. I am committed to

1473
00:48:44.003 --> 00:48:45.336
confidence. I am committed to
understanding what we can do to make

1474
00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:46.586
understanding what we ran do to make
it better,

1475
00:48:46.586 --> 00:48:47.544
understanding what we can do to make
it better, openly publishing the

1476
00:48:47.544 --> 00:48:49.211
it better, openly publishing the
data we have, and to give that

1477
00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:52.586
data we have, and to give that
confidence to people. The facts do

1478
00:48:52.586 --> 00:48:52.878
confidence to peopla. The facts do
not bear

1479
00:48:52.878 --> 00:48:53.961
confidence to people. The facts do
not bear out the comments Liz has

1480
00:48:53.961 --> 00:48:58.211
not bear out the comments Liz has
actually made. Contact testing was

1481
00:48:58.211 --> 00:48:59.419
actually made. Contact testing was
started in Wales and stopped

1482
00:48:59.419 --> 00:49:00.919
started in Wales and stopped
immediately. The only place where it

1483
00:49:00.919 --> 00:49:04.211
immediately. The only place where it
carried on was Ceredigion where they

1484
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:06.336
carried on was Ceredigion where they
have had the lowest deaths in the

1485
00:49:06.336 --> 00:49:10.336
have had the lowest deaths in the
lowest rates. Let’s come back to

1486
00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:15.586
lowest rates. Let’s come back to
Shakeel’s question. As with every

1487
00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:20.086
Shakeel’s question. As with every
part of the UK we stopped contact

1488
00:49:20.086 --> 00:49:21.878
part of the UK we stopped contact
tracing in the early part of the

1489
00:49:21.878 --> 00:49:22.169
tracing in the earty part of the
pandemic

1490
00:49:22.169 --> 00:49:23.669
tracing in the early part of the
pandemic because we did not have the

1491
00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:25.211
pandemic because we did not have the
resources to carry on doing it. That

1492
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:28.669
resources to carry on doing it. That
is the truth of the matter. I wish

1493
00:49:28.669 --> 00:49:30.586
is the truth of the matter. I wish
we had greater capacity to make a

1494
00:49:30.586 --> 00:49:34.294
we had greater capacity to make a
different choice, but we made

1495
00:49:34.294 --> 00:49:36.628
different choice, but we made
choices and we are making choices

1496
00:49:36.628 --> 00:49:38.753
choices and we are making choices
now about how we keep people safe

1497
00:49:38.753 --> 00:49:39.961
now about how we keep people safe
and we are doing a decent

1498
00:49:39.961 --> 00:49:40.503
now about how we keep people safe
and we are doing a decentjob

1499
00:49:40.503 --> 00:49:42.086
and we are doing a decentjob
compared to other parts of the

1500
00:49:42.086 --> 00:49:44.211
compared to other parts of the
country. Let me go back to the

1501
00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:47.461
country. Let me go back to the
question, which is talking about the

1502
00:49:47.461 --> 00:49:51.836
question, which is talking about the
25,000 contact tracers in England

1503
00:49:51.836 --> 00:49:53.128
25,000 contact tracers in England
with todars

1504
00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:53.919
25,000 contact tracers in England
with today’s test and trace results

1505
00:49:53.919 --> 00:49:54.586
with todars test and trace results
showing a

1506
00:49:54.586 --> 00:49:55.961
with today’s test and trace results
showing a third of the people who

1507
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:58.211
showing a third of the people who
tested positive are not handed over

1508
00:49:58.211 --> 00:50:00.419
tested positive are not handed over
their contacts to be traced and then

1509
00:50:00.419 --> 00:50:03.169
their contacts to be traced and then
isolate. Is that good enough? I

1510
00:50:03.169 --> 00:50:05.586
isolate. Is that good enough? I
think we can do even more. Let’s

1511
00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:05.711
think we ran do even more. Let’s
remember

1512
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:06.794
think we can do even more. Let’s
remember that meant two thirds did

1513
00:50:06.794 --> 00:50:10.253
remember that meant two thirds did
the right thing and of that two

1514
00:50:10.253 --> 00:50:11.253
the right thing and of that two
thirds, 85% then confirmed they

1515
00:50:11.253 --> 00:50:11.544
thirds, 5596 then confirmed they
would

1516
00:50:11.544 --> 00:50:14.711
thirds, 85% then confirmed they
would self—isolate. That is nearly

1517
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:14.878
would self-isolate. That is hearty
27,000

1518
00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:17.794
would self—isolate. That is nearly
27,000 people who will now have the

1519
00:50:17.794 --> 00:50:20.211
27,000 people who will now have the
benefit of the system. What about

1520
00:50:20.211 --> 00:50:20.336
benefit of the system. what about
the

1521
00:50:20.336 --> 00:50:21.836
benefit of the system. What about
the third that Shakeel is talking

1522
00:50:21.836 --> 00:50:24.128
the third that Shakeel is talking
about? He is right to draw our

1523
00:50:24.128 --> 00:50:25.544
about? He is right to draw our
attention to the fact that there are

1524
00:50:25.544 --> 00:50:26.544
attention to the fact that there are
still people who are not

1525
00:50:26.544 --> 00:50:32.586
still people who are not
cooperating. Are you concerned? I am

1526
00:50:32.586 --> 00:50:34.211
cooperating. Are you concerned? I am
concerned about that, it is all of

1527
00:50:34.211 --> 00:50:36.169
concerned about that, it is all of
our collective duty to work with the

1528
00:50:36.169 --> 00:50:36.794
our collactive duty to work with the
authorities,

1529
00:50:36.794 --> 00:50:38.753
our collective duty to work with the
authorities, to do everything we can

1530
00:50:38.753 --> 00:50:39.919
authorities, to do everything we ran
to do our part.

1531
00:50:39.919 --> 00:50:41.211
authorities, to do everything we can
to do our part. We have got to get

1532
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:43.336
to do our part. We have got to get
the message over again and again

1533
00:50:43.336 --> 00:50:45.919
the message over again and again
about the importance of sharing that

1534
00:50:45.919 --> 00:50:47.961
about the importance of sharing that
information and we share it in a

1535
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:50.378
information and we share it in a
voluntary way, but we do it in a

1536
00:50:50.378 --> 00:50:52.461
voluntary way, but we do it in a
spirit of collective coming together

1537
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:53.086
spirit of collactive coming together
to fight this

1538
00:50:53.086 --> 00:50:54.294
spirit of collective coming together
to fight this virus. I think this is

1539
00:50:54.294 --> 00:50:54.919
to fight this vims. I think this is
only the first

1540
00:50:54.919 --> 00:50:57.294
to fight this virus. I think this is
only the first week. I mentioned it

1541
00:50:57.294 --> 00:51:01.961
only the first week. I mentioned it
simply because the minutes that came

1542
00:51:01.961 --> 00:51:03.294
simply because the minutes that came
out from Sage, the scientific body

1543
00:51:03.294 --> 00:51:06.253
out from Sage, the scientific body
advising the government, saying that

1544
00:51:06.253 --> 00:51:06.586
advising the government, saying that
801: of

1545
00:51:06.586 --> 00:51:08.419
advising the government, saying that
80% of contacts need to be traced in

1546
00:51:08.419 --> 00:51:08.711
8096 of contacts need to be traced in
order for

1547
00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:10.253
80% of contacts need to be traced in
order for this system to be

1548
00:51:10.253 --> 00:51:12.086
order for this system to be
effective. If a third of the people

1549
00:51:12.086 --> 00:51:13.586
effective. If a third of the people
are not handed over their contacts

1550
00:51:13.586 --> 00:51:15.419
are not handed over their contacts
at all, you will not get anywhere

1551
00:51:15.419 --> 00:51:18.753
at all, you will not get anywhere
near that, will you? We need to do

1552
00:51:18.753 --> 00:51:20.961
near that, will you? We need to do
better and I think in the first week

1553
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:22.544
better and I think in the first week
that is encouraging, but I very much

1554
00:51:22.544 --> 00:51:26.503
that is encouraging, but I very much
hope and I would expect that as we

1555
00:51:26.503 --> 00:51:29.753
hope and I would expect that as we
all get more used to it, then the

1556
00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.586
all get more used to it, then the
new normal will start to apply and

1557
00:51:32.586 --> 00:51:33.794
new normal will start to apply and
peopla will

1558
00:51:33.794 --> 00:51:34.753
new normal will start to apply and
people will see the advantage in

1559
00:51:34.753 --> 00:51:35.169
peopla will see the advantage in
sharing that

1560
00:51:35.169 --> 00:51:35.711
people will see the advantage in
sharing that information and doing

1561
00:51:35.711 --> 00:51:38.419
sharing that information and doing
the right thing, because

1562
00:51:38.419 --> 00:51:41.253
the right thing, because
cumulatively, as we found in

1563
00:51:41.253 --> 00:51:42.794
cumulatively, as we found in
lockdown, we can use this system to

1564
00:51:42.794 --> 00:51:42.878
lockdown, we ran use this system to
continue

1565
00:51:42.878 --> 00:51:43.753
lockdown, we can use this system to
continue the fight against the

1566
00:51:43.753 --> 00:51:44.794
continue the fight against the
vims.

1567
00:51:44.794 --> 00:51:50.294
continue the fight against the
virus. Ross. Do you think there is a

1568
00:51:50.294 --> 00:51:50.836
vims. Ross. Do you think there is a
correlation

1569
00:51:50.836 --> 00:51:52.753
virus. Ross. Do you think there is a
correlation between the confidence

1570
00:51:52.753 --> 00:51:54.253
correlation between the confidence
in how the government has dealt with

1571
00:51:54.253 --> 00:51:58.669
in how the government has dealt with
this pandemic, connecting that with

1572
00:51:58.669 --> 00:52:01.044
this pandemic, connecting that with
the third that do not give any of

1573
00:52:01.044 --> 00:52:02.253
the third that do not give any of
their details with the track and

1574
00:52:02.253 --> 00:52:06.003
their details with the track and
trace? I love the fact he is calling

1575
00:52:06.003 --> 00:52:09.419
trace? I love the fact he is calling
you Rob as well. Thank you very

1576
00:52:09.419 --> 00:52:11.211
you Rob as well. Thank you very
much, a lot of people do. I think

1577
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:11.711
much, a lot of peopla do. I think
that is an

1578
00:52:11.711 --> 00:52:14.503
much, a lot of people do. I think
that is an important point. He

1579
00:52:14.503 --> 00:52:15.794
that is an important point. He
talked about confidence. Is he

1580
00:52:15.794 --> 00:52:19.378
talked about confidence. Is he
right? We have got to ask ourselves

1581
00:52:19.378 --> 00:52:20.628
right? We have got to ask ourselves
the question are people doing it

1582
00:52:20.628 --> 00:52:22.628
the question are people doing it
because they do not want to

1583
00:52:22.628 --> 00:52:24.628
because they do not want to
cooperate, they value perhaps their

1584
00:52:24.628 --> 00:52:26.419
cooperate, they value perhaps their
own privacy? Or they have lost

1585
00:52:26.419 --> 00:52:27.919
own privacy? Or they have lost
tmst? I

1586
00:52:27.919 --> 00:52:29.461
own privacy? Or they have lost
trust? I am dealing with the point.

1587
00:52:29.461 --> 00:52:30.836
tmst? I am dealing with the point.
I think

1588
00:52:30.836 --> 00:52:31.836
trust? I am dealing with the point.
I think there is still, actually,

1589
00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:33.794
I think there is still, actually,
from all the evidence I am seeing a

1590
00:52:33.794 --> 00:52:37.044
from all the evidence I am seeing a
high degree... People are not doing

1591
00:52:37.044 --> 00:52:39.919
high degree... People are not doing
it because the government are

1592
00:52:39.919 --> 00:52:41.919
it because the government are
telling them to do it, people are

1593
00:52:41.919 --> 00:52:42.294
telling them to do it, peopla are
doing it

1594
00:52:42.294 --> 00:52:44.836
telling them to do it, people are
doing it because they know from

1595
00:52:44.836 --> 00:52:45.919
doing it because they know from
their own information, research and

1596
00:52:45.919 --> 00:52:48.003
their own information, research and
understanding that it is the right

1597
00:52:48.003 --> 00:52:49.461
understanding that it is the right
thing to do. I never underestimated

1598
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:52.711
thing to do. I never underestimated
the sense of the Welsh public or the

1599
00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:54.294
the sense of the Welsh public or the
British public to do the right

1600
00:52:54.294 --> 00:52:56.419
British public to do the right
thing. You will always have a

1601
00:52:56.419 --> 00:52:58.169
thing. You will always have a
minority perhaps who will not, but

1602
00:52:58.169 --> 00:53:00.919
minority perhaps who will not, but
the majority can be trusted.

1603
00:53:00.919 --> 00:53:01.128
the majority ran be tmsted.
Frankly,

1604
00:53:01.128 --> 00:53:01.336
the majority can be trusted.
Frankly, rather

1605
00:53:01.336 --> 00:53:02.294
the majority can be trusted.
Frankly, ratherthan

1606
00:53:02.294 --> 00:53:03.586
the majority can be trusted.
Frankly, rather than blind trust in

1607
00:53:03.586 --> 00:53:03.753
Frankly, rather than blind tmst in
government,

1608
00:53:03.753 --> 00:53:04.711
Frankly, rather than blind trust in
government, the government should be

1609
00:53:04.711 --> 00:53:05.086
government, the government should be
tmsting people

1610
00:53:05.086 --> 00:53:05.961
government, the government should be
trusting people to do the right

1611
00:53:05.961 --> 00:53:08.919
trusting peopla to do the right
thing. what

1612
00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:09.544
trusting people to do the right
thing. What would Dominic Cummings

1613
00:53:09.544 --> 00:53:13.003
thing. what would Dominic Cummings
do? Let’s

1614
00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:14.378
thing. What would Dominic Cummings
do? Let’s not talk about individuals

1615
00:53:14.378 --> 00:53:15.753
do? Let’s not talk about individuals
now, let’s raise the level of the

1616
00:53:15.753 --> 00:53:18.211
now, let’s raise the level of the
debate stop let me get around the

1617
00:53:18.211 --> 00:53:22.794
debate stop let me get around the
rest of the palace. Bernadine, what

1618
00:53:22.794 --> 00:53:24.711
rest of the palace. Bernadine, what
do you think? I think there is a

1619
00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:26.669
do you think? I think there is a
privacy issue and I think there is a

1620
00:53:26.669 --> 00:53:29.253
privacy issue and I think there is a
trust issue. I agree with Ross. I

1621
00:53:29.253 --> 00:53:30.003
trust issue. Iagree with Ross. I
have not

1622
00:53:30.003 --> 00:53:31.294
trust issue. I agree with Ross. I
have not taken my lead from this

1623
00:53:31.294 --> 00:53:33.253
have not taken my lead from this
government in terms of the pandemic.

1624
00:53:33.253 --> 00:53:35.419
government in terms of the pandemic.
I went into lockdown some ten days

1625
00:53:35.419 --> 00:53:37.794
I went into lockdown some ten days
before the government told me to

1626
00:53:37.794 --> 00:53:39.003
before the government told me to
because it was glaringly obvious to

1627
00:53:39.003 --> 00:53:41.878
because it was glaringly obvious to
me that I should do. I might have

1628
00:53:41.878 --> 00:53:44.711
me that I should do. I might have
saved my life, I don’t know. I was

1629
00:53:44.711 --> 00:53:44.919
saved my life, I don’t know. Iwas
“P

1630
00:53:44.919 --> 00:53:45.086
saved my life, I don’t know. Iwas
up around

1631
00:53:45.086 --> 00:53:47.211
saved my life, I don’t know. I was
up around London on the tube all the

1632
00:53:47.211 --> 00:53:50.294
up around London on the tube all the
time. The week before I went into

1633
00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:52.336
time. The week before I went into
lockdown the tube was heaving.

1634
00:53:52.336 --> 00:53:53.961
lockdown the tube was heaving.
People are coughing and spluttering

1635
00:53:53.961 --> 00:53:55.336
People are coughing and splutbering
and sniffing,

1636
00:53:55.336 --> 00:53:56.961
People are coughing and spluttering
and sniffing, it was terrible. I do

1637
00:53:56.961 --> 00:53:57.461
and sniffing, it was terrible. I do
know peopla

1638
00:53:57.461 --> 00:53:58.878
and sniffing, it was terrible. I do
know people who continued to travel

1639
00:53:58.878 --> 00:53:59.336
know peopla who continued to travel
around

1640
00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:01.253
know people who continued to travel
around London who got the virus. I

1641
00:54:01.253 --> 00:54:01.669
around London who got the vims. I
did not

1642
00:54:01.669 --> 00:54:01.961
around London who got the virus. I
did not take

1643
00:54:01.961 --> 00:54:02.169
around London who got the vims. I
did not take my

1644
00:54:02.169 --> 00:54:02.711
around London who got the virus. I
did not take my leadership from this

1645
00:54:02.711 --> 00:54:06.461
did not take my leadership from this
government. We know about Boris and

1646
00:54:06.461 --> 00:54:08.711
government. We know about Boris and
him shaking hands with coronavirus

1647
00:54:08.711 --> 00:54:09.044
him shaking hands with coronavims
patients in

1648
00:54:09.044 --> 00:54:09.961
him shaking hands with coronavirus
patients in hospital when we all

1649
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:11.336
patients in hospital when we all
knew you should not be making

1650
00:54:11.336 --> 00:54:14.544
knew you should not be making
physical contact with people. He did

1651
00:54:14.544 --> 00:54:14.919
physical contact with peopla. He did
later say

1652
00:54:14.919 --> 00:54:15.961
physical contact with people. He did
later say he was shaking hands with

1653
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:20.128
later say he was shaking hands with
the staff. Well, that is what he

1654
00:54:20.128 --> 00:54:22.961
the staff. Well, that is what he
said, that is what we perceived him

1655
00:54:22.961 --> 00:54:26.169
said, that is what we perceived him
to say. So that was his leadership.

1656
00:54:26.169 --> 00:54:26.711
to say. So that was his leadership.
I think peopla

1657
00:54:26.711 --> 00:54:30.794
to say. So that was his leadership.
I think people are very suspicious.

1658
00:54:30.794 --> 00:54:31.378
I think peopla are very suspicious.
I think peopla

1659
00:54:31.378 --> 00:54:32.169
I think people are very suspicious.
I think people are making up their

1660
00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:32.336
I think peopla are making up their
own

1661
00:54:32.336 --> 00:54:33.586
I think people are making up their
own minds about what they are going

1662
00:54:33.586 --> 00:54:35.919
own minds about what they are going
to do and not listening to the

1663
00:54:35.919 --> 00:54:37.753
to do and not listening to the
government. We have to bring up

1664
00:54:37.753 --> 00:54:39.253
government. We have to bring up
Dominic Cummings, who I am sure is

1665
00:54:39.253 --> 00:54:41.461
Dominic Cummings, who I am sure is
brought up a lot in this

1666
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:43.669
brought up a lot in this
programme... He certainly was at the

1667
00:54:43.669 --> 00:54:45.836
programme... He certainly was at the
time. Look at his leadership skills,

1668
00:54:45.836 --> 00:54:48.878
time. Look at his leadership skills,
although he is the man behind the

1669
00:54:48.878 --> 00:54:50.169
although he is the man behind the
throne, the puppet master, but we

1670
00:54:50.169 --> 00:54:53.711
throne, the puppet master, but we
know what he did. It is a very

1671
00:54:53.711 --> 00:54:55.586
know what he did. It is a very
difficult situation, it is difficult

1672
00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:55.919
difficult situation, it is difficult
for peopla.

1673
00:54:55.919 --> 00:54:59.669
difficult situation, it is difficult
for people. Who do you listen to?

1674
00:54:59.669 --> 00:55:00.544
for peopla. who do you listen to?
Testing is

1675
00:55:00.544 --> 00:55:00.586
for people. who do you listen to?
Testing is one

1676
00:55:00.586 --> 00:55:01.544
for people. Who do you listen to?
Testing is one thing, tracking is

1677
00:55:01.544 --> 00:55:03.294
Testing is one thing, tracking is
another, but it is the speed of

1678
00:55:03.294 --> 00:55:04.586
another, but it is the speed of
result of the test which is

1679
00:55:04.586 --> 00:55:09.294
result of the test which is
important. I was desperate to get

1680
00:55:09.294 --> 00:55:12.586
important. I was desperate to get
back to work when I was tested, but

1681
00:55:12.586 --> 00:55:14.753
back to work when I was tested, but
it took three days for my results to

1682
00:55:14.753 --> 00:55:16.753
it took three days for my results to
come back. I was desperate because I

1683
00:55:16.753 --> 00:55:20.169
come back. I was desperate because I
knew I was needed in work. But when

1684
00:55:20.169 --> 00:55:23.961
knew I was needed in work. But when
you hear stories like getting your

1685
00:55:23.961 --> 00:55:25.544
you hear stories like getting your
eyes tested by driving a certain

1686
00:55:25.544 --> 00:55:31.586
eyes tested by driving a certain
amount of miles, and the lack of

1687
00:55:31.586 --> 00:55:33.961
amount of miles, and the lack of
leadership. We are fortunate to have

1688
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:36.544
leadership. We are fortunate to have
Vaughan Gething here. Yes, the

1689
00:55:36.544 --> 00:55:38.628
Vaughan Gething here. Yes, the
majority of people might get their

1690
00:55:38.628 --> 00:55:41.294
majority of people might get their
results, but I think for health care

1691
00:55:41.294 --> 00:55:41.586
results, but I think for health rare
workers

1692
00:55:41.586 --> 00:55:43.128
results, but I think for health care
workers the speed of reporting

1693
00:55:43.128 --> 00:55:44.961
workers the speed of reporting
should be quicker. Not only that,

1694
00:55:44.961 --> 00:55:47.378
should be quicker. Not only that,
the results and the statistics we

1695
00:55:47.378 --> 00:55:47.711
the results and the statistis we
look for,

1696
00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.794
the results and the statistics we
look for, we need to have those

1697
00:55:49.794 --> 00:55:52.919
look for, we need to have those
results quicker, we need to learn

1698
00:55:52.919 --> 00:55:54.794
results quicker, we need to learn
from Korea where the results come

1699
00:55:54.794 --> 00:55:59.294
from Korea where the results come
within a day. Then the track and

1700
00:55:59.294 --> 00:56:01.503
within a day. Then the track and
testing process is much faster with

1701
00:56:01.503 --> 00:56:03.669
testing process is much faster with
isolation, so we needed to learn

1702
00:56:03.669 --> 00:56:05.294
isolation, so we needed to learn
much quicker from

1703
00:56:05.294 --> 00:56:05.878
isolation, so we needed to learn
much quickerfrom Korea and other

1704
00:56:05.878 --> 00:56:06.253
much quicker from Korea and other
countries

1705
00:56:06.253 --> 00:56:07.378
much quickerfrom Korea and other
countries that have dealt with it,

1706
00:56:07.378 --> 00:56:09.003
countries that have dealt with it,
rather than wait for a lack of

1707
00:56:09.003 --> 00:56:14.003
rather than wait for a lack of
leadership.

1708
00:56:14.711 --> 00:56:15.128
leadership. I am

1709
00:56:15.128 --> 00:56:15.294
leadership. lam not

1710
00:56:15.294 --> 00:56:18.753
leadership. I am not condemning what
the Prime Minister was ‘s aided, or

1711
00:56:18.753 --> 00:56:20.044
the Prime Minister was ‘s aided, or
the other ingredients within the

1712
00:56:20.044 --> 00:56:22.919
the other ingredients within the
whole recipe of protecting people. I

1713
00:56:22.919 --> 00:56:24.544
whole recipe of protecting people. I
feel much safer with this to me to

1714
00:56:24.544 --> 00:56:24.961
feel much safer with this to me to
mla over

1715
00:56:24.961 --> 00:56:28.794
feel much safer with this to me to
rule over here, but then the lack of

1716
00:56:28.794 --> 00:56:29.586
mle over here, but then the lack of
PPE, and we

1717
00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:30.294
rule over here, but then the lack of
PPE, and we are hearing stories and

1718
00:56:30.294 --> 00:56:33.169
PPE, and we are hearing stories and
the report coming out about ethnic

1719
00:56:33.169 --> 00:56:35.336
the report coming out about ethnic
minority doctors, why they are dying

1720
00:56:35.336 --> 00:56:37.961
minority doctors, why they are dying
more than others. These are issues

1721
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.169
more than others. These are issues
we need to have clear

1722
00:56:39.169 --> 00:56:41.253
we need to have clear
recommendations to make sure we are

1723
00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:42.711
recommendations to make sure we are
moving in the right direction. We

1724
00:56:42.711 --> 00:56:44.169
moving in the right direction. We
need to protect each and every life

1725
00:56:44.169 --> 00:56:46.711
need to protect each and every life
that we can. Not

1726
00:56:46.711 --> 00:56:48.169
need to protect each and every life
that we can. Notjust doctors, all

1727
00:56:48.169 --> 00:56:48.378
that we ran. Not just doctors, all
health

1728
00:56:48.378 --> 00:56:51.544
that we can. Notjust doctors, all
health care staff. Rocco. It is very

1729
00:56:51.544 --> 00:56:54.253
health rare staff. Rocco. It is very
peculiar this

1730
00:56:54.253 --> 00:56:55.086
health care staff. Rocco. It is very
peculiar this virus and that it

1731
00:56:55.086 --> 00:56:56.336
peculiar this virus and that it
doesn’t affect everybody in the same

1732
00:56:56.336 --> 00:57:03.044
doesn’t affect everybody in the same
way. The week before I worked cheek

1733
00:57:03.044 --> 00:57:05.836
way. The week before I worked cheek
by

1734
00:57:05.836 --> 00:57:06.128
way. The week before I worked cheek
byjowt

1735
00:57:06.128 --> 00:57:06.503
way. The week before I worked cheek
by jowl with six

1736
00:57:06.503 --> 00:57:06.919
way. The week before I worked cheek
byjowl with six senior executives

1737
00:57:06.919 --> 00:57:11.919
byjowl with six senior executives
in my office because we were

1738
00:57:11.919 --> 00:57:13.336
in my office because we were
planning for the issues that we had

1739
00:57:13.336 --> 00:57:15.628
planning for the issues that we had
to face. None of them got the

1740
00:57:15.628 --> 00:57:19.961
to face. None of them got the
disease. In my household which has

1741
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:21.669
disease. In my household which has
11 people and two children and we

1742
00:57:21.669 --> 00:57:22.294
11 peopla and two children and we
are all

1743
00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:23.294
11 people and two children and we
are all together in it, only four

1744
00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:23.753
are all together in it, only four
peopla got

1745
00:57:23.753 --> 00:57:26.294
are all together in it, only four
people got the disease. Why didn’t

1746
00:57:26.294 --> 00:57:26.544
people got the disease. why didn’t
the

1747
00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:31.961
people got the disease. Why didn’t
the others catch it?

1748
00:57:34.753 --> 00:57:37.586
the others catch it? I think a lot
of the modelling that is taking

1749
00:57:37.586 --> 00:57:39.961
of the modelling that is taking
place is based on assumptions that

1750
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:44.378
place is based on assumptions that
are completely wrong. It is a new

1751
00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:49.961
are completely wrong. It is a new
disease, of course. I know, yes, but

1752
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:52.336
disease, of course. I know, yes, but
500,000 deaths are based on a

1753
00:57:52.336 --> 00:57:54.294
500,000 deaths are based on a
computer model and false

1754
00:57:54.294 --> 00:57:56.753
computer model and false
assumptions. I am

1755
00:57:56.753 --> 00:57:56.919
computer model and false
assumptions. lam not

1756
00:57:56.919 --> 00:57:57.378
computer model and false
assumptions. I am not sure that

1757
00:57:57.378 --> 00:58:02.294
assumptions. I am not sure that
Niall Ferguson shares that view. I

1758
00:58:02.294 --> 00:58:03.669
Niall Ferguson shares that view. I
am not sure the same would have

1759
00:58:03.669 --> 00:58:05.753
am not sure the same would have
happened if we had locked down

1760
00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:06.128
happened if we had locked down
eartier

1761
00:58:06.128 --> 00:58:07.044
happened if we had locked down
earlier if the same assumptions were

1762
00:58:07.044 --> 00:58:07.669
eartier if the same assumptions were
put into the

1763
00:58:07.669 --> 00:58:09.961
earlier if the same assumptions were
put into the model. This illness has

1764
00:58:09.961 --> 00:58:12.294
put into the model. This illness has
not been known to science for more

1765
00:58:12.294 --> 00:58:14.128
not been known to science for more
than six months. We cannot say for

1766
00:58:14.128 --> 00:58:16.628
than six months. We cannot say for
certain how it will pan out. We are

1767
00:58:16.628 --> 00:58:21.836
certain how it will pan out. We are
making the best assessments. This

1768
00:58:21.836 --> 00:58:23.211
making the best assessments. This
whole two metre distance is based

1769
00:58:23.211 --> 00:58:26.211
whole two metre distance is based
principally on the Spanish flu, the

1770
00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:26.753
principally on the Spanish ﬂu, the
second

1771
00:58:26.753 --> 00:58:28.628
principally on the Spanish flu, the
second wave is based on the Spanish

1772
00:58:28.628 --> 00:58:28.711
second wave is based on the Spanish
ﬂu.

1773
00:58:28.711 --> 00:58:29.003
second wave is based on the Spanish
ﬂu, a

1774
00:58:29.003 --> 00:58:30.586
second wave is based on the Spanish
flu, a completely different disease

1775
00:58:30.586 --> 00:58:31.294
ﬂu, a completely different disease
to this.

1776
00:58:31.294 --> 00:58:32.919
flu, a completely different disease
to this. The last two coronavirus is

1777
00:58:32.919 --> 00:58:34.378
to this. The last two coronavirus is
petered out on their own and that

1778
00:58:34.378 --> 00:58:36.169
petered out on their own and that
would happen with this one. That

1779
00:58:36.169 --> 00:58:38.628
would happen with this one. That
would be marvellous if that were the

1780
00:58:38.628 --> 00:58:39.044
would be marvellous if that were the
use. I

1781
00:58:39.044 --> 00:58:39.294
would be marvellous if that were the
use. lam

1782
00:58:39.294 --> 00:58:40.294
would be marvellous if that were the
case. I am not sure if there is

1783
00:58:40.294 --> 00:58:41.586
use. I am not sure if there is
certainty on

1784
00:58:41.586 --> 00:58:42.586
case. I am not sure if there is
certainty on that, but thank you. We

1785
00:58:42.586 --> 00:58:46.253
certainty on that, but thank you. We
are out of time. Our hour is up.

1786
00:58:50.753 --> 00:58:56.919
Our audience tonight came from
Cardiff. We are doing a special

1787
00:58:56.919 --> 00:58:58.919
Cardiff. We are doing a special
programme for the under 305 and no

1788
00:58:58.919 --> 00:59:00.586
programme for the under 305 and no
doubt they will have a lot of

1789
00:59:00.586 --> 00:59:00.794
programme for the under 30s and no
doubt they will have a lot of issues

1790
00:59:00.794 --> 00:59:03.836
doubt they will have a lot of issues
that affect their lives, the

1791
00:59:03.836 --> 00:59:05.628
that affect their lives, the
economy, jobs, housing, and the

1792
00:59:05.628 --> 00:59:07.544
economy, jobs, housing, and the
effects of coronavirus which will

1793
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:09.003
effects of coronavirus which will
affect their features and everyone

1794
00:59:09.003 --> 00:59:10.128
affect their features and everyone
else’s.

1795
00:59:10.128 --> 00:59:12.086

watching Question Time. -- down the
line.

1817
01:00:13.503 --> 01:00:17.003
The people who took ill
are Sergei and Yulia Skripal.

1818
01:00:17.003 --> 01:00:19.336
Sergei was an MI6 agent.

1819
01:00:19.336 --> 01:00:20.711
What do we think it is?

1820
01:00:20.711 --> 01:00:21.878
We don’t know yet.

1821
01:00:21.878 --> 01:00:24.836
Novichok. A spoonful
could kill thousands.

1822
01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:28.211
Do not go in that house.
Repeat, do not go in that house.

1823
01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:30.836
Ourjob is not
to find out who did it

1824
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:33.836
but to keep the people
of Salisbury safe.

1825
01:00:33.836 --> 01:00:35.336
What happened 7

1826
01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:37.836
Is he going to be OK?

1827
01:00:37.836 --> 01:00:41.003
I don’t know. We don’t know the
source of contamination or have an

1828
01:00:41.003 --> 01:00:42.586
established chain of events.

1829
01:00:42.586 --> 01:00:45.253
All we do know is that
for the people in Salisbury, we are

1830
01:00:45.253 --> 01:00:46.753
their only line of defence.

1831
01:00:46.753 --> 01:00:49.461
The Salisbury Poisonings,
across three nights:

1832
01:00:54.586 --> 01:00:56.044
Even a bad time at Glastonbury’s

1833
01:00:56.044 --> 01:00:57.878
better than a good time
anywhere else.

1834
01:00:57.878 --> 01:01:00.669
Seeing Glastonbury for
the first time’s mind—blowing.

1835
01:01:02.044 --> 01:01:05.169
The closing set at Block9, 2015.

1836
01:01:06.211 --> 01:01:08.669
I wish you could bottle that up
and take it away with you.

1837
01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:12.419
The sun’s shining and you’re
rocking it up here on the stage.

1838
01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.419
There’s no better feeling
in the world.

1839
01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:18.211
Let’s make it
a Glastonbury to remember.

1840
01:01:18.211 --> 01:01:21.628
Relive the best of the festival
on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.

1841
01:01:22.753 --> 01:01:24.586
So, I’ve had an idea to save summer.

1842
01:01:24.586 --> 01:01:26.919
Introducing Cardboard Crouch.

1843
01:01:26.919 --> 01:01:29.253
Now I can be your
kickabout companion,

1844
01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:30.753
your mate with all the moves...

1845
01:01:32.003 --> 01:01:33.378
..your captive audience...

1846
01:01:33.378 --> 01:01:34.919
They actually get olives.

1847
01:01:34.919 --> 01:01:36.628
CROW CAWS

1848
01:01:36.628 --> 01:01:38.128
Tough Crouch.

1849
01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.461
..and much more.

1850
01:01:40.711 --> 01:01:42.461
Yeah, the BBC didn’t go for that.

1851
01:01:42.461 --> 01:01:43.836
So, we have come up
with a new show —

1852
01:01:43.836 --> 01:01:46.003
myself, Maya Jame,
Alex and his band,

1853
01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:47.753
packed full of music,
comedy and sport.

1854
01:01:47.753 --> 01:01:48.794
Hope you canjoin us.

1855
01:02:08.378 --> 01:02:11.794
From Monday, in England,
people will be able to get some

1856
01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.628
much—needed retail therapy,
because nonessential shops

1857
01:02:14.628 --> 01:02:17.753
are going to open as part
of the unlocking and no one needs

1858
01:02:17.753 --> 01:02:20.419
retail therapy more
than Chris Mason.

1859
01:02:20.419 --> 01:02:22.128
I know, I know.

1860
01:02:22.128 --> 01:02:25.003
Not being able to go to clothes
shops for three months?

1861
01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:25.794
My goodness me.

1862
01:02:25.794 --> 01:02:27.253
It’s been a dream for you!

1863
01:02:27.253 --> 01:02:29.169
It has been a struggle,
it really has.

1864
01:02:29.169 --> 01:02:31.794
This is going to turn
into a nightmare, because we have

1865
01:02:31.794 --> 01:02:33.961
hired a celebrity stylist to give
you some tips.

1866
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:34.961
It is Gok Wan!

1867
01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.003
Hello.

1868
01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:37.086
Hi!

1869
01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.128
Hi, Chris.

1870
01:02:38.128 --> 01:02:39.169
I brought my comb.

1871
01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:40.169
Are you all right?

1872
01:02:40.169 --> 01:02:41.211
I’m all right.

1873
01:02:41.211 --> 01:02:42.294
Battling on.

1874
01:02:42.294 --> 01:02:43.669
Because you sound a bit nervous.

1875
01:02:43.669 --> 01:02:44.919
I have to be honest.

1876
01:02:44.919 --> 01:02:45.961
Are you nervous?

1877
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:47.169
I am, I am petrified.

1878
01:02:47.169 --> 01:02:48.211
I really am.

1879
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:50.378
I’m a little less than
a slave to fashion.

1880
01:02:50.378 --> 01:02:51.419
So, yeah.

1881
01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:54.294
I kind of disagree, actually,
because I am looking at two pictures

1882
01:02:54.294 --> 01:02:57.836
of you Chris right now and I have
to say, there is definitely a hard

1883
01:02:57.836 --> 01:03:02.044
and fast style stamp going on there.

1884
01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.461
0K.

1885
01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:05.378
We’re going to talk
about the first one,

1886
01:03:05.378 --> 01:03:07.003
with you with your flecked jumper.

1887
01:03:07.003 --> 01:03:08.503
Oh, yeah?

1888
01:03:08.503 --> 01:03:10.128
You know, with a full on collar.

1889
01:03:10.128 --> 01:03:13.294
And I am liking the fact that
you have got a little bit

1890
01:03:13.294 --> 01:03:14.336
of gingham poking through.

1891
01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:16.669
A bit of personality,
3 bit of colour, poking through.

1892
01:03:16.669 --> 01:03:19.378
I like the fact that
you are also owning the jumper,

1893
01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:22.253
you have got your arm up
on the side, you are smiling

1894
01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:23.294
directly at the camera.

1895
01:03:23.294 --> 01:03:25.919
You are owning the fleck,
every single fleck in that sweater,

1896
01:03:25.919 --> 01:03:29.211
so congratulations.

1897
01:03:29.211 --> 01:03:30.753
I love that.

1898
01:03:30.753 --> 01:03:31.794
Owning the fleck.

1899
01:03:31.794 --> 01:03:34.419
My Twitter bio is
changing by the second!

1900
01:03:34.419 --> 01:03:37.086
Can Ijust check, to reassure
viewers who might be feeling

1901
01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:39.503
a bit nervous about this,
that this is not suddenly

1902
01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:42.378
going to turn into an episode
of How To Look Good Naked?

1903
01:03:42.378 --> 01:03:44.086
Which was always the grand finale.

1904
01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:46.628
0K.

1905
01:03:46.628 --> 01:03:51.628
It is not How To Look Good Naked,
it is something else.

1906
01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:53.753
And just to sign off
on the second photo,

1907
01:03:53.753 --> 01:03:56.044
Chris, I like the hat,
I like the colour,

1908
01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:58.419
I like the texture,
I like the surprised expression

1909
01:03:58.419 --> 01:04:00.836
that is happening to you.

1910
01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.836
I am loving all of it.

1911
01:04:02.836 --> 01:04:03.961
Wow!

1912
01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:07.461
And we hope you love everything else
we are going to talk about on this

1913
01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:10.753
edition of the Coronavirus Newscast.

1914
01:04:10.753 --> 01:04:12.378
The Coronavirus Newscast
from the BBC.

1915
01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:19.836
Hello, it’s Adam in the studio.

1916
01:04:19.836 --> 01:04:23.253
And Laura in the studio,
two metres apart.

1917
01:04:23.253 --> 01:04:27.211
And Chris in his exclusive
fashion booth of news.

1918
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:29.378
And Fergus in another studio
in New Broadcasting House.

1919
01:04:29.378 --> 01:04:32.169
Right, so Gok Wan has thoroughly
tested Chris Mason’s fashion style.

1920
01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:35.253
I don’t know if it was a positive
or negative result, everyone else

1921
01:04:35.253 --> 01:04:37.461
can be the judge of that.

1922
01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:39.836
But the nation is now being,
at least in England,

1923
01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:42.253
tested and traced to some extent
by the new testing

1924
01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.419
and tracing system.

1925
01:04:44.419 --> 01:04:47.753
Fergus, I’m going to do a big
old chat with you about the numbers

1926
01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:51.128
in a second, because it is worth
just looking at them in some detail,

1927
01:04:51.128 --> 01:04:54.044
but Laura, do they seem pleased
with how the first few weeks

1928
01:04:54.044 --> 01:04:55.253
of this have gone?

1929
01:04:55.253 --> 01:04:58.336
So, inside government,
I think there is a degree of relief,

1930
01:04:58.336 --> 01:05:03.294
because it has actually happened,
it does actually exist.

1931
01:05:03.836 --> 01:05:07.128
There is a sense that it has gone
a bit better than they thought,

1932
01:05:07.128 --> 01:05:09.753
in terms of the numbers initially,
but also a real acceptance

1933
01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:12.878
that it is not where it needs to be,
not by any stretch.

1934
01:05:12.878 --> 01:05:15.753
And the app, that a few weeks
ago was meant to kind
