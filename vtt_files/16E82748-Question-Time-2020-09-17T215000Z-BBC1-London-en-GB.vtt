Good evening and welcome
to my guests here in

the studio and to Nicci

27
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.496
who joins us down the line
from Suffolk and to the virtual

28
00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:52.912
audience, thank you very much
for being part of this

29
00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.579
and you are from the Oldham area.

30
00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.121
Very good to have you with us
and of course, if you want to join

31
00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:01.037
in the conversation at home,
you can follow us in the usual

32
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.037
way on social media.

33
00:02:02.037 --> 00:02:04.454
So, let us get started,
it is ourfirst programme

34
00:02:04.454 --> 00:02:07.912
after the summer, we are keen
to get going.

35
00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:09.912
Our first question tonight
is from Niall Bowman.

36
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:13.121
Hello, it has been reported
that there are no coronavirus tests

37
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:15.829
available in the top ten
hotspots in England.

38
00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.912
Is this the world—beating
test operation that

39
00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:20.829
Boris Johnson promised?

40
00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.704
Jon Ashworth.

41
00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:26.537
Well, great question
and quite obviously, no,

42
00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:29.704
it is not the world beating testing
and tracing system that we were

43
00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:32.412
promised by the Prime Minister.

44
00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:37.412
Look, testing has become
a complete shambles.

45
00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:40.704
We are in a real mess
and we always warned them,

46
00:02:40.704 --> 00:02:42.954
the Labour Party warned them,
plenty of public health

47
00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:47.996
experts warned them,
that unless they fix testing and put

48
00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:51.829
in place a system of tracing,
which is where, if you

49
00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.454
have been in touch

50
00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:58.412
with somebody who has got the virus,
that you are contacted

51
00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:02.204
and you are asked to isolate
yourselves, unless you are putting

52
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:05.079
on a proper effective system,
the virus will get out of control.

53
00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.704
And they did not put in place
an effective system.

54
00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:11.204
The contact tracing element
of test entrees is not

55
00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:14.704
contacting enough people,
so in Oldham, for example,

56
00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:18.371
the call centre that is doing this,
which has been given to Serco,

57
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.287
a company that did not have any
experience of doing this sort

58
00:03:21.287 --> 00:03:25.621
of work, only contacted around 50%
of people and what happens is,

59
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:28.954
even if people are contacted
and asked to isolate,

60
00:03:28.954 --> 00:03:32.412
that means taking two weeks
off work potentially,

61
00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:37.412
and if you are on a zero—hours
contract and low pay

62
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:41.246
unscrupulous employer,
you cannot always take two

63
00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:42.871
weeks off work.

64
00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:47.871
By not fixing testing and not fixing
this tracing element of it,

65
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.121
you allow the infections to rise
and what we are now seeing is,

66
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:53.287
I believe, the virus potentially
getting out of control

67
00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:58.329
and when you lose control
of testing and tracing,

68
00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.996
you do not know where the virus
is and you cannot track it.

69
00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:07.996
So if we end up having
further restrictions,

70
00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:12.079
already serious restrictions have
been announced, the rule of six,

71
00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.496
in Oldham you have got restrictions,
if we end up having even more severe

72
00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:17.871
restrictions in the coming months,
and the second dangerous spike

73
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:21.246
in the virus, it is because of this
failure to deal and get testing

74
00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:24.079
and tracing fixed and ministers
should have got in place the extra

75
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.121
testing we needed now.

76
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.329
Everyone said to them,
as go back, as people

77
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.204
are encouraged to go back to work,
as we move into autumn,

78
00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.371
whenever there are colds
and snifﬂes and so on,

79
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:35.496
that they would be more pressure
on the system and ministers did not

80
00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:38.579
increase testing to the levels that
were needed, so it is not well

81
00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.496
beaten, it is a shambles and,
you know, the British people have

82
00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:42.662
made great sacrifices
throughout this.

83
00:04:42.662 --> 00:04:45.579
People have not seen their families,
they have not gone to weddings,

84
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.454
they have not even said goodbye
to their loved ones at funerals.

85
00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.829
The British people have
honoured their side of the bargain,

86
00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:51.912
the government haven’t.

87
00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:54.787
They were supposed to fix testing
for this winter and I am

88
00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:55.829
afraid they have failed.

89
00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.621
John Caudwell.

90
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:02.037
Well, I think they probably have
failed to give a world—class system,

91
00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:05.621
but I think that somewhat misses
the point altogether,

92
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.996
because, first of all,
I am not a great believer

93
00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:09.704
in testing and tracing.

94
00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:10.996
Why not?

95
00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:15.996
Purely and simply because the virus
takes a while to develop...

96
00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:22.746
To form a positive test. 50

97
00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:24.829
To form a positive test. So you’re
going to be getting negative test

98
00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:27.454
going to be getting negative test
from people who are infected.

99
00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:29.829
By the time you’ve got
a positive test from those

100
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.787
people who are infected,
they have already infected

101
00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:33.912
lots of other people,
without knowing that they have

102
00:05:33.912 --> 00:05:34.996
got the virus.

103
00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:36.621
Even that is not the central point.

104
00:05:36.621 --> 00:05:41.662
The central point is that this virus
was deadly, really deadly in April.

105
00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:45.871
It was killing around
about 18% of people.

106
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:50.162
If you look at the percentage
of deaths now, there is only .4%

107
00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:54.246
of deaths and of course each one
of those is tragic, but it is .4%

108
00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:58.121
of deaths instead of 18%
and it is the same worldwide.

109
00:05:58.121 --> 00:06:03.162
It is the same in Spain,
it is the same in France.

110
00:06:14.954 --> 00:06:18.037
What that leads you to say is not
worry about test and trace,

111
00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:20.662
let us worry about why has this
virus lost its potency?

112
00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:23.787
But how do you know it is not
going to get worse again?

113
00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:26.871
How do you know that there will not
be any more deaths again,

114
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:28.537
as we are seen in other countries?

115
00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:31.371
My point is, that there are six
potential reasons why this virus

116
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:32.454
is not killing people.

117
00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:33.496
We can list them.

118
00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:34.537
Briefly.

119
00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:37.912
One is that young people are getting
tested and that is putting a huge

120
00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:39.579
amount of extra positives
of asymptomatic young

121
00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.996
people who are not going
to fall ill from it.

122
00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:44.621
The second point is that
a lot of the people that

123
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:45.829
were vulnerable have already died.

124
00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:48.704
The rest of the vulnerable people
have been well shielded and well

125
00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:52.246
looked after by society and then
there is the possibility

126
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:57.246
that the masks that we are wearing
and the distancing that we are doing

127
00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:02.121
is reducing viral loads
and it is not proven,

128
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:05.996
but the possibility of a reduced
viral load might mean a reduced

129
00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:10.996
illness that the body and the immune
system could cope with and fight

130
00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:13.371
of whereas an increased load won’t.

131
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:15.287
Would you get rid of
testing altogether?

132
00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:18.246
No, but let me finish the point,
because the most important point

133
00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:20.662
of all is coming up,
which is, has the virus

134
00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:23.746
actually lost its potency?

135
00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:26.662
Now, what I think we should be
doing, the scientists

136
00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:31.704
and the government should be finding
out the waiting between these six

137
00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:36.121
factors, and if it is number six,
which is the virus is losing

138
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:38.912
its potency, we don’t
really need to worry,

139
00:07:38.912 --> 00:07:42.871
because the deaths will be less
than they were with common flu.

140
00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:44.954
So, we need to understand that.

141
00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:46.537
Would I scrap testing?

142
00:07:46.537 --> 00:07:50.162
No, I wouldn’t, because it has
a place to play in this,

143
00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:52.662
but it is not the be
all and end all.

144
00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:55.079
The be all and end all
is understanding this virus,

145
00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:59.037
understanding the six factors
and then planning the action

146
00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:01.912
according to what we find.

147
00:08:01.912 --> 00:08:05.121
Nicci, I saw you shaking your
head at some of that.

148
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:09.371
I can’t remember which bits
I was shaking my head at.

149
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:13.621
I was just going to say, first
of all, in reply to the question,

150
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:15.746
that I quite often feel
that we are living

151
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:19.079
through Groundhog Day.

152
00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:22.037
This has been going on for over six
months and every week

153
00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:27.079
or so we are told that testing
is just around the corner.

154
00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:30.746
We are told that there is this kind
of superb system coming our way,

155
00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:33.621
but it is another few weeks
and another few weeks and it

156
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:38.246
has been six months.

157
00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:43.204
What is more, the hyperbolic
language that is used about testing,

158
00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:49.412
the £100 billion spent
on a moonshot, using a technique

159
00:08:49.412 --> 00:08:51.787
which as far as I know
doesn’t actually exist yet.

160
00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:56.079
It feels like a kind
of flummery and a way ofjust

161
00:08:56.079 --> 00:09:00.829
grandstanding and speaking,
as if speaking something will make

162
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:03.912
it true and I think most
of the public have ceased believing

163
00:09:03.912 --> 00:09:06.746
it true and I think most
of the public have ceased believing

164
00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:11.787
these promises and then there
is the first of what is happening

165
00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:17.871
these promises and then there
is the farce of what is happening

166
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.246
with testing, where most tests
you cannot get four days.

167
00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:22.912
There is a great backlog,
there are teachers not been able

168
00:09:22.912 --> 00:09:25.787
to teach, there are doctors not
being able to go into hospital,

169
00:09:25.787 --> 00:09:28.204
there are carers being kept away
from the care homes,

170
00:09:28.204 --> 00:09:30.871
most tests, once they have been
done, they do not come

171
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.037
back in under 2A hours.

172
00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:37.079
People are being sent from Oxford
to Aberystwyth or Inverness.

173
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:43.121
People are being sent to test
centres that don’t actually exist

174
00:09:45.746 --> 00:09:48.912
and it feels quite like a farce
to me and it also feels

175
00:09:48.912 --> 00:09:51.996
that it is a farce that is just
eroding trust in any kind

176
00:09:51.996 --> 00:09:54.954
of competence in this government
and in the meantime,

177
00:09:54.954 --> 00:09:59.996
people are being kept separate
from each other.

178
00:10:01.537 --> 00:10:05.537
I mean, I work for a campaigning
group that once family members to go

179
00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:10.496
back into care homes,
because for six months families have

180
00:10:10.746 --> 00:10:15.787
been kept apart in great anguish
and suffering and damage

181
00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:27.621
and the care homes are waiting
for tests, which they are being

182
00:10:28.037 --> 00:10:29.246
promised and not being given.

183
00:10:29.246 --> 00:10:31.412
Let’s hearfrom some
of our audience, you have

184
00:10:31.412 --> 00:10:32.579
got your hands up, Ian.

185
00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:34.287
Yeah.

186
00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:37.204
It is more to do with the government
contracts awarded to companies

187
00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:39.621
appointed without tenders,
using Covid as an excuse to award

188
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:41.537
them, it seemed a bit of a rush.

189
00:10:41.537 --> 00:10:45.996
These companies are being paid
millions and they have been seen not

190
00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:49.412
to work much before,
so Ijust think it is going

191
00:10:49.412 --> 00:10:50.621
back further to that.

192
00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:54.829
It is the awarding of
the contracts to these

193
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:58.537
companies who don’t seem to,
you know, coordinate everything.

194
00:10:58.537 --> 00:11:01.912
0K, Katie.

195
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.371
Yeah, I agree with Nicci.

196
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:06.287
It is a farce.

197
00:11:06.287 --> 00:11:10.371
And what made me furious today
was whenJacob Rees—Mogg talked

198
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:15.329
about people carping
about the testing system.

199
00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:20.496
We are not carping here in Oldham
and people on this panel

200
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:25.204
who are from Oldham,
one of the highest, which has one

201
00:11:25.204 --> 00:11:28.871
of the highest rates in the country,
I tell you why we need those tests,

202
00:11:28.871 --> 00:11:31.704
you know, we need them for our
elderly relatives who are ill,

203
00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:33.121
because we are worrying about them.

204
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.787
We need them for our children,
so they can get back

205
00:11:35.787 --> 00:11:36.871
to their education.

206
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:40.162
We need them for ourselves
so that we can get back to our work,

207
00:11:40.162 --> 00:11:42.621
to ourjobs and earn a living.

208
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:47.662
Jacob Rees—Mogg just made me sick
today with pushing the blame

209
00:11:48.287 --> 00:11:51.579
back on to those of us
who are vulnerable.

210
00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:56.537
We need those tests to be able
to get on with our lives.

211
00:11:57.079 --> 00:11:59.662
Nadeem, Jacob Rees—Mogg
saying that people should

212
00:11:59.662 --> 00:12:04.662
stop endlessly carping,
were you happy with his comments?

213
00:12:08.537 --> 00:12:11.454
Well, let me try and
address the question?

214
00:12:11.454 --> 00:12:14.121
Just quickly, because I do want
you to get onto that,

215
00:12:14.121 --> 00:12:15.787
but given that Katie
just mentioned that.

216
00:12:15.787 --> 00:12:16.829
No, of course not.

217
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:18.246
Was he wrong to say that?

218
00:12:18.246 --> 00:12:20.412
So, let me try and address
the question, Fiona.

219
00:12:20.412 --> 00:12:23.037
Nial, you are right to say
and to challenge on this,

220
00:12:23.037 --> 00:12:24.496
because it is difficult
and challenging.

221
00:12:24.496 --> 00:12:27.329
You know, when we got into this
pandemic, we could only do

222
00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.787
about 2000 tests a day
and we are now doing

223
00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:34.746
240,000 tests a day,
but clearly there is more demand.

224
00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:38.662
You’re not testing
240,000 people a day.

225
00:12:38.662 --> 00:12:42.246
240,000 tests a day at the moment.

226
00:12:42.246 --> 00:12:47.204
We plan to increase it to 500,000
by the end of October.

227
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.787
There are 250,000 antigen tests
today, but you are right

228
00:12:53.787 --> 00:12:55.704
to challenge us now,
because we have got

229
00:12:55.704 --> 00:12:56.912
to do even better.

230
00:12:56.912 --> 00:12:59.496
Now, some things have got better,
for example, the average distance

231
00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:03.079
someone has to travel for a test has
come down from 6.4 miles to 5.4

232
00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:06.079
miles, but the in—person test,
where the results are then delivered

233
00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:11.079
within 2A hours has also come down
to 64% today with the data.

234
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:16.912
I am not sitting here trying to hide
away from the challenges,

235
00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:20.246
we have got to do even better.

236
00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:25.287
Can Ijust pick you up
on that 240,000?

237
00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:32.329
The government’s own figures,
the latest figures are that 81,000

238
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:33.787
people are being tested every day.

239
00:13:33.787 --> 00:13:35.204
That is the government’s
latest figures.

240
00:13:35.204 --> 00:13:36.246
Not 240,000, 81,000.

241
00:13:36.246 --> 00:13:37.954
The figures I have here with me...

242
00:13:37.954 --> 00:13:40.287
That is the capacity,
81,000 according to the latest

243
00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:42.246
figures from the government
on the 9th of September,

244
00:13:42.246 --> 00:13:43.287
81,000 a day.

245
00:13:43.287 --> 00:13:45.454
Well, the figures that
I have got is 240,000,

246
00:13:45.454 --> 00:13:47.204
that is the latest figures.

247
00:13:47.204 --> 00:13:49.371
The average of people
being tested every day?

248
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:50.579
The capacity in the system.

249
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:53.704
We know about the capacity,
but in terms of people being tested,

250
00:13:53.704 --> 00:13:56.787
which is what everyone here is,
if you want a test, the capacity

251
00:13:56.787 --> 00:13:59.204
is kind of irrelevant,
if you cannot get a test,

252
00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:01.121
it does not matter
what the capacity is.

253
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:05.121
As I said, there
are some challenges.

254
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:10.162
The 90% of people can get
to a testing facility within 22

255
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:14.204
miles of where they are at,
but we have to do better

256
00:14:14.204 --> 00:14:17.204
which is why we are increasing
capacity to half a million

257
00:14:17.204 --> 00:14:22.204
by the end of October and of course
Test and Trace will get even better.

258
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:25.412
It is running at the moment
at just shy of 70%.

259
00:14:25.412 --> 00:14:28.329
360,000 people have been identified
and have isolated through their Test

260
00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:33.287
and Trace system and we continue.

261
00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:38.329
Yesterday, we e—mailed schools
so they can actually get a home

262
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:41.746
testing kit to each school
and they can go on to a dedicated

263
00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:44.121
portal and order those.

264
00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:46.079
One kit?

265
00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:47.829
No.

266
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:51.579
Ten tests per school.

267
00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:55.371
No, there is more going
into schools as they need them.

268
00:14:55.371 --> 00:15:00.371
The thing with children, of course,
the vast majority actually

269
00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:05.454
are testing negative,
which is good news.

270
00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:09.912
90%, 99% of schools are back
with 88% attendance,

271
00:15:09.912 --> 00:15:14.912
I think Nicci was talking about how
we are doing with the school system,

272
00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:20.246
so many challenges, and I would not
sit here and claim that this...

273
00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:21.912
World beating.

274
00:15:21.912 --> 00:15:25.162
That it is going exactly
as I would hope to go,

275
00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:30.121
but we are constantly improving
and some incredible people,

276
00:15:31.662 --> 00:15:33.371
incredible scientists,
incredible people in the NHS,

277
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:35.537
in our hospitals, in our
laboratories, for new laboratories

278
00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:39.787
will come online which will increase
capacity even more.

279
00:15:48.496 --> 00:15:54.329
It’s difficult, but it is the right
thing to do. Nobody is denying if

280
00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.454
thing to do. Nobody is denying if
question -- if

281
00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:56.454
thing to do. Nobody is denying if
question —— if testing is the right

282
00:15:56.454 --> 00:15:57.829
question -- if testing is the right
thing to do, it is

283
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:58.454
question —— if testing is the right
thing to do, it is if there is

284
00:15:58.454 --> 00:15:59.454
thing to do, it is if there is
enough. I

285
00:15:59.454 --> 00:15:59.704
thing to do, it is if there is
enough. Isit

286
00:15:59.704 --> 00:16:00.704
thing to do, it is if there is
enough. I sit on the committee that

287
00:16:00.704 --> 00:16:03.371
enough. I sit on the committee that
looks at this data every day. We

288
00:16:03.371 --> 00:16:05.829
looks at this data every day. We
identify the spikes which is why

289
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:07.621
identify the spikes which is why
with the local leadership, as we

290
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:08.037
with the [oral leadership, as we
have just

291
00:16:08.037 --> 00:16:08.162
with the local leadership, as we
have just done

292
00:16:08.162 --> 00:16:08.371
with the local leadership, as we
havejust done in

293
00:16:08.371 --> 00:16:09.371
with the local leadership, as we
have just done in the north—east and

294
00:16:09.371 --> 00:16:10.412
have just done in the north-east and
by the way, or

295
00:16:10.412 --> 00:16:12.121
have just done in the north—east and
by the way, or the local Labour MPs

296
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:13.162
by the way, or the [oral labour MPs
have been very

297
00:16:13.162 --> 00:16:13.579
by the way, or the local Labour MPs
have been very supportive this

298
00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:18.079
have been very supportive this
evening. We have announced the

299
00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:18.996
evening. We have announced the
additional interventions we are

300
00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:20.371
additional interventions we are
making in the north—east to try and

301
00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:20.579
making in the north-east to try and
control

302
00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:25.162
making in the north—east to try and
control the virus. As you will have

303
00:16:25.162 --> 00:16:25.871
control the vims. As you will have
seen, people in

304
00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:26.537
control the virus. As you will have
seen, people in the north—east, a

305
00:16:26.537 --> 00:16:27.454
seen, people in the north-east, a
lot of people

306
00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.871
seen, people in the north—east, a
lot of people are not getting tests

307
00:16:28.871 --> 00:16:29.287
lot of peopla are not getting tests
and peopla

308
00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:30.079
lot of people are not getting tests
and people turned up in Sunderland

309
00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.121
and peopla turned up in Sundertand
to a test

310
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:33.079
and people turned up in Sunderland
to a test site today and nobody was

311
00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:35.287
to a test site today and nobody was
there to test them. Let’s hear from

312
00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:39.079
there to test them. Let’s hear from
the audience. Michael. It looks like

313
00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:41.246
the audience. Michael. It looks like
Nadhim is struggling with that

314
00:16:41.246 --> 00:16:41.412
Nadhim is stmggling with that
fantasy

315
00:16:41.412 --> 00:16:43.037
Nadhim is struggling with that
fantasy figure. It’s difficult when

316
00:16:43.037 --> 00:16:44.121
fantasy figure. It’s difficult when
you get these numbers which don’t

317
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:46.454
you get these numbers which don’t
their reality to what is happening.

318
00:16:46.454 --> 00:16:48.912
their reality to what is happening.
But to respond to the question,

319
00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:50.246
But to respond to the question,
nobody wanted a world beating Track

320
00:16:50.246 --> 00:16:54.329
nobody wanted a world beating Track
and Trace system, we wanted an

321
00:16:54.329 --> 00:16:55.496
and Trace system, we wanted an
effective one. Johnson himself

322
00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:58.412
effective one. Johnson himself
blurted out it will be world

323
00:16:58.412 --> 00:17:00.079
blurted out it will be world
beating. What is happening clearly

324
00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:00.454
beating. what is happening dearty
is that

325
00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:04.037
beating. What is happening clearly
is that the announcement seems to be

326
00:17:04.037 --> 00:17:05.579
is that the announcement seems to be
better rewarded than the actual

327
00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:11.454
better rewarded than the actual
workability of the system itself.

328
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:15.037
workability of the system itself.
Hello. I believe over 100 schools in

329
00:17:15.037 --> 00:17:16.246
Hello. I believe over 100 schools in
the Greater Manchester area have now

330
00:17:16.246 --> 00:17:20.537
the Greater Manchester area have now
had to close or have had to send

331
00:17:20.537 --> 00:17:20.829
had to dose or have had to send
children

332
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.537
had to close or have had to send
children home in Bubbles because of

333
00:17:23.537 --> 00:17:23.621
children home in Bubbles because of
coronavims,

334
00:17:23.621 --> 00:17:24.704
children home in Bubbles because of
coronavirus, positive tests. 50 is

335
00:17:24.704 --> 00:17:25.079
coronavims, positive tests. So is
the view

336
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.537
coronavirus, positive tests. 50 is
the view of the government that herd

337
00:17:26.537 --> 00:17:28.162
the view of the government that herd
immunity is now the best way forward

338
00:17:28.162 --> 00:17:30.287
immunity is now the best way forward
simply because we can’t cope with

339
00:17:30.287 --> 00:17:32.079
simply because we can’t cope with
the amount of tests required and we

340
00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:34.662
the amount of tests required and we
can’t keep the country in lockdown

341
00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:38.787
can’t keep the country in lockdown
forever? Martin. After the way Dido

342
00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:42.579
forever? Martin. After the way Dido

TalkTalk and today saying nobody saw

the demand for tests coming, is her

345
00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:48.996
the demand for tests coming, is her
credibility and the credibility of

346
00:17:48.996 --> 00:17:53.121
credibility and the credibility of
the testing system shot and it needs

347
00:17:53.121 --> 00:17:55.121
the testing system shot and it needs
a drastic rethink? Ben. I was

348
00:17:55.121 --> 00:17:55.204
the testing system shot and it needs
a drastic rethink? Ben. I wasjust

349
00:17:55.204 --> 00:17:55.746
a drastic rethink? Ben. Iwas just
thinking, going

350
00:17:55.746 --> 00:17:57.371
a drastic rethink? Ben. I wasjust
thinking, going forward into the

351
00:17:57.371 --> 00:17:59.037
thinking, going forward into the
winter months, test and traces of

352
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.079
winter months, test and traces of
vital component for the nation

353
00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.787
vital component for the nation
puzzlement health and getting the

354
00:18:02.787 --> 00:18:03.704
puzzlement health and getting the
health service is better prepared.

355
00:18:03.704 --> 00:18:05.871
health service is better prepared.
We don’t want to play catch up and

356
00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:06.662
We don’t want to play catch up and
when ran

357
00:18:06.662 --> 00:18:09.079
We don’t want to play catch up and
when can we be expecting a fully

when ran we be expecting a fully

an efficient one? Nadhim, I will

364
00:18:17.621 --> 00:18:20.204
an efficient one? Nadhim, I will
come back to you, but Sunetra, the

365
00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:23.329
come back to you, but Sunetra, the
original question is, is this a

00:18:23.329 --> 00:18:24.871
original question is, is this a

BorisJohnson promised? And we have

369
00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:26.787
Boris johnson promised? And we have
heard

370
00:18:26.787 --> 00:18:29.329
BorisJohnson promised? And we have
heard whether it is the right way to

371
00:18:29.329 --> 00:18:31.746
heard whether it is the right way to
go anyway. It is of history clearly

372
00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:32.162
go anyway. It is of history dearty
not a

373
00:18:32.162 --> 00:18:32.662
go anyway. It is of history clearly
not a world beating

374
00:18:32.662 --> 00:18:36.246
go anyway. It is of history clearly
not a world heating system. —— it is

375
00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:37.079
not a world heating system. -- it is
dearty not a

376
00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:37.496
not a world heating system. —— it is
clearly not a world beating

377
00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:38.037
not a world heating system. —— it is
clearly not a world heating system.

378
00:18:38.037 --> 00:18:38.704
dearty not a world heating system.
But the point

379
00:18:38.704 --> 00:18:39.954
clearly not a world heating system.
But the point you made, John, is

380
00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:41.246
But the point you made, john, is
this really

381
00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.079
But the point you made, John, is
this really what we want to do? You

382
00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:44.787
this really what we want to do? You
just said, Fiona, nobody is arguing

383
00:18:44.787 --> 00:18:47.204
just said, Fiona, nobody is arguing
this is the way forward and we must

384
00:18:47.204 --> 00:18:50.204
this is the way forward and we must
attest. But I will argue against

385
00:18:50.204 --> 00:18:53.579
attest. But I will argue against
that. I think we are all talking to

386
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:55.496
that. I think we are all talking to
a particular narrative, a particular

387
00:18:55.496 --> 00:18:57.746
a particular narrative, a particular
plot, which is that the virus is

388
00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:02.704
plot, which is that the virus is
this nasty thing which may have

389
00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:03.871
this nasty thing which may have
diminished in nastiness, although I

390
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:05.496
diminished in nastiness, although I
don’t think that’s true. Because

391
00:19:05.496 --> 00:19:07.287
don’t think that’s tme. Because
what I

392
00:19:07.287 --> 00:19:08.787
don’t think that’s true. Because
what I think is the virus was never

393
00:19:08.787 --> 00:19:11.871
what I think is the virus was never
really that nasty to begin with. And

394
00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:13.496
really that nasty to begin with. And
how are we are going to deal with

395
00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:15.662
how are we are going to deal with
it? The only way we can deal with it

396
00:19:15.662 --> 00:19:16.287
it? The only way we ran deal with it
is by somehow

397
00:19:16.287 --> 00:19:16.996
it? The only way we can deal with it
is by somehow keeping it under

398
00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:20.787
is by somehow keeping it under
control.

399
00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:24.537
When you say it wasn’t that
nasty to begin with —

400
00:19:24.537 --> 00:19:27.579
16,000 deaths and counting

401
00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:29.787
sounds a pretty nasty
thing to lots of people.

402
00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:32.912
I mean, what I’m saying is that
in relation to flu, or other...

403
00:19:32.912 --> 00:19:37.912
I mean, 0K, what I mean
by "was it a nasty thing?"

404
00:19:38.912 --> 00:19:42.246
is, is it any nastier, or less nasty
now, than it was in April?

405
00:19:42.246 --> 00:19:44.454
And I mean, it depends,
obviously, as you say,

406
00:19:44.454 --> 00:19:46.912
whether we consider something that
could kill 16,000

407
00:19:46.912 --> 00:19:51.871
people to be nasty.

408
00:19:52.954 --> 00:19:56.037
And in relation to other pathogens
that we have around that do kill

409
00:19:56.037 --> 00:20:01.079
a lot of other people.

410
00:20:02.037 --> 00:20:05.662
So, I guess that’s what I meant is —
it is virulent, but it’s not

411
00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:07.829
necessarily any more virulent
than many of the other

412
00:20:07.829 --> 00:20:08.829
pathogens we deal with.

413
00:20:08.829 --> 00:20:12.204
But really, what I wanted to say
was that the reason why this virus

414
00:20:12.204 --> 00:20:17.204
was able to kill so many people
at that stage was because the risk

415
00:20:17.454 --> 00:20:19.954
of being infected among
the vulnerable people was really

416
00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:24.912
very high in April,
and that has diminished.

417
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:31.037
And you mentioned six factors,
but there’s a seventh factor,

418
00:20:31.037 --> 00:20:33.871
which is that many of us are now
immune to this virus.

419
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:37.329
So, what we need to do
is really rethink.

420
00:20:37.329 --> 00:20:42.287
Yeah, butjust to answer that point,
I wasn’t bringing the immunity

421
00:20:44.871 --> 00:20:47.746
in because I was talking
about the ratio of deaths to cases,

422
00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.412
so that automatically discounts
the immunity factor.

423
00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:51.537
No, it doesn’t, actually,
because what happens

424
00:20:51.537 --> 00:20:54.412
is when a population becomes immune,
the risk of infection goes down.

425
00:20:54.412 --> 00:20:56.329
And so, what we really
want to stop...

426
00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:57.787
But that’s the number of cases.

427
00:20:57.787 --> 00:21:00.412
I was just talking of the ratio
of deaths to cases.

428
00:21:00.412 --> 00:21:01.829
Not the cases per population.

429
00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:06.829
Can Ijustjump in for a second?

430
00:21:07.204 --> 00:21:10.329
Tyra in our audience was saying,
is herd immunity the way to go?

431
00:21:10.329 --> 00:21:11.496
Is that your view, Sunetra?

432
00:21:11.496 --> 00:21:14.162
Um, I’m just saying that there
is this other alternative pathway,

433
00:21:14.162 --> 00:21:16.287
which is to build up herd immunity,
without sacrificing

434
00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:17.329
the vulnerable people.

435
00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:18.829
And...

436
00:21:18.829 --> 00:21:23.787
And I absolutely agree with that.

437
00:21:23.787 --> 00:21:28.704
And I’ve been making the point
from day one that we should have

438
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.079
invested the money into protecting
the aged and the vulnerable

439
00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:36.079
and let everybody else
build up herd immunity.

440
00:21:41.287 --> 00:21:43.662
And if you take the number
of deaths that there

441
00:21:43.662 --> 00:21:46.537
would have been incurred then,
I believe there would have been way

442
00:21:46.537 --> 00:21:47.746
less doing it that way

443
00:21:47.746 --> 00:21:50.621
than what we’re doing cumulatively
by the corona deaths that we’ve got,

444
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.537
the cancer deaths that
we’re going to have,

445
00:21:52.537 --> 00:21:54.954
the stroke deaths that we’re
going to have, the suicides,

446
00:21:54.954 --> 00:21:57.079
the mental illness and
the destruction of the economy.

447
00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:59.996
This is not lives or the economy,
this is lives or lives.

448
00:21:59.996 --> 00:22:02.121
I think we’ve handled it
wrongly from the beginning.

449
00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:04.537
I understand why Boris has done
that, because he’s followed

450
00:22:04.537 --> 00:22:05.954
the rest of the world.

451
00:22:05.954 --> 00:22:07.454
Except for Sweden.

452
00:22:07.454 --> 00:22:10.079
And you can’t really go
against the rest of the world.

453
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:12.496
Otherwise, you’d be absolutely
pilloried if you got it wrong.

454
00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:14.412
But I do believe we’ve got it wrong.

455
00:22:14.412 --> 00:22:16.579
I do believe we’ve been
doing the wrong thing.

456
00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:20.246
And I do believe we’re doing
the wrong thing now.

457
00:22:20.246 --> 00:22:25.204
And we really need to understand,
how deadly is this virus?

458
00:22:29.954 --> 00:22:32.829
And from the figures I’m seeing,
the virus is not that deadly,

459
00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:33.912
for those six reasons.

460
00:22:33.912 --> 00:22:36.037
And the Government and
the scientists need to understand

461
00:22:36.037 --> 00:22:41.037
the weighting behind those six
reasons, so that we make

462
00:22:42.246 --> 00:22:43.287
the appropriate decisions.

463
00:22:43.287 --> 00:22:44.537
So, are you saying that...

464
00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:46.662
I mean, we’ve got a Professor
of theoretical epidemiology.

465
00:22:46.662 --> 00:22:48.621
Are you saying you know
better than Sunetra?

466
00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:50.037
I didn’t say that, did I?

467
00:22:50.037 --> 00:22:52.454
Well, Sunetra thinks it is more
deadly than you’re saying.

468
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:56.037
No, I’m agreeing with what she said,
but you don’t have to be a Professor

469
00:22:56.037 --> 00:22:57.954
to read the statistics
and understand the facts.

470
00:22:57.954 --> 00:23:00.079
You just need to have
a degree of intellect.

471
00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:02.246
Nicci, you had your hand
on your head there.

472
00:23:02.246 --> 00:23:04.912
I wasn’t quite sure whether that
meant you approved or disapproved.

473
00:23:04.912 --> 00:23:06.621
I’m a bit baffled
by this conversation.

474
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:09.204
I mean, it seems to me that clearly,
Covid—19 is deadly.

475
00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:11.579
Clearly, it’s deadly
for people who are vulnerable,

476
00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:14.829
for people who have underlying
health conditions, and for people

477
00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:19.787
who are old and for people
who have dementia.

478
00:23:20.329 --> 00:23:24.996
I’m really unhappy at the idea that
you somehow so shield that section

479
00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:27.871
of society that you almost build
a well within the society,

480
00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:30.704
so there are some people
who are being kind of locked up

481
00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:33.621
in their homes and some people
who are free to go out

482
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:36.246
into the world and have a nice time.

483
00:23:36.246 --> 00:23:41.246
It seems to me that what we have
to think about is ways of dealing

484
00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:45.704
with the epidemic and then ways
of living alongside

485
00:23:45.704 --> 00:23:50.579
the epidemic, and those things
can be done together.

486
00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:55.204
So, it’s true, Ithink, that
in the name of a national emergency,

487
00:23:55.204 --> 00:24:00.079
lots of things have been done
which I find quite scary.

488
00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:02.662
I was mentioning earlier people
being kept out of care homes

489
00:24:02.662 --> 00:24:03.996
where their relatives are.

490
00:24:03.996 --> 00:24:07.454
People not getting cancer treatment.

491
00:24:07.454 --> 00:24:09.871
Lots of domestic abuse
going on because people are locked

492
00:24:09.871 --> 00:24:14.829
up in tiny little flats.

493
00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:18.912
So, I think we need to have a proper
grown—up conversation

494
00:24:18.912 --> 00:24:21.746
about how to best deal
with a pandemic and how to live

495
00:24:21.746 --> 00:24:25.662
with a pandemic so that,
at the other end of it,

496
00:24:25.662 --> 00:24:28.746
there is notjust the most enormous
legacy of unresolved grief and guilt

497
00:24:28.746 --> 00:24:30.287
and damage and depression.

498
00:24:30.287 --> 00:24:35.246
And we’re not doing either of those
things at the moment.

499
00:24:38.496 --> 00:24:41.287
Let’s keep on this topic,
but I want to take another question.

500
00:24:41.287 --> 00:24:42.371
Anna Wood.

501
00:24:42.371 --> 00:24:44.537
So, not quite two weeks
into the academic year,

502
00:24:44.537 --> 00:24:47.204
I’m aware that local schools
in Bolton are already sending whole

503
00:24:47.204 --> 00:24:50.246
year groups home to quarantine
for two weeks due to one or perhaps

504
00:24:50.246 --> 00:24:53.579
two cases of Covid.

505
00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:56.496
Surely, given the nature of Covid,
this could happen again once these

506
00:24:56.496 --> 00:24:58.579
children return to school
after the two weeks?

507
00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:01.454
I was wondering if there was a less
disruptive way to manage

508
00:25:01.454 --> 00:25:02.537
outbreaks in schools?

509
00:25:02.537 --> 00:25:04.704
And, Anna, you’re a primary school
teacher, aren’t you?

510
00:25:04.704 --> 00:25:06.662
lam, yeah.

511
00:25:06.662 --> 00:25:09.329
So, you’ve heard Nadhim talking
about what he’s intending to do

512
00:25:09.329 --> 00:25:11.746
with schools and what’s been done
for schools so far.

513
00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:12.746
Is that enough?

514
00:25:12.746 --> 00:25:15.621
Do you think that will resolve it,
as far as you’re concerned?

515
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:20.662
Erm, I think that, erm...

516
00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:27.079
As we are at the moment, everything
seems to be unsure really,

517
00:25:27.954 --> 00:25:30.871
because there are whole year groups
going home and they’ve onlyjust

518
00:25:30.871 --> 00:25:34.162
come back in for a week.

519
00:25:34.162 --> 00:25:37.162
They’ve only had a week in and,
already, they’ve been sent

520
00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:41.037
home for a further two
weeks to quarantine.

521
00:25:41.037 --> 00:25:43.662
So, itjust seems like it’s
a disruption again, after they’ve

522
00:25:43.662 --> 00:25:45.412
already had six months off school.

523
00:25:45.412 --> 00:25:47.579
What, it feels like a revolving
door, you’re saying?

524
00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:50.912
Yeah, itjust keeps
going on and on for us.

525
00:25:50.912 --> 00:25:55.954
And I just think that I’ve
already seen massive gaps

526
00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:03.579
in the learning of the children,
you know, they’ve fallen

527
00:26:03.579 --> 00:26:06.287
behind, and they really
need to be in school.

528
00:26:06.287 --> 00:26:08.912
So, Sunetra, given yourview
of the pandemic and an alternative

529
00:26:08.912 --> 00:26:11.787
way of handling it, what do you say
to someone like Anna?

530
00:26:11.787 --> 00:26:13.121
Well, precisely.

531
00:26:13.121 --> 00:26:17.787
I mean, when I said the disease
wasn’t deadly, what I meant,

532
00:26:17.787 --> 00:26:21.079
of course, was precisely that —
that it’s not deadly in a very large

533
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.204
sector of the population.

534
00:26:23.204 --> 00:26:27.996
So, that presents us
with this workable solution,

535
00:26:27.996 --> 00:26:31.829
whereby we can stop testing them,
let them get on with their lives,

536
00:26:31.829 --> 00:26:36.871
let them go to school and receive
something that is incredibly

537
00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:40.412
valuable to them, which is education
and training, let people keepjobs,

538
00:26:40.412 --> 00:26:41.579
let them feed their children.

539
00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:45.787
Let’s preserve all of these things.

540
00:26:45.787 --> 00:26:50.787
Let the Arts continue, or resume,
and continue to flourish.

541
00:26:52.537 --> 00:26:54.912
We can do all this by
aggressively protecting —

542
00:26:54.912 --> 00:26:59.954
I think maybe shielding is not
the right word — aggressively

543
00:27:05.621 --> 00:27:08.037
protecting those who are indeed
vulnerable to this infection —

544
00:27:08.037 --> 00:27:10.704
which, of course, I apologise,
of course it can be very

545
00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:12.621
deadly in a certain sector
of the population.

546
00:27:12.621 --> 00:27:15.037
The good news is, we know
now who is vulnerable,

547
00:27:15.037 --> 00:27:16.162
to a very large degree.

548
00:27:16.162 --> 00:27:17.204
We know that.

549
00:27:17.204 --> 00:27:18.287
And we also know...

550
00:27:18.287 --> 00:27:21.537
What are the things
we really know in this?

551
00:27:21.537 --> 00:27:24.121
We know who’s vulnerable and we know
about the enormous costs

552
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:25.371
of some of these measures.

553
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:28.454
How can we balance these?

554
00:27:28.454 --> 00:27:33.496
We can balance these
by using our tests to find creative

555
00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:37.996
solutions to protect the vulnerable,
notjust shield them and shut them

556
00:27:37.996 --> 00:27:42.246
up and box them away,
but ways of protecting them

557
00:27:42.246 --> 00:27:45.329
by testing people who they’ll be
in contact with and making sure

558
00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:50.246
that they won’t pass the virus
on to them.

559
00:27:53.412 --> 00:27:56.037
By creating the conditions whereby
they are at a low risk

560
00:27:56.037 --> 00:27:58.704
of contracting this virus,
which has not diminished

561
00:27:58.704 --> 00:28:01.329
in its potency, but is currently
now held at low risk.

562
00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:03.621
But we cannot hold it
at low risk forever,

563
00:28:03.621 --> 00:28:05.496
without paying these extreme costs.

564
00:28:05.496 --> 00:28:07.162
So...

565
00:28:07.162 --> 00:28:10.704
I absolutely agree
with what you’re saying.

566
00:28:10.704 --> 00:28:13.329
I just wondered why you think,
or know, that the virus

567
00:28:13.329 --> 00:28:15.329
is not losing its potency?

568
00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:16.996
Well, because it doesn’t
mutate very quickly.

569
00:28:16.996 --> 00:28:18.079
It doesn’t change much.

570
00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:22.704
There is no...

571
00:28:22.704 --> 00:28:26.454
I mean, we don’t know anything
for certain about this virus,

572
00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:29.079
but it hasn’t really changed in ways
that would biologically suggest

573
00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:32.537
that it has become less virulent.

574
00:28:32.537 --> 00:28:37.579
But what has happened is that levels
of infection have declined

575
00:28:37.871 --> 00:28:41.537
considerably since April,
and the way people die

576
00:28:41.537 --> 00:28:43.704
is when those infections leak
into the vulnerable sector.

577
00:28:43.704 --> 00:28:44.787
Yeah.

578
00:28:44.787 --> 00:28:49.746
So, that’s what we need to stop.

579
00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:53.412
Jon Ashworth, are you persuaded
at all by what you’ve been hearing?

580
00:28:53.412 --> 00:28:54.746
No, not really.

581
00:28:54.746 --> 00:28:58.996
I mean, I fully respect what you’re
saying, quite obviously, and I’m

582
00:28:58.996 --> 00:29:01.912
very aware of your background
in this field.

583
00:29:01.912 --> 00:29:03.912
Although there are other
epidemiologists who take

584
00:29:03.912 --> 00:29:06.787
a slightly different view
to you, of course.

585
00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:09.162
And you are quite right
that the numbers of deaths

586
00:29:09.162 --> 00:29:10.162
have been coming down.

587
00:29:10.162 --> 00:29:12.746
That is something
we should celebrate.

588
00:29:12.746 --> 00:29:15.829
But it is a virus that spreads
with speed and severity.

589
00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:18.621
And we also know that there
are increasing numbers of people

590
00:29:18.621 --> 00:29:21.912
in younger age brackets who have
caught the virus.

591
00:29:21.912 --> 00:29:25.121
And, yes, they may not have been
admitted to intensive

592
00:29:25.121 --> 00:29:28.246
care in a hospital,
but they are suffering

593
00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:30.621
from debilitating long—term
conditions as a result of the virus.

594
00:29:30.621 --> 00:29:31.704
Now, obviously...

595
00:29:31.704 --> 00:29:33.121
But that’s true of many viruses.

596
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:34.371
Sorry?

597
00:29:34.371 --> 00:29:35.787
But that’s true of many viruses.

598
00:29:35.787 --> 00:29:38.704
Well, it’s very true, but it’s not
very pleasant to get it.

599
00:29:38.704 --> 00:29:41.079
It’s not very pleasant
for the people who’ve got it.

600
00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.787
Because it’s a multi—organ
virus, isn’t it?

601
00:29:42.787 --> 00:29:43.996
That’s also true of flu.

602
00:29:43.996 --> 00:29:45.037
Sorry?

603
00:29:45.037 --> 00:29:46.204
That’s also true of flu.

604
00:29:46.204 --> 00:29:47.954
Fine, let everybody
get it and just...

605
00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:51.537
You know, that is not,
if I may say so...

606
00:29:51.537 --> 00:29:54.496
Why would everybody get it?

607
00:29:54.496 --> 00:29:57.871
If I may say so, I do not believe
allowing people to be exposed

608
00:29:57.871 --> 00:30:00.996
to a virus that we know is deadly
or creates serious long—term health

609
00:30:00.996 --> 00:30:05.162
problems for them is the right,
is the rightjudgment.

610
00:30:05.162 --> 00:30:07.121
Then why don’t you
shut down for flu?

611
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:10.246
..is not the rightjudgment for us
to make as policymakers.

612
00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:13.371
We are trying to protect people,
to save lives and to drive down

613
00:30:13.371 --> 00:30:18.329
infections as best we can.

614
00:30:18.537 --> 00:30:21.162
But the way in which we do
that is by investing

615
00:30:21.162 --> 00:30:23.079
properly in a decent testing
and tracing system.

616
00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:25.704
We do not have decent testing
and tracing at the moment.

617
00:30:25.704 --> 00:30:30.746
Which is why we’ve got hundreds
of schoolchildren starting

618
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:32.787
this
school term in the same way

619
00:30:32.787 --> 00:30:34.496
they ended the last school term —

620
00:30:34.496 --> 00:30:35.954
at home and not in education.

621
00:30:35.954 --> 00:30:36.996
All right.

622
00:30:36.996 --> 00:30:38.037
Let...

623
00:30:38.037 --> 00:30:40.662
Let me just make this point,
because I just think you’re

624
00:30:40.662 --> 00:30:41.871
on a party political broadcast.

625
00:30:41.871 --> 00:30:44.287
You know, you’ve listened
to what I’ve said, you’ve listened

626
00:30:44.287 --> 00:30:46.662
to what an expert said and you’ve
dismissed it completely

627
00:30:46.662 --> 00:30:49.287
because you want to nail
the Government on Test and Trace.

628
00:30:49.287 --> 00:30:50.746
No, I want to save lives.

629
00:30:50.746 --> 00:30:51.787
And that’s not fair.

630
00:30:51.787 --> 00:30:53.204
I want to save lives, actually.

631
00:30:53.204 --> 00:30:54.871
No, you don’t want to save lives.

632
00:30:54.871 --> 00:30:56.829
I do actually want
to save lives, John.

633
00:30:56.829 --> 00:30:59.454
You just want to let the virus rip
through the population.

634
00:30:59.454 --> 00:31:00.496
No, absolutely not.

635
00:31:00.496 --> 00:31:01.746
We’re killing people with cancer.

636
00:31:01.746 --> 00:31:04.079
We’re killing young people
with cancer to protect young people

637
00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:05.537
who won’t die of this virus.

638
00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:07.954
We absolutely need to protect
the aged and the infirm.

639
00:31:07.954 --> 00:31:09.662
I’ve been saying
that for six months.

640
00:31:09.662 --> 00:31:11.287
We have to...

641
00:31:11.287 --> 00:31:13.746
Whether we call it shielding
or what sort of protection,

642
00:31:13.746 --> 00:31:16.829
we have to protect them to the nth
degree and let everybody else

643
00:31:16.829 --> 00:31:19.454
carry on with the work,
and there will be less deaths

644
00:31:19.454 --> 00:31:20.912
overall, I have no doubt whatsoever.

645
00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:23.079
But you won’t even listen
to what we’re saying.

646
00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:28.079
I disagree.

647
00:31:38.829 --> 00:31:41.037
..Because you want to push your
party political broadcast...

648
00:31:41.037 --> 00:31:42.162
I respectfully disagree with you.

649
00:31:42.162 --> 00:31:43.204
No, let me finish.

650
00:31:43.204 --> 00:31:44.912
..that the Conservative Party
are failing miserably.

651
00:31:44.912 --> 00:31:45.954
Well, they have.

652
00:31:45.954 --> 00:31:48.371
They are failing on testing,
you said that as well.

653
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:50.746
Yeah, I’m not disagreeing
with that, but what I don’t

654
00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:51.954
like is the fact that...

655
00:31:51.954 --> 00:31:54.621
Well, why are you criticising me
when I make the same

656
00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:55.621
point that you make?

657
00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:58.246
What I don’t like is that you’re
sticking to your guns,

658
00:31:58.246 --> 00:32:00.162
but you don’t even listen
to the argument...

659
00:32:00.162 --> 00:32:01.871
I have listened,
I disagree with you.

660
00:32:01.871 --> 00:32:04.246
..that there’s a different way
of dealing with this virus.

661
00:32:04.246 --> 00:32:05.454
I completely disagree with you.

662
00:32:05.454 --> 00:32:07.162
Can I make the point — lives.

663
00:32:07.162 --> 00:32:09.079
Notjust lives in this
country, lives around

664
00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:10.079
the world, globally, lives.

665
00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:11.537
We need to save those lives.

666
00:32:11.537 --> 00:32:14.412
We need to make sure 160 million
people don’t starve to death.

667
00:32:14.412 --> 00:32:19.454
That’s really important.

668
00:32:19.454 --> 00:32:21.371
I am following Anna’s question.

669
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:24.454
I am a lecturer at college
and exactly what Anna said in terms

670
00:32:24.454 --> 00:32:27.621
of after two weeks isolation,
we could end up in the same vote.

671
00:32:27.621 --> 00:32:30.454
My issue is, how long
are we going to play catch up?

672
00:32:30.454 --> 00:32:33.079
It is notjust education,
it is the NHS and it

673
00:32:33.079 --> 00:32:35.954
is also the economy.

674
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:39.079
Everything was just shut down and we
are still not at full capacity,

675
00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:40.496
when will we ever get there?

676
00:32:40.496 --> 00:32:44.037
We will constantly be on that
wheel, playing catch up.

677
00:32:44.037 --> 00:32:48.371
Peter.

678
00:32:48.371 --> 00:32:53.329
Hi there.

679
00:32:54.496 --> 00:32:56.912
This question is for Sunetra,
because she is an epidemiologist

680
00:32:56.912 --> 00:32:57.954
and a specialist.

681
00:32:57.954 --> 00:33:01.079
I do kind of admire her more relaxed
approach, although would she say

682
00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:06.037
the sort of preconditions that have
perhaps facilitated the growth

683
00:33:06.037 --> 00:33:08.121
and creation of this virus,
in terms of degradation

684
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:12.412
of the environment and pollution
etc, do you think that there

685
00:33:12.412 --> 00:33:17.454
is something in the future that
could cause much more damage,

686
00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:21.371
if we aren’t protecting
the environment as much

687
00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:28.787
I’m going to move around
the audience as quickly as I can.

688
00:33:28.787 --> 00:33:31.079
Carol.

689
00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:36.079
I work in a pharmacy and just this
week they have introduced the flu

690
00:33:37.787 --> 00:33:39.329
vaccination for the over 655.

691
00:33:39.329 --> 00:33:40.496
It has been extremely popular.

692
00:33:40.496 --> 00:33:42.954
People in general are so frightened
ofjust becoming ill

693
00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:43.996
and being vulnerable.

694
00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:47.079
Not only to Covid, but to flu
and the condition it can cause,

695
00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:49.454
especially for those
with underlying conditions.

696
00:33:49.454 --> 00:33:54.412
Patients are just not getting
access to the doctors.

697
00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:58.412
There are services we would
normally take for granted.

698
00:33:58.412 --> 00:34:02.162
We are very lucky with the NHS.

699
00:34:02.162 --> 00:34:07.162
There are still a lot of loopholes
where the NHS are not filling them.

700
00:34:07.204 --> 00:34:09.829
Six weeks for an appointment
for someone who is feeling very

701
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:13.996
stressed or depressed or has
an underlying condition,

702
00:34:13.996 --> 00:34:17.829
because of something
they are already suffering from,

703
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:20.496
diabetes and asthma for example,
heart conditions, they have just not

704
00:34:20.496 --> 00:34:23.621
been able to get access to normal
NHS care, and if they do

705
00:34:23.621 --> 00:34:26.746
get the coronavirus,
they feel like they are going

706
00:34:26.746 --> 00:34:30.704
to be lost.

707
00:34:30.704 --> 00:34:35.162
0K, Tuesday.

708
00:34:35.162 --> 00:34:40.121
My question is, with winter
approaching, what is the

709
00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.871
government’s coronavirus winter plan
and how will they facilitate

710
00:34:43.871 --> 00:34:46.454
the NHS to cope with winter
pressures and a potential second

711
00:34:46.454 --> 00:34:47.537
wave?

712
00:34:47.537 --> 00:34:51.079
Nadhim, I am going to come to you,
Ijust want to hear one more,

713
00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:52.121
from Matt.

714
00:34:52.121 --> 00:34:54.329
My question was,
and there are a lot of

715
00:34:54.329 --> 00:34:56.996
different opinions out there,
but what does the panel think of

716
00:34:56.996 --> 00:34:58.912
Professor Whitty’s alleged comments
about two—week national lockdown?

717
00:34:58.912 --> 00:35:03.246
There is lots of talk, Nadhim,
a two—week lockdown could be coming,

718
00:35:03.246 --> 00:35:05.412
if we do not get the
infection rate down.

719
00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:08.037
Is that likely?

720
00:35:08.037 --> 00:35:13.079
Well, we have got the rule
of six now, which I

721
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:20.537
think it will make a difference,
as well as the local

722
00:35:20.537 --> 00:35:22.162
interventions with Oldham and,
of course, the

723
00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:24.329
north—east now and Leicester
and Manchester and other areas,

724
00:35:24.329 --> 00:35:26.537
Birmingham and Solihull
in my part of the world.

725
00:35:26.537 --> 00:35:31.537
One in seven people are living
under restrictions now.

726
00:35:33.204 --> 00:35:36.579
If we all do the right thing
and this is where I think Tyra’s

727
00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:38.246
question about herd immunity,
which the professor,

728
00:35:38.246 --> 00:35:41.121
with all respect, what I have seen
in the data is a

729
00:35:41.121 --> 00:35:46.121
big spike in those areas.

730
00:35:53.162 --> 00:35:55.079
Notjust amongst the 17—
Ao—year—olds, which I

731
00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:57.246
thinkJohn was referring
to, but it is actually

732
00:35:57.246 --> 00:35:58.287
going further into
the

733
00:35:58.287 --> 00:35:59.329
50 and 55 euros.

734
00:35:59.329 --> 00:36:01.246
And we are beginning
to see, in other

735
00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:02.704
countries, like Spain,
the hospital admissions

736
00:36:02.704 --> 00:36:07.746
rise as well, so Tyra,
this idea of herd immunity is wrong.

737
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:12.162
The right thing to do is to make
sure that we all follow, you know,

738
00:36:12.162 --> 00:36:14.079
hands, face, space and,
of course, the rule

739
00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.246
of six, which is why
we

740
00:36:16.246 --> 00:36:18.371
have introduced, both
the police and local

741
00:36:18.371 --> 00:36:20.662
government have said to us,
we

742
00:36:20.662 --> 00:36:23.454
want simplicity and straightforward
message to bring the prevalence

743
00:36:23.454 --> 00:36:25.829
down.

744
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:28.912
The prevalence of the virus has shot
up, which is why we have

745
00:36:28.912 --> 00:36:31.537
had to take this action
and I think if we do

746
00:36:31.537 --> 00:36:32.996
the right thing, we want
to

747
00:36:32.996 --> 00:36:34.662
avoid another national
lockdown and I would

748
00:36:34.662 --> 00:36:36.246
like to think that we
would

749
00:36:36.246 --> 00:36:41.246
not be in a national lockdown again
if we continue to do the right thing

750
00:36:42.246 --> 00:36:45.579
and I implore everybody, I am sure
everyone would agree here, if we all

751
00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:48.704
follow the rule of hands, face,
space, we will manage to make sure

752
00:36:48.704 --> 00:36:53.162
that the second hump does
not actually happen.

753
00:36:53.162 --> 00:36:55.829
Let’s just move off coronavirus
for a moment and take a

754
00:36:55.829 --> 00:37:00.829
question from Matthew Eaton.

755
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:03.621
Thank you.

756
00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:06.287
How has the Tories’ Brexit deal gone
from being "oven ready"

757
00:37:06.287 --> 00:37:11.246
to "a threat to our economic
and political integrity"?

758
00:37:11.621 --> 00:37:14.204
John Caudwell.

759
00:37:14.204 --> 00:37:16.121
Thank you for that.

760
00:37:16.121 --> 00:37:20.579
I don’t think that it was
first of all oven ready.

761
00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.996
How would you have described it?

762
00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:26.204
It was partially developed.

763
00:37:26.204 --> 00:37:28.912
Partially frozen?

764
00:37:28.912 --> 00:37:33.954
If you look at what Brussels
are doing, and I call them

765
00:37:33.954 --> 00:37:38.787
the Brussels bully boys,
they were taking £8 billion

766
00:37:38.787 --> 00:37:43.829
per year net off us,
they were benefiting by £80 billion

767
00:37:46.037 --> 00:37:49.579
worth of trade benefit
in trading with Britain.

768
00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:53.454
That is 80 billion better trade
for them than we were receiving.

769
00:37:53.454 --> 00:37:57.079
They were then plundering our
fishing waters and all that

770
00:37:57.079 --> 00:38:00.371
with the £8 billion.

771
00:38:00.371 --> 00:38:05.329
Now, any commercial minded
businessmen on the planet would say,

772
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:09.579
yes, we would love to do a free
trade deal with Britain.

773
00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:14.579
We would absolutely adore it!

774
00:38:16.204 --> 00:38:21.204
Because we are going to gain
80 billion worth of trade deficit

775
00:38:26.287 --> 00:38:28.746
and yet, they are bullying us
and beating us up.

776
00:38:28.746 --> 00:38:32.079
They beat Theresa May black and blue
and they have continued trying to do

777
00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:33.246
it all the way through.

778
00:38:33.246 --> 00:38:35.162
Fortunately, Boris rose
to the challenge and fought

779
00:38:35.162 --> 00:38:37.079
back and this behaviour
by Brussels I find

780
00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:41.162
absolutely abhorrent.

781
00:38:41.162 --> 00:38:41.412
L111:

782
00:38:41.412 --> 00:38:45.829
But of course the reason they are
doing it is is because they have got

783
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:48.621
doing it is is because they have got
no option, because if they gave

784
00:38:48.621 --> 00:38:50.037
no option, because if they gave
Britain an easy ride, the other

785
00:38:50.037 --> 00:38:52.621
Britain an easy ride, the other
European countries would see that

786
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:54.996
European countries would see that
and potentially they would be an

787
00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:57.162
and potentially they would be an
exodus, possibly a mass exodus,

788
00:38:57.162 --> 00:38:58.621
exodus, possibly a mass exodus,
possibly a complete collapse of the

789
00:38:58.621 --> 00:39:01.079
possibly a complete collapse of the
union and of course, that is not

790
00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:03.371
union and of course, that is not
what Brussels wants. They will use

791
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:04.037
what Bmssels wants. They will use
any means,

792
00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:04.454
what Brussels wants. They will use
any means, fair or

793
00:39:04.454 --> 00:39:06.912
what Brussels wants. They will use
any means, fair orfoul, to protect

794
00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:07.079
any means, fair or foul, to protect
their

795
00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:09.496
any means, fair orfoul, to protect
their situation and make it look to

796
00:39:09.496 --> 00:39:11.579
their situation and make it look to
any country that dares to want to

797
00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:13.454
any country that dares to want to
come out of the union, that they

798
00:39:13.454 --> 00:39:15.412
come out of the union, that they
will be crucified in the process.

799
00:39:15.412 --> 00:39:18.079
will be crucified in the process.
Look what they have done just

800
00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:21.412
Look what they have done just
recently, threatened to cut off all

801
00:39:21.412 --> 00:39:22.454
recently, threatened to cut off all
Britain’s food supplies to Northern

802
00:39:22.454 --> 00:39:27.079
Britain’s food supplies to Northern
Ireland. I mean, that is appalling!

803
00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:29.579
Ireland. I mean, that is appalling!
jon Ashworth. I

804
00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:32.037
Ireland. I mean, that is appalling!
Jon Ashworth. I mean it is curious,

805
00:39:32.037 --> 00:39:32.579
jon Ashworth. I mean it is curious,
isn’t it, because

806
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:32.829
Jon Ashworth. I mean it is curious,
isn’t it, because Boris

807
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:33.162
Jon Ashworth. I mean it is curious,
isn’t it, because BorisJohnson told

808
00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:33.787
isn’t it, because Boris johnson told
us he had

809
00:39:33.787 --> 00:39:36.662
isn’t it, because BorisJohnson told
us he had an oven ready deal, he

810
00:39:36.662 --> 00:39:37.787
us he had an oven ready deal, he
insisted on having a general

811
00:39:37.787 --> 00:39:39.621
insisted on having a general
election in order to get a mandate

812
00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:41.079
election in order to get a mandate
for his deal and his deal went

813
00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:45.371
for his deal and his deal went
through Parliament and we were lucky

814
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.329
through Partiament and we were lucky
enough to see a

815
00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:47.204
through Parliament and we were lucky
enough to see a parade of ministers

816
00:39:47.204 --> 00:39:48.662
enough to see a parade of ministers
on the television shows and in the

817
00:39:48.662 --> 00:39:49.079
on the telavision shows and in the
studio is

818
00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:50.662
on the television shows and in the
studio is telling us that Boris

819
00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:50.871
studio is telling us that Boris
johnson

820
00:39:50.871 --> 00:39:53.787
studio is telling us that Boris
Johnson had got this great deal and

821
00:39:53.787 --> 00:39:54.079
johnson had got this great deal and
we

822
00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.829
Johnson had got this great deal and
we should all celebrate, that Boris

823
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:56.121
we should all celebrate, that Boris
johnson had

824
00:39:56.121 --> 00:39:57.371
we should all celebrate, that Boris
Johnson had confounded his critics,

825
00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:57.954
johnson had confounded his critic,
as he said,

826
00:39:57.954 --> 00:39:59.621
Johnson had confounded his critics,
as he said, because it was such a

827
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:02.037
as he said, because it was such a
brilliant deal. Now, six months down

828
00:40:02.037 --> 00:40:04.204
brilliant deal. Now, six months down
the line, we are told that it isn’t

829
00:40:04.204 --> 00:40:05.871
the line, we are told that it isn’t
such a brilliant deal and it has to

830
00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:09.412
such a brilliant deal and it has to
be looked at again. Because they did

831
00:40:09.412 --> 00:40:10.454
be looked at again. Because they did
not understand, apparently, the

832
00:40:10.454 --> 00:40:14.037
not understand, apparently, the
implications of the deal at time, or

833
00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:15.871
implications of the deal at time, or
they are either lying to us at the

834
00:40:15.871 --> 00:40:18.621
they are either lying to us at the
time and now what they are doing is,

835
00:40:18.621 --> 00:40:19.579
time and now what they are doing is,
is by bringing forward these

836
00:40:19.579 --> 00:40:22.121
is by bringing forward these
particular measures in the way that

837
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:24.162
particular measures in the way that
they affect the rundown and

838
00:40:24.162 --> 00:40:24.371
they affect the mndown and
protocol,

839
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:26.037
they affect the rundown and
protocol, they are actually talking

840
00:40:26.037 --> 00:40:28.787
protocol, they are actually talking
about or admitting that they are

841
00:40:28.787 --> 00:40:30.079
about or admitting that they are
prepared to break international law!

842
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.037
prepared to break international law!
That is a quite extraordinary

843
00:40:32.037 --> 00:40:35.204
That is a quite extraordinary
position by the United Kingdom to be

844
00:40:35.204 --> 00:40:36.996
position by the United Kingdom to be
in, a country that helped create

845
00:40:36.996 --> 00:40:38.204
in, a country that helped create
international law and has always

846
00:40:38.204 --> 00:40:40.162
international law and has always
been a proud nation on the global

847
00:40:40.162 --> 00:40:42.329
been a proud nation on the global
stage, making the case for

848
00:40:42.329 --> 00:40:44.204
stage, making the case for
international law and it has left us

849
00:40:44.204 --> 00:40:48.996
international law and it has left us
in this rather sorry state and

850
00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:50.204
in this rather sorry state and
potentially the next President of

851
00:40:50.204 --> 00:40:51.162
potentially the next President of
the United States criticising us

852
00:40:51.162 --> 00:40:52.787
the United States criticising us
last night on Twitter and I think,

853
00:40:52.787 --> 00:40:55.037
last night on Twitter and I think,
why are they doing all of this? Why

854
00:40:55.037 --> 00:40:56.162
why are they doing all of this? why
are they doing

855
00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:57.162
why are they doing all of this? Why
are they doing it at this time, in

856
00:40:57.162 --> 00:40:59.912
are they doing it at this time, in
the midst of a global pandemic, we

857
00:40:59.912 --> 00:41:00.204
the midst of a global pandemic, we
ran have

858
00:41:00.204 --> 00:41:01.121
the midst of a global pandemic, we
can have disagreements about how we

859
00:41:01.121 --> 00:41:01.287
ran have disagreements about how we
should

860
00:41:01.287 --> 00:41:02.871
can have disagreements about how we
should respond to the pandemic but I

861
00:41:02.871 --> 00:41:05.329
should respond to the pandemic but I
think we can all admit that it is a

862
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.746
think we ran all admit that it is a
pretty big

863
00:41:05.746 --> 00:41:06.829
think we can all admit that it is a
pretty big issue that needs

864
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:07.787
pretty big issue that needs
undivided attention, why are they

865
00:41:07.787 --> 00:41:10.412
undivided attention, why are they
doing this now when we need to be

866
00:41:10.412 --> 00:41:12.621
doing this now when we need to be
getting on with dealing with that? A

867
00:41:12.621 --> 00:41:14.537
getting on with dealing with that? A
lot of this has been misunderstood

868
00:41:14.537 --> 00:41:15.871
lot of this has been misunderstood
about the negotiations from the

869
00:41:15.871 --> 00:41:18.912
about the negotiations from the
first day. You do not negotiate with

870
00:41:18.912 --> 00:41:21.204
first day. You do not negotiate with
your hand behind your back. We

871
00:41:21.204 --> 00:41:23.621
your hand behind your back. We
should have negotiated with Brussels

872
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:24.204
should have negotiated with Bmssels
on a tough

873
00:41:24.204 --> 00:41:25.079
should have negotiated with Brussels
on a tough line right from the

874
00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:27.829
on a tough line right from the
beginning and we would have got this

875
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:30.579
beginning and we would have got this
done. Every single factor is

876
00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:32.621
done. Every single factor is
compelling why the EU is going to do

877
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:35.204
compelling why the EU is going to do
this deal with Britain on fair

878
00:41:35.204 --> 00:41:37.871
this deal with Britain on fair
terms. The only non—compelling

879
00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:38.204
terms. The only non-compelling
factor is

880
00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:39.954
terms. The only non—compelling
factor is the possible collapse of

881
00:41:39.954 --> 00:41:41.996
factor is the possible collapse of
the EU as every country starts to

882
00:41:41.996 --> 00:41:44.579
the EU as every country starts to
think, do we really want to be part

883
00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:47.037
think, do we really want to be part
of the shambles? It is that that is

884
00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:49.496
of the shambles? It is that that is
because in the EU... Wisely you not

885
00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:51.371
because in the EU... wisely you not
doing that, is it

886
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:52.037
because in the EU... Wisely you not
doing that, is it because the UK

887
00:41:52.037 --> 00:41:57.954
doing that, is it because the UK
Government is bad at negotiating?

888
00:41:57.954 --> 00:41:58.746
Government is bad at negotiating?
The Conservative government were

889
00:41:58.746 --> 00:42:00.912
The Conservative government were
dreadful. I used to put my head in

890
00:42:00.912 --> 00:42:02.537
dreadful. I used to put my head in
my hands in horror at the way we

891
00:42:02.537 --> 00:42:05.871
my hands in horror at the way we
were negotiating in Brussels. You do

892
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:06.787
were negotiating in Bmssels. You do
not negotiate

893
00:42:06.787 --> 00:42:07.579
were negotiating in Brussels. You do
not negotiate with Belize by

894
00:42:07.579 --> 00:42:08.121
not negotiate with Belize by
rajoling

895
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:09.662
not negotiate with Belize by
cajoling them and saying, please,

896
00:42:09.662 --> 00:42:10.329
rajoling them and saying, please,
and ran you

897
00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:11.537
cajoling them and saying, please,
and can you do this? You fight

898
00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:11.746
and ran you do this? You fight
bullies

899
00:42:11.746 --> 00:42:13.287
and can you do this? You fight
bullies with the only weapon they

900
00:42:13.287 --> 00:42:15.121
bullies with the only weapon they
understand and that is force and

901
00:42:15.121 --> 00:42:17.204
understand and that is force and
that is what Boris has done. Now

902
00:42:17.204 --> 00:42:19.454
that is what Boris has done. Now
they should be doing a deal with us

903
00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:22.371
they should be doing a deal with us
and saying, yes, you can have your

904
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:24.079
and saying, yes, you can have your
international fishery waters back,

905
00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.912
international fishery waters back,
what did they say? They said you can

906
00:42:25.912 --> 00:42:26.579
what did they say? They said you ran
have your water

907
00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:27.912
what did they say? They said you can
have your water is back, but you

908
00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.121
have your water is back, but you
will never export another piece of

909
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:30.746
will never export another piece of
fish to the whole of Europe if you

910
00:42:30.746 --> 00:42:31.579
fish to the whola of Europe if you
do. It is

911
00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:33.829
fish to the whole of Europe if you
do. It is disgusting. I am sure if

912
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:34.996
do. It is disgusting. I am sure if
Michel Barnier was here and if

913
00:42:34.996 --> 00:42:36.787
Michel Barnier was here and if
you’re watching, you can come on the

914
00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:37.079
you’re watching, you ran come on the
programme, I

programme, lam sure

917
00:42:37.579 --> 00:42:38.162
you’re watching, you can come on the
programme, I am sure that they would

918
00:42:38.162 --> 00:42:40.162
programme, I am sure that they would
deny they were acting as bully boys.

919
00:42:40.162 --> 00:42:41.496
deny they were acting as bully boys.
Let us hear from

920
00:42:41.496 --> 00:42:41.954
deny they were acting as bully boys.
Let us hearfrom our audience.

Let us hear from our audience.
Nathan.

922

Let us hearfrom our audience.
Nathan. Yes. If

923
00:42:46.162 --> 00:42:46.954
Let us hearfrom our audience.
Nathan. Yes. IfI

924
00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:47.746
Let us hearfrom our audience.
Nathan. Yes. If I may ask, based on

925
00:42:47.746 --> 00:42:48.204
Nathan. Yes. IfI may ask, based on
the government

926
00:42:48.204 --> 00:42:49.162
Nathan. Yes. If I may ask, based on
the government admitting that they

927
00:42:49.162 --> 00:42:52.162
the government admitting that they
are willing to break international

928
00:42:52.162 --> 00:42:53.496
are willing to break international
law, why should they expect the rest

929
00:42:53.496 --> 00:42:55.579
law, why should they expect the rest
of us to follow the laws that they

930
00:42:55.579 --> 00:42:59.621
of us to follow the laws that they
said via Twitter, for instance, if I

931
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:02.162
said via Twitter, for instance, if I
do not wear a face mask on the

932
00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:03.204
do not wear a face mask on the
train, is that

933
00:43:03.204 --> 00:43:04.037
do not wear a face mask on the
train, is thatjust a specific and

934
00:43:04.037 --> 00:43:04.371
train, is that just a specific and
limited way

935
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:06.079
train, is thatjust a specific and
limited way of breaking the law and

936
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:07.537
limited way of breaking the law and
therefore it is OK by the

937
00:43:07.537 --> 00:43:11.537
therefore it is OK by the
government? Nile. I

938
00:43:11.537 --> 00:43:11.746
therefore it is OK by the
government? Nile. Iwanted

939
00:43:11.746 --> 00:43:12.162
therefore it is OK by the
government? Nile. I wanted to

940
00:43:12.162 --> 00:43:12.662
government? Nila. Iwanted to
clarify why

941
00:43:12.662 --> 00:43:13.996
government? Nile. I wanted to
clarify why Boris was seen as

942
00:43:13.996 --> 00:43:15.162
clarify why Boris was seen as
fighting back in Brussels when

943
00:43:15.162 --> 00:43:18.579
fighting back in Brussels when
instead he is now implementing

944
00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:19.371
instead he is now implementing
something which would involve

945
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:21.329
something which would involve
breaking international law is to

946
00:43:21.329 --> 00:43:23.787
breaking international law is to
bypass the agreement, because that

947
00:43:23.787 --> 00:43:25.746
bypass the agreement, because that
does not seem like he is winning if

948
00:43:25.746 --> 00:43:27.162
does not seem like he is winning if
he is having to fall back to

949
00:43:27.162 --> 00:43:29.954
he is having to fall back to
something that affects us breaking

950
00:43:29.954 --> 00:43:35.496
something that affects us breaking
the law. None of us here can

951
00:43:35.496 --> 00:43:35.704
the law. None of us here ran
condone...

great job of doing that. Basically
what is

964
00:43:50.412 --> 00:43:54.121
greatjob of doing that. Basically
what is quite clear is that the

965
00:43:54.121 --> 00:43:56.162
what is quite clear is that the
government, it is apparent for a no

966

government, it is apparent for a no
deal exit what it takes and blaming

really going

really going to work, I do not

really going to work, I do not
think, it is not working at the

974
00:44:05.662 --> 00:44:09.787
think, it is not working at the
moment, is it? Does anyone support

975
00:44:09.787 --> 00:44:13.037
moment, is it? Does anyone support
but the government is doing? Katie.

not support

982
00:44:19.621 --> 00:44:24.704
Katie, let us hearfrom you. I do
not support them. There are plenty

983
00:44:24.704 --> 00:44:26.412
not support them. There are plenty
of Brexiteers among you. Ian, let us

984

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:30.704

hearfrom you. I think it is more of

986
00:44:30.704 --> 00:44:31.371
hear from you. I think it is more of
an oven ready

987
00:44:31.371 --> 00:44:33.704
hearfrom you. I think it is more of
an oven ready chicken stir—fry. I

988
00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:34.079
an oven ready chicken stir-fry. I
cannot see

989
00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:35.162
an oven ready chicken stir—fry. I
cannot see the way the economy is

huge success for Boris, I pay

1006
00:44:59.996 --> 00:45:02.329
huge success for Boris, I pay
tribute to all his hard work and

1007
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:03.371
tribute to all his hard work and
congratulate him for defying the

congratulate him for defying the
odds, this is a description of the

1009
00:45:05.412 --> 00:45:06.579
odds, this is a description of the
withdrawal agreement agreed by Boris

1010
00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:07.121
withdrawal agreement agreed by Boris
johnson. He

1011
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:13.621
withdrawal agreement agreed by Boris
Johnson. He said that? Nay. I know.

1012
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:14.412
johnson. He said that? May. I know.
How has gone a

1013
00:45:14.412 --> 00:45:16.829
Johnson. He said that? Nay. I know.
How has gone a huge success to no

1014
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:20.162
How has gone a huge success to no
longer a success at all? Matt, we

1015
00:45:20.162 --> 00:45:22.621
longer a success at all? Matt, we
left the European Union with the

1016
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:24.204
left the European Union with the
withdrawal agreement and the

1017
00:45:24.204 --> 00:45:26.162
withdrawal agreement and the
Northern Irish protocol, within

1018
00:45:26.162 --> 00:45:28.079
Northern Irish protocol, within
that, especially on the Northern

1019
00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:32.371
that, especially on the Northern
Ireland Protocol, the eyes were not

1020
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:33.787
Ireland Protocol, the eyes were not
dotted and the teas were not crossed

1021
00:45:33.787 --> 00:45:35.162
dotted and the teas were not crossed
on both sides agreed that there

1022
00:45:35.162 --> 00:45:37.079
on both sides agreed that there
would be a Joint Committee to deal

1023
00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:37.662
would be a joint Committee to deal
with the

1024
00:45:37.662 --> 00:45:39.412
would be a Joint Committee to deal
with the details of that. Where we

1025
00:45:39.412 --> 00:45:41.454
with the details of that. where we
are today, we

1026
00:45:41.454 --> 00:45:44.829
with the details of that. Where we
are today, we are negotiating the

1027
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:45.829
are today, we are negotiating the
future arrangement between ourselves

1028
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:49.912
future arrangement between ourselves
and the EU and we have deliberately

1029
00:45:49.912 --> 00:45:52.496
and the EU and we have deliberately
not asked for a bespoke special unit

1030
00:45:52.496 --> 00:45:53.746
not asked for a bespoke special unit
deal because the moment you asked

1031
00:45:53.746 --> 00:45:55.162
deal because the moment you asked
for something that has never been

1032
00:45:55.162 --> 00:45:56.287
for something that has never been
written down before, the lawyers

1033
00:45:56.287 --> 00:45:56.871
written down before, the lawyers
have a field

1034
00:45:56.871 --> 00:45:57.912
written down before, the lawyers
have afield day and it will take

1035
00:45:57.912 --> 00:45:58.079
have a field day and it will take
forever

1036
00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:00.454
have afield day and it will take
forever to deliver. Lots of lawyers

1037
00:46:00.454 --> 00:46:03.787
forever to deliver. Lots of lawyers
are resigning. Let me finish this

1038
00:46:03.787 --> 00:46:06.412
are resigning. Let me finish this
point. We have asked for a day like

1039
00:46:06.412 --> 00:46:07.829
point. We have asked for a day like
Canada, something the EU have done

1040
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:11.162
Canada, something the EU have done
before, like with Japan, from the

1041
00:46:11.162 --> 00:46:11.371
before, like with japan, from the
European

1042
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:12.704
before, like with Japan, from the
European Union. We are negotiating

1043
00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:16.037
European Union. We are negotiating
in good faith, it is not about us

1044
00:46:16.037 --> 00:46:18.496
in good faith, it is not about us
actually not delivering on the

1045
00:46:18.496 --> 00:46:19.412
actually not delivering on the
withdrawal agreement and the

1046
00:46:19.412 --> 00:46:21.371
withdrawal agreement and the
Northern Irish protocol, it is about

1047
00:46:21.371 --> 00:46:23.871
Northern Irish protocol, it is about
how we deliver on those things. We

1048
00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:25.496
how we deliver on those things. We
are investing in infrastructure, you

1049
00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:25.871
are investing in infrastmclure, you
have all

1050
00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:28.912
are investing in infrastructure, you
have all heard this week about the

1051
00:46:28.912 --> 00:46:29.912
have all heard this week about the
point john

1052
00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:31.329
have all heard this week about the
pointJohn was making about food, we

1053
00:46:31.329 --> 00:46:31.912
point john was making about food, we
are investing in

1054
00:46:31.912 --> 00:46:33.996
pointJohn was making about food, we
are investing in infrastructure in

1055
00:46:33.996 --> 00:46:35.037
are investing in infrastructure in
Northern Ireland and the Northern

1056
00:46:35.037 --> 00:46:37.037
Northern Ireland and the Northern
Ireland Secretary is putting £2

1057
00:46:37.037 --> 00:46:38.037
Ireland Secretary is putting £2
billion to get Stormont back

1058
00:46:38.037 --> 00:46:40.537
billion to get Stormont back
operational because we needed to do

1059
00:46:40.537 --> 00:46:42.079
operational because we needed to do
that because of our commitment to

1060
00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.204
that because of our commitment to
the withdrawal agreement.

1061
00:46:46.246 --> 00:46:48.162
No, no, Nadhim,
that is off the point.

1062
00:46:48.162 --> 00:46:50.871
How has it gone from being
a deal that you thought

1063
00:46:50.871 --> 00:46:51.912
was a huge SUCCESS...

1064
00:46:51.912 --> 00:46:53.079
I’m about to tell you.

1065
00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:56.662
..that you went to the country with,
to one that you now want to change?

1066
00:46:56.662 --> 00:46:58.829
No, I’m confident that
we will get a deal.

1067
00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:00.079
We’re negotiating in good faith.

1068
00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:01.996
Monsieur Barnier is also
negotiating in good faith.

1069
00:47:01.996 --> 00:47:04.121
And I think both
sides can get a deal.

1070
00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.121
0K.

1071
00:47:05.121 --> 00:47:08.037
What the Prime Minister has said is,
we can’t keep negotiating forever.

1072
00:47:08.037 --> 00:47:10.954
There are still significant gaps
on fishing and on what they call

1073
00:47:10.954 --> 00:47:14.037
level playing field —
ie, state subsidy.

1074
00:47:14.037 --> 00:47:16.829
Now, we’vejust announced a deal
with Japan, a really historic deal,

1075
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:19.996
much bigger deal than we would have
had with Japan if we were

1076
00:47:19.996 --> 00:47:21.121
still part of the EU.

1077
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.246
And there, again, we have announced
how we will deal with state subsidy,

1078
00:47:24.246 --> 00:47:29.246
which should reassure our European
friends as well.

1079
00:47:30.329 --> 00:47:33.912
So, I’m confident that we will get
a deal on the future if both sides

1080
00:47:33.912 --> 00:47:35.371
negotiate hard by October the 15th.

1081
00:47:35.371 --> 00:47:37.996
Beyond which, the Prime Minister
is right to say that businesses

1082
00:47:37.996 --> 00:47:40.454
around the country —
and I’m the Business and Industry

1083
00:47:40.454 --> 00:47:41.412
Minister — need certainty.

1084
00:47:41.412 --> 00:47:44.537
So, we need to make sure that
if we can’t get a deal

1085
00:47:44.537 --> 00:47:47.496
on the terms of Canada,
we’ll go for an Australia deal and

1086
00:47:47.496 --> 00:47:48.621
we will support our businesses...

1087
00:47:48.621 --> 00:47:53.246
Which is no—deal.

1088
00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:54.412
An Australia deal means no—deal.

1089
00:47:54.412 --> 00:47:55.662
Australia are on WTO terms.

1090
00:47:55.662 --> 00:47:56.662
Yes, which is no—deal.

1091
00:47:56.662 --> 00:47:58.121
It trades with the European Union.

1092
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:03.037
I just wondered if you want
to answer Nathan’s point about...

1093
00:48:03.037 --> 00:48:04.954
Because we’ve heard the Northern
Ireland Secretary saying

1094
00:48:04.954 --> 00:48:07.537
not once, but twice —
and he should know because it’s

1095
00:48:07.537 --> 00:48:08.787
about the Northern
Ireland Protocol...

1096
00:48:08.787 --> 00:48:09.787
Yeah.

1097
00:48:09.787 --> 00:48:12.912
..that this is breaking the law
in a very specific and limited way.

1098
00:48:12.912 --> 00:48:17.287
Would you, as Nathan is suggesting,
sanction other law breaking

1099
00:48:17.287 --> 00:48:20.204
in a very specific and limited way —
say about the rule

1100
00:48:20.204 --> 00:48:21.204
of six, for example?

1101
00:48:21.204 --> 00:48:23.371
Well, the Withdrawal Agreement
does not, and the UK

1102
00:48:23.371 --> 00:48:25.079
Internal Market Bill does
not do that.

1103
00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:26.079
The clauses within it...

1104
00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:27.121
Hang on.

1105
00:48:27.121 --> 00:48:28.829
You’re saying it
doesn’t break the law?

1106
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:30.079
No, hold on a second.

1107
00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:31.996
The Attorney General has
written to the committee,

1108
00:48:31.996 --> 00:48:33.912
the Select Committees responsible,
making it very clear

1109
00:48:33.912 --> 00:48:35.079
what the legal position is.

1110
00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:36.079
No, hang on.

1111
00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.287
So, just so we’re clear.

1112
00:48:37.287 --> 00:48:38.329
Yes.

1113
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:40.496
The Northern Ireland Secretary
says it breaks the law.

1114
00:48:40.496 --> 00:48:41.537
Are you saying differently?

1115
00:48:41.537 --> 00:48:42.746
No, I’m not saying differently.

1116
00:48:42.746 --> 00:48:45.121
I’m saying to you exactly
what the Attorney General has

1117
00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:46.371
written to the Select Committees.

1118
00:48:46.371 --> 00:48:48.079
And the Northern Ireland
Secretary has said.

1119
00:48:48.079 --> 00:48:50.912
What I’m saying is that no
government can stand by and watch

1120
00:48:50.912 --> 00:48:53.537
a part of its country
and a community within its country,

1121
00:48:53.537 --> 00:48:55.204
Northern Ireland, be
harmed in any way.

1122
00:48:55.204 --> 00:48:57.871
That’s not what I’m
saying in this question.

1123
00:48:57.871 --> 00:48:59.537
These clauses, Nathan,
are an insurance policy.

1124
00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:01.704
We’ve added to them that
Parliament has to vote.

1125
00:49:01.704 --> 00:49:02.746
Parliament is sovereign.

1126
00:49:02.746 --> 00:49:05.329
Parliament have to vote
if the Government has to invoke them

1127
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:07.246
to protect the peace process
and the communities

1128
00:49:07.246 --> 00:49:08.287
of Northern Ireland.

1129
00:49:08.287 --> 00:49:10.454
Because what we can’t do,
toJohn Caudwell’s point,

1130
00:49:10.454 --> 00:49:13.371
is have a situation where an extreme
interpretation of the Northern Irish

1131
00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:15.287
protocol would actually stop us
from sending food...

1132
00:49:15.287 --> 00:49:17.662
65% of our trade with
Northern Ireland is with GB.

1133
00:49:17.662 --> 00:49:22.704
0K.

1134
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:29.787
That’s actually not what Nathan
was asking, so let me just

1135
00:49:29.787 --> 00:49:31.121
hear a bit more from...

1136
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:32.287
That’s not what Nathan’s question...

1137
00:49:32.287 --> 00:49:33.371
The peace process...

1138
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:34.537
But that wasn’t his question!

1139
00:49:34.537 --> 00:49:35.579
Yes, I...

1140
00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:38.246
I know you want to talk,
but that wasn’t his question!

1141
00:49:38.246 --> 00:49:39.287
I’m answering his question.

1142
00:49:39.287 --> 00:49:40.996
No, his question was,
very specifically, given

1143
00:49:40.996 --> 00:49:43.829
that the Government is breaking
the law in a specific and limited

1144
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:47.079
way, is it OK for everyone else?

1145
00:49:47.079 --> 00:49:49.246
I’m saying, Nathan, you can’t
extrapolate in that way

1146
00:49:49.246 --> 00:49:51.912
because you can’t watch a part
of your country he harmed

1147
00:49:51.912 --> 00:49:54.329
and the peace process be
harmed and be a bystander.

1148
00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:55.371
0K, we hearyou.

1149
00:49:55.371 --> 00:49:57.787
The reason for these clauses
are they’re an insurance policy.

1150
00:49:57.787 --> 00:50:00.829
Charlotte, let’s hear from you.

1151
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:03.996
Yeah, so the panel are talking
about breaking the law.

1152
00:50:03.996 --> 00:50:07.121
If these negotiations don’t go well,
it’ll be the case that UK law

1153
00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:10.246
enforcement loses access to really
crucial European crime systems.

1154
00:50:10.246 --> 00:50:13.371
This is a real concern for everybody
in the law enforcement community.

1155
00:50:13.371 --> 00:50:16.162
I don’t know what the panel think
about that, but the way

1156
00:50:16.162 --> 00:50:18.079
the negotiations are deteriorating,
this is looking more

1157
00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:23.121
and more likely.

1158
00:50:25.746 --> 00:50:27.121
The workarounds are
really not efficient.

1159
00:50:27.121 --> 00:50:29.287
Zainab, you had your
hand up a moment ago.

1160
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:30.371
Hi.

1161
00:50:30.371 --> 00:50:32.787
Yeah, I just want to follow
on from Nathan’s question.

1162
00:50:32.787 --> 00:50:34.954
Is it not hypocritical
that the Government is advising

1163
00:50:34.954 --> 00:50:37.329
the nation to report their neighbour
for breaking the law,

1164
00:50:37.329 --> 00:50:39.037
however, the Government
themselves intend to breach

1165
00:50:39.037 --> 00:50:40.079
the rule of law?

1166
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.079
0K.

1167
00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:42.079
Nicci...

1168
00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:43.579
I’ll come back to you, John.

1169
00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:44.787
Nicci, you’re smiling at that.

1170
00:50:44.787 --> 00:50:46.954
I am smiling at that,
and at the previous

1171
00:50:46.954 --> 00:50:47.996
question about lawbreaking.

1172
00:50:47.996 --> 00:50:51.329
I mean, the rule of six is quite
interesting because the rule of six

1173
00:50:51.329 --> 00:50:53.496
feels like it’s clear,
and then you know that

1174
00:50:53.496 --> 00:50:56.496
people are going to pubs,
going to restaurants.

1175
00:50:56.496 --> 00:50:58.162
They’re stomping around
on moors, dressed in

1176
00:50:58.162 --> 00:51:01.371
britches, shooting grouse.

1177
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:03.287
Well, Nicci, let’s come back
to Matthew’s question,

1178
00:51:03.287 --> 00:51:06.412
though, which was about...

1179
00:51:06.412 --> 00:51:08.829
Well, let’s come back to Matthew’s
question, which is about,

1180
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:11.246
"How has the Tories’ Brexit deal
gone from being oven—ready

1181
00:51:11.246 --> 00:51:13.412
to a threat to our economic
and political integrity?"

1182
00:51:13.412 --> 00:51:17.246
Those are Matt’s words.

1183
00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:20.412
My view on that is that I ardently
wanted to remain in Europe,

1184
00:51:20.412 --> 00:51:23.037
and I think I’ll be sad
until the day I die

1185
00:51:23.037 --> 00:51:25.621
that we’re leaving.

1186
00:51:25.621 --> 00:51:30.621
But I’ve completely accepted that
52% of the country voted to leave.

1187
00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:34.704
But 52% of the country did not vote
to leave in a kind of chaotic,

1188
00:51:34.704 --> 00:51:36.871
disastrous way that’s also driving
the country mad with

1189
00:51:36.871 --> 00:51:41.412
boredom, I think.

1190
00:51:41.412 --> 00:51:46.412
We seem to be locked into this
terrifyingly pedantic

1191
00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:51.454
conversation about minutiae —
which is very important,

1192
00:51:51.454 --> 00:51:54.079
but it makes most of us
lose the will to live,

1193
00:51:54.079 --> 00:51:55.121
I’d say.

1194
00:51:55.121 --> 00:51:56.996
Can I come back on that?

1195
00:51:56.996 --> 00:51:59.621
0K, let me bring Sunetra in,
she’s not talked about it.

1196
00:51:59.621 --> 00:52:01.287
I will let you come back in.

1197
00:52:01.287 --> 00:52:02.287
Sunetra.

1198
00:52:02.287 --> 00:52:03.371
What are my views?

1199
00:52:03.371 --> 00:52:05.037
Are you losing the will to live?

1200
00:52:05.037 --> 00:52:08.204
Well, I’m just thinking that
here are two shambles.

1201
00:52:08.204 --> 00:52:10.162
There’s the way this
pandemic has been dealt

1202
00:52:10.162 --> 00:52:13.871
with and there’s the way Brexit
is being, is unfolding.

1203
00:52:13.871 --> 00:52:17.912
And in both cases, I’m worried
about the economically vulnerable.

1204
00:52:17.912 --> 00:52:21.621
I think in both cases,
we need to identify...

1205
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:26.537
I agree, I don’t want to...

1206
00:52:26.537 --> 00:52:29.204
In many cases, in this case,
I don’t have the qualifications

1207
00:52:29.204 --> 00:52:32.996
to dwell on the niceties.

1208
00:52:32.996 --> 00:52:35.162
What I want to see
is that we identify

1209
00:52:35.162 --> 00:52:38.079
the vulnerable and protect them.

1210
00:52:38.079 --> 00:52:41.204
And I think that should
be ourfundamental goal.

1211
00:52:41.204 --> 00:52:44.787
And that is where we should invest.

1212
00:52:44.787 --> 00:52:47.454
Jon, you’re dying to come in.

1213
00:52:47.454 --> 00:52:50.329
Yeah, I really think the points that
Nathan and Zainab have made,

1214
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:53.662
they really are quite important.

1215
00:52:53.662 --> 00:52:58.662
And I know, you know, I have
sympathy for you as a Minister

1216
00:53:01.496 --> 00:53:03.704
because you may find them slightly
frustrating questions, but...

1217
00:53:03.704 --> 00:53:05.871
the actions of governments
and the actions of ministers

1218
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:07.246
have consequences.

1219
00:53:07.246 --> 00:53:11.912
And we’re in the midst of a crisis.

1220
00:53:11.912 --> 00:53:14.246
We’re asking the British people
to make immense sacrifices —

1221
00:53:14.246 --> 00:53:16.704
the rule of six, in Oldham,
in Leicester, now in

1222
00:53:16.704 --> 00:53:21.704
Newcastle and Sunderland,
not going into other people’s

1223
00:53:25.079 --> 00:53:27.204
houses, not seeing your family
members in private gardens.

1224
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:29.621
I think the sacrifices, I think
these restrictions are warranted.

1225
00:53:29.621 --> 00:53:31.787
Probably disagree with colleagues
here, but I agree with

1226
00:53:31.787 --> 00:53:33.954
the Government that these
restrictions are necessary to try

1227
00:53:33.954 --> 00:53:35.037
and bring infections down.

1228
00:53:35.037 --> 00:53:37.621
I think we also need to sort
out test and tracing.

1229
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:39.537
Sorry for being party
political, but it is

1230
00:53:39.537 --> 00:53:40.787
a shambles and needs fixing.

1231
00:53:40.787 --> 00:53:42.704
But at the same time,
you’re asking people

1232
00:53:42.704 --> 00:53:45.079
to follow the law —
face masks, rule of six,

1233
00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:48.121
not going into other houses —
and you’re actually completely

1234
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:53.079
admitting that you’re going to be
breaking international law.

1235
00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:58.787
So, do you not appreciate that
when we’re in a pandemic and we’re

1236
00:53:58.787 --> 00:54:01.204
asking people to follow so many
different restrictions and rules,

1237
00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:03.579
that the very least the Government
should do is follow

1238
00:54:03.579 --> 00:54:04.621
the law themselves?

1239
00:54:04.621 --> 00:54:07.246
Can I come back on this point
to Zainab and Nathan?

1240
00:54:07.246 --> 00:54:08.704
Zainab, Parliament will
make that decision.

1241
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:11.287
Parliament is sovereign.

1242
00:54:11.287 --> 00:54:14.079
Why do I say that to you?

1243
00:54:14.079 --> 00:54:16.579
Because actually, the German
Parliament, at times,

1244
00:54:16.579 --> 00:54:19.037
has actually taken votes that move
away from international agreements

1245
00:54:19.037 --> 00:54:24.079
within Europe because they deem it
unconstitutional to their country.

1246
00:54:26.454 --> 00:54:29.079
The Canadian Parliament has actually
voted on things where they’ve signed

1247
00:54:29.079 --> 00:54:31.037
international treaties,
but they’ve moved away from it

1248
00:54:31.037 --> 00:54:32.371
in domestic lawmaking.

1249
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:35.454
So, the same thing will happen
here in our Parliament.

1250
00:54:35.454 --> 00:54:37.787
We’re not saying this will happen.

1251
00:54:37.787 --> 00:54:40.621
All we’re doing is saying
we need the safeguards,

1252
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:42.787
an insurance policy,
that we can’t allow one part

1253
00:54:42.787 --> 00:54:44.954
of the United Kingdom —
Northern Ireland, the communities

1254
00:54:44.954 --> 00:54:49.246
of Northern Ireland —
to be harmed in any way by some

1255
00:54:49.246 --> 00:54:54.287
extreme interpretation
of the Northern Irish Protocol.

1256
00:54:55.787 --> 00:54:58.621
We will bring it back to Parliament,
to trigger those clauses —

1257
00:54:58.621 --> 00:55:01.246
if we need to — to protect
the unfettered access of

1258
00:55:01.246 --> 00:55:03.704
Northern Ireland to Great Britain.

1259
00:55:03.704 --> 00:55:05.371
That is already,
by the way, respected

1260
00:55:05.371 --> 00:55:06.787
in the Withdrawal Agreement.

1261
00:55:06.787 --> 00:55:09.704
So, this has precedent
internationally.

1262
00:55:09.704 --> 00:55:12.621
And I think it would be wrong
and unfair to extrapolate that

1263
00:55:12.621 --> 00:55:15.204
to breaking the rule of six
or to breaking any other

1264
00:55:15.204 --> 00:55:18.704
rules in our country.

1265
00:55:18.704 --> 00:55:21.537
So, that is all I would say
to you, Zainab and Nathan.

1266
00:55:21.537 --> 00:55:22.579
0K.

1267
00:55:22.579 --> 00:55:23.954
Peter.

1268
00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:27.412
Yeah, I don’t condone
breaking international law,

1269
00:55:27.412 --> 00:55:30.329
although states do it quite often.

1270
00:55:30.329 --> 00:55:33.912
I think a really dangerous thing
in the future, being a Brexiteer,

1271
00:55:33.912 --> 00:55:36.829
is that due to trade deals —
say, the one with Japan,

1272
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:39.954
which I think is really impressive,
I think it’s great —

1273
00:55:39.954 --> 00:55:44.954
in the future, will states be
looking to make deals with us,

1274
00:55:46.121 --> 00:55:51.121
in case they’re worried we might
renege on it or pull back?

1275
00:55:51.204 --> 00:55:52.912
And I’m saying this as a Brexiteer.

1276
00:55:52.912 --> 00:55:55.329
I just don’t think it’s
great going forward,

1277
00:55:55.329 --> 00:55:57.746
that states might think,
well, they had an agreement here,

1278
00:55:57.746 --> 00:55:59.204
they might go back with us.

1279
00:55:59.204 --> 00:56:01.121
That may sort of harm future
relations worldwide.

1280
00:56:01.121 --> 00:56:04.204
I don’t know what everyone thinks
about that, but I think it’s quite

1281
00:56:04.204 --> 00:56:06.121
an interesting view for the future.

1282
00:56:06.121 --> 00:56:09.787
But, Peter, people can see
that we are doing it in the extreme

1283
00:56:09.787 --> 00:56:11.579
case that the interpretation harms
Northern Ireland.

1284
00:56:11.579 --> 00:56:13.537
0K.

1285
00:56:13.537 --> 00:56:15.704
Nadhim, you have said that.

1286
00:56:15.704 --> 00:56:17.621
Ijust need to hear
from the audience.

1287
00:56:17.621 --> 00:56:19.704
You have said that repeatedly.

1288
00:56:19.704 --> 00:56:22.287
Japan agreed a deal with us
because they see the benefits

1289
00:56:22.287 --> 00:56:25.204
of a deal with the United Kingdom,
which I think you were

1290
00:56:25.204 --> 00:56:26.329
referring to earlier.

1291
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:28.579
Katie.

1292
00:56:28.579 --> 00:56:30.496
50, Northern towns like Oldham
are already disproportionately

1293
00:56:30.496 --> 00:56:33.121
affected by coronavirus,
and I think we’re also going to be

1294
00:56:33.121 --> 00:56:38.162
disproportionately affected
by a no—deal Brexit.

1295
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:45.871
We were on holiday in Copenhagen
last year and we were talking

1296
00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:48.704
to people there and they said,
look, we never have a

1297
00:56:48.704 --> 00:56:49.746
majority government.

1298
00:56:49.746 --> 00:56:51.662
Anytime anyone wants
to form a government here,

1299
00:56:51.662 --> 00:56:53.829
people need to sit down
and they need to

1300
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:58.787
negotiate each other.

1301
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:08.287
And they were absolutely
flabbergasted that our UK Government

1302
00:57:08.287 --> 00:57:09.954
doesn’t seem to understand
what negotiation is.

1303
00:57:09.954 --> 00:57:12.621
It’s not standing there and shouting
at the foreigners, you know?

1304
00:57:12.621 --> 00:57:15.037
You need to sit round the table
and negotiate properly.

1305
00:57:15.037 --> 00:57:16.954
Otherwise, do you know
who’s going to lose?

1306
00:57:16.954 --> 00:57:19.287
It’s not going to be
London, it’s going to be

1307
00:57:19.287 --> 00:57:20.329
Northern towns like Oldham.

1308
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:21.829
And, Matt, you asked the question.

1309
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:23.746
Erm, yeah, sorry.

1310
00:57:23.746 --> 00:57:28.746
It was just to go back
to the point of, yeah,

1311
00:57:29.454 --> 00:57:32.579
it said it was oven—ready,
but Nadhim said that Is needed to be

1312
00:57:32.579 --> 00:57:33.621
dotted and Ts crossed.

1313
00:57:33.621 --> 00:57:37.912
So, it was never oven—ready.

1314
00:57:37.912 --> 00:57:40.746
When the UK came out of the shared
customs territories,

1315
00:57:40.746 --> 00:57:43.162
it was always going to be that
Northern Ireland was

1316
00:57:43.162 --> 00:57:45.079
going to be different.

1317
00:57:45.079 --> 00:57:47.704
It is part of the UK,
but it’s the only part

1318
00:57:47.704 --> 00:57:49.621
of the UK with a [and border.

1319
00:57:49.621 --> 00:57:54.537
So, we knew that this
was going to happen.

1320
00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.954
So, it was just another example
of the Government spinning

1321
00:57:56.954 --> 00:57:58.621
and basicallyjust lying
to us again.

1322
00:57:58.621 --> 00:58:01.454
0K.

1323
00:58:01.454 --> 00:58:04.079
There’s more of you have
got your hands up and I’d

1324
00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:06.954
love to come to you,
but I’m afraid our time is up.

1325
00:58:06.954 --> 00:58:09.371
Thank you, all our questioners
from the Oldham area tonight.

1326
00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:11.037
It was great to hear from you.

1327
00:58:11.037 --> 00:58:13.454
Next week, we’ll have a virtual
audience again, of course,

1328
00:58:13.454 --> 00:58:15.079
and we will be coming from
Chingford.

1329
00:58:15.079 --> 00:58:17.829
In and around Chingford.

1330
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:20.454
And on the panel, we’ll bejoined
by comedian Shappi Khorsandi,

1331
00:58:20.454 --> 00:58:22.454
and the newly—elected leader
of the Liberal Democrats.

1332
00:58:22.454 --> 00:58:25.621
So, do get in touch with us
if you’d like to be part

1333
00:58:25.621 --> 00:58:26.662
of our virtual audience.

1334
00:58:26.662 --> 00:58:28.079
We’d love to hear from you.

1335
00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:30.954
You’re a key part of the programme,
so do get in touch.

1336
00:58:30.954 --> 00:58:33.371
And you can do that
at the Question Time website.

1337
00:58:33.371 --> 00:58:38.287
There’s an online form
and you can fill it in.

1338
00:58:38.287 --> 00:58:41.412
And then Adrian Chiles, as always,
is coming up on Radio 5 Live

1339
00:58:41.412 --> 00:58:42.579
with Question Time Extra Time.

1340
00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:50.496
You can see on the screen how
to get in touch by phone,

1341
00:58:50.496 --> 00:58:51.662
by text or by tweet.

1342
00:58:51.662 --> 00:58:54.829
But for now, thank you very much
to my panel for coming in.

1343
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:56.246
Our first show after the summer.

1344
00:58:56.246 --> 00:58:57.287
Great to get started.

1345
00:58:57.287 --> 00:58:59.204
Thank you all very
much for coming on.

1346
00:58:59.204 --> 00:59:01.871
And Nicci, of course, forjoining us
from Suffolk, I think.

1347
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:04.037
So, thank you forjoining
us down the line.

1348
00:59:04.037 --> 00:59:06.662
And of course, thank
you to you at home for watching.

1349
00:59:06.662 --> 00:59:07.704
From Question Time, bye—bye.

1350
00:59:07.704 --> 00:59:12.662
APPLAUSE

1351
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:44.662
I wash my hands
to protect my family.

1352
00:59:44.662 --> 00:59:46.829
I wear a face covering
to protect my mates.

1353
00:59:48.204 --> 00:59:50.204
I make space to protect my nan.

1354
00:59:50.204 --> 00:59:52.871
Hands. Face. Space.

1355
00:59:52.871 --> 00:59:55.371
I wash my hands to
protect my colleagues.

1356
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:58.537
I wear a face covering
to protect strangers.

1357
00:59:58.537 --> 01:00:00.871
I make space to protect you.

1358
01:00:00.871 --> 01:00:03.204
Hands. Face. Space.

1359
01:00:03.204 --> 01:00:04.912
As we spend more time indoors,

1360
01:00:04.912 --> 01:00:07.621
we need to do whatever we can
to help protect each other,

1361
01:00:07.621 --> 01:00:08.996
so please, wash hands,

1362
01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.454
cover face, make space.

1363
01:00:33.871 --> 01:00:36.996
I have called upJeremy Hunt to help
us out with this episode.

1364
01:00:36.996 --> 01:00:38.579
Hello, Jeremy.

1365
01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:41.496
Hi.

1366
01:00:41.496 --> 01:00:44.371
Now, obviously you are a former
Health Secretary, but your last big

1367
01:00:44.371 --> 01:00:46.079
job in the Cabinet was Foreign
Secretary.

1368
01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:49.204
So I thought I would combine that
with some of the news today,

1369
01:00:49.204 --> 01:00:52.079
which is that Guadalupe has been
taken off the travel corridors list,

1370
01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:54.454
so people from Guadalupe have
to quarantine when they arrive

1371
01:00:54.454 --> 01:00:55.537
in the UK.

1372
01:00:55.537 --> 01:00:58.121
So, I am going to give
you a little Guadalupe quiz,

1373
01:00:58.121 --> 01:00:59.662
as a former Foreign Secretary.

1374
01:00:59.662 --> 01:01:01.204
Go on, try me!

1375
01:01:01.204 --> 01:01:02.204
Try me.

1376
01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:03.412
It is just for fun.

1377
01:01:03.412 --> 01:01:04.496
Question one.

1378
01:01:04.496 --> 01:01:08.329
Guadalupe’s nearest neighbour
is a British territory, called...?

1379
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:09.412
Saint Lucia?

1380
01:01:09.412 --> 01:01:10.454
Montserrat.

1381
01:01:10.454 --> 01:01:12.204
Montserrat.

1382
01:01:12.204 --> 01:01:14.371
The flight to Guadalupe leaving
London tomorrow at 6:20am

1383
01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.537
via Paris takes how long?

1384
01:01:16.537 --> 01:01:21.579
Is it nine hours, 13
hours or 25 hours?

1385
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:25.162
I would guess 13 hours.

1386
01:01:25.162 --> 01:01:26.204
Correct!

1387
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.871
The prize is not a flight
or a ticket on that

1388
01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:30.079
flight, just to warn you.

1389
01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:32.454
Last question, and this
is my favourite, because it touches

1390
01:01:32.454 --> 01:01:35.204
on many of my interests,
Guadalupe uses the euro

1391
01:01:35.204 --> 01:01:38.079
and is in the customs
territory of the EU.

1392
01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:40.621
True orfalse?

1393
01:01:40.621 --> 01:01:41.662
True.

1394
01:01:41.662 --> 01:01:43.037
Correct!

1395
01:01:43.037 --> 01:01:45.371
Because it is a
department of France.

1396
01:01:45.371 --> 01:01:48.454
It looks like you used your time
in the Foreign Office very wisely

1397
01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:51.371
to just sort of read up on all sorts
of interesting places.

1398
01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:52.371
Yes.

1399
01:01:52.371 --> 01:01:55.496
I wish I had sorted Brexit
as well, but there you are.

1400
01:01:55.496 --> 01:01:58.287
Well, Jeremy, we did notjust
get you on as a former

1401
01:01:58.287 --> 01:02:01.204
Foreign Secretary, we got
you on because you are now the chair

1402
01:02:01.204 --> 01:02:03.621
of the Health Select Committee
in the House of Commons,

1403
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:06.704
which means there is lots we can
talk to you about on this

1404
01:02:06.704 --> 01:02:07.787
edition of Newscast.

1405
01:02:07.787 --> 01:02:08.829
Newscast.

1406
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:09.996
Newscast, from the BBC.

1407
01:02:14.662 --> 01:02:16.871
Hello, it is Adam in the studio.

1408
01:02:16.871 --> 01:02:20.079
And Laura in the same
studio, two metres apart.

1409
01:02:20.079 --> 01:02:21.537
And James Gallagher,
halfway across London,

1410
01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:24.079
in a completely different studio
on his own.

1411
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:25.496
James Gallagher, our health
correspondent there,

1412
01:02:25.496 --> 01:02:28.412
and we are joined by a special guest
for the whole show,

1413
01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.412
it is Jeremy Hunt.

1414
01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.454
Hello, Jeremy.

1415
01:02:30.454 --> 01:02:33.121
Hi, thank you for making me feel
like a pariah politician,

1416
01:02:33.121 --> 01:02:35.579
all in a studio, all on my own.

1417
01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:37.204
Don’t worry, that is
Chris Mason’s seat,

1418
01:02:37.204 --> 01:02:39.412
so you are in illustrious company.

1419
01:02:39.412 --> 01:02:42.079
You are also very trusting,
because you told us just before

1420
01:02:42.079 --> 01:02:44.996
we started chatting tonight that
you have never seen or listened

1421
01:02:44.996 --> 01:02:47.121
to the programme before.

1422
01:02:47.121 --> 01:02:49.412
0h, indeed.

1423
01:02:49.412 --> 01:02:53.121
I am a Newscast virgin.

1424
01:02:53.121 --> 01:02:54.412
Yes.

1425
01:02:54.412 --> 01:02:55.996
There we go.

1426
01:02:55.996 --> 01:02:57.454
Well, more of that to come.

1427
01:02:57.454 --> 01:02:58.579
Always remember your first time.

1428
01:02:58.579 --> 01:03:00.996
Now, we have got you
on because you are chair

1429
01:03:00.996 --> 01:03:03.412
of the Health Select Committee
in the House of Commons,

1430
01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.829
you are a former Foreign Secretary,
a former Health Secretary,

1431
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:08.912
so you can talk us through lots
of the things that are happening

1432
01:03:08.912 --> 01:03:12.079
and the big thing that seems to be
happening now is the test

1433
01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.662
and trace system seems to be
under a lot of strain.

1434
01:03:14.662 --> 01:03:17.287
I think everyone knows somebody
or knows somebody who knows somebody

1435
01:03:17.287 --> 01:03:19.204
who has had a problem
getting a test.

1436
01:03:19.204 --> 01:03:21.871
I think that is absolutely right
and, you know, let’s remember,

1437
01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:24.704
there was not a testing system
at the very start of this,

1438
01:03:24.704 --> 01:03:26.871
now there is a very,
very big testing system,

1439
01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:29.537
and there are lots of teething
problems with getting that sorted,

1440
01:03:29.537 --> 01:03:32.162
but it is really clear,
in the last week or so,

1441
01:03:32.162 --> 01:03:35.037
the level of stress and strain
and frustration that has been around

1442
01:03:35.037 --> 01:03:39.537
the testing system has
been absolutely intense.

1443
01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:42.412
MPs have all been completely swamped
with complaints about it,

1444
01:03:42.412 --> 01:03:44.829
we have seen the public hearing,
public frustration, people really

1445
01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:47.162
perplexed by what is going on.

1446
01:03:47.162 --> 01:03:50.079
And listen to the frustration
from Rosa, who is a nurse,

1447
01:03:50.079 --> 01:03:54.621
and, like many people,
she is waiting for a test

1448
01:03:54.621 --> 01:03:57.704
for a member of herfamily,
which means she cannot go and work,

1449
01:03:57.704 --> 01:03:59.412
in her case, in the health service.

1450
01:03:59.412 --> 01:04:03.037
I am a respiratory specialist nurse
and I work in a team of about ten

1451
01:04:03.037 --> 01:04:07.746
and we assess patients who have come
into hospital via A&E

1452
01:04:07.746 --> 01:04:11.454
or in the acute medical areas,
who have breathing difficulties.

1453
01:04:11.454 --> 01:04:15.579
And we do sometimes see Covid
patients through that.

1454
01:04:15.579 --> 01:04:19.204
At the moment, five people
in the team are off,

1455
01:04:19.204 --> 01:04:22.329
due to their children being poorly
or sent home from school or nursery

1456
01:04:22.329 --> 01:04:26.829
with a fever or a cough
and we cannot help our colleagues

1457
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.912
at hospital because we
are self isolating.

1458
01:04:29.912 --> 01:04:34.912
We cannot get swabs for our kids.

1459
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:41.121
We are trying through
the government website,

1460
01:04:41.287 --> 01:04:42.662
through health at work.

1461
01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:44.579
It has been difficult,
our colleagues are overstretched,

1462
01:04:44.579 --> 01:04:46.454
tired, busy, and we want
to help them.

1463
01:04:46.454 --> 01:04:49.871
I just think this is a catastrophic
failure, I need to be at work

1464
01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:52.162
at the moment and I am not there.

1465
01:04:52.162 --> 01:04:53.829
One of the problems
about the government’s

1466
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:56.037
handling about this is,
it has not only showed,

1467
01:04:56.037 --> 01:04:58.412
shall we say, much empathy
for people who are stuck

1468
01:04:58.412 --> 01:05:01.746
in the system and today the Leader
of the House of Commons said that

1469
