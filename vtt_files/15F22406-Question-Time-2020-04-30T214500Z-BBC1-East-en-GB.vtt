00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:16.086
how the applause makes them feel.

Good night.

there’s still some further showers
to come for this evening and

16
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.169
to come for this evening and
overnight. They will clearly ‘s so

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.502
overnight. They will dearty ‘s so
most places

18
00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:44.044
overnight. They will clearly ‘s so
most places have a dry and to the

19
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.294
most places have a dry and to the
night, although one or could linger.

20
00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:47.336

Under any clear skies are

Under any clear skies are
temperatures being brought down to

22
00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:50.627
temperatures being brought down to
around five Celsius. A little chilly

23
00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:53.086
around five Celsius. A little chilly
in one or two spots. Low pressure

24
00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.919
in one or two spots. Low pressure
still of the theme for the day

25
00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.127
still of the theme for the day
tomorrow. That will mean more

26
00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:57.377
tomorrow. That will mean more
showers, but it looks as though

27
00:00:57.377 --> 00:00:59.127
showers, but it looks as though
there will be more isolated

28
00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:02.961
there will be more isolated
tomorrow. Into the afternoon, cloud

29
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:04.002
tomorrow. Into the afternoon, cloud
building and still the possibility

30
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.711
building and still the possibility
of a heavy and shunned thunder a

31
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:07.169
of a heavy and shunned thunder a
shower somewhere.

32
00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:07.294
of a heavy and shunned thunder a
showersomewhere. Some

33
00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:09.294
of a heavy and shunned thunder a
shower somewhere. Some parts should

34
00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:11.919
shower somewhere. Some parts should
have a dry day. Temperature is

35
00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:13.502
have a dry day. Temperature is
getting to around 1A—15d, but the

36
00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:13.711
getting to around 14-1511, but the
chance

37
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:15.711
getting to around 1A—15d, but the
chance of the showers continues for

38
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:18.044
chance of the showers continues for
the afternoon and into the evening.

39
00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.836

In a moment, the national weather’s

45
00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:41.502
We might as well have had to wait
right to the end of the month before

46
00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:42.919
right to the end of the month before
we saw a decent batch of April

47
00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.627
we saw a decent batch of April
showers and it was a day that if you

48
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:46.502
showers and it was a day that if you
got a shower you did quite well

49
00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:48.086
got a shower you did quite well
because most will have seen it three

79
00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.502
dry with sunshine. Further north,
the winds are lighter and so the

80
00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:42.127

92
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:01.211
Hi! Hello!

93
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.002
I’m Dave.

94
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:05.211
You might know me as Lil Dicky.

95
00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:06.711
But there’s a lot more to me.

96
00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:08.794
Don’t you wanna know who I am?
Not really!

97
00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:10.752
Do you want to meet the guy behind
the guy? Hoo!

98
00:03:10.752 --> 00:03:13.336
Do you wanna know what the industry
is like? I got a strange life!

99
00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:16.919
# Yes I know that I’m a rapper
at the end of the day

100
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.294
# But I think it’s time you knew me
by my government name

101
00:03:20.294 --> 00:03:23.086
# I am Dave.

102
00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.002
Please. I’m Lil Dicky. Now shut up.

103
00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:29.044
# I am Dave! #

104
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:33.377
As the pandemic of coronavirus
claims more lives around the world

105
00:03:33.377 --> 00:03:36.169
the people of the United Kingdom
are now being advised

106
00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.544
to make drastic changes.

107
00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:39.711
The virus is indiscriminate.

108
00:03:39.711 --> 00:03:42.252
When things go wrong, as they
sometimes will...

109
00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:44.086
The sight of airports, unused.

110
00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:46.419
"and the road you’re trudging seems
all uphill...

111
00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.627
I think I’m too late.

112
00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.044
..and the funds are low
but the debts are high...

113
00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:53.669
..and you want to smile
but you have to sigh.

114
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.336
I didn’t take this virus seriously
until I saw this.

115
00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:59.419
Don’t give up,
though the pace seems slow.

116
00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.919
Stay in, people. Stay in at home.

117
00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.627
You may succeed with another blow.

118
00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:04.586
Here we are again, of course,
with no audience.

119
00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:07.211
Success is failure
turned inside out.

120
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:08.836
Keep it up, men,
you’re doing very well.

121
00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:11.252
The silver tint
of the clouds of doubt.

122
00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.544
You can never tell
how close you were.

123
00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:16.669
My mind is free. Ha!
I can be anywhere.

124
00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.461
It may be near, but it seems so far.

125
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.836
What is that?

126
00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:22.461
So stick to the fight
when you’re hardest hit.

127
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:25.794
It’s when things seem worst
that you must not quit.

164
00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:03.627
join in on social media. Let’s take
ourfirst question,

165
00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:03.752
join in on social media. Let’s take
our first question, which

166
00:06:03.752 --> 00:06:04.002
join in on social media. Let’s take
ourfirst question, which is

167
00:06:04.002 --> 00:06:04.252
join in on social media. Let’s take
our first question, which is from

168
00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:07.794
our first question, which is from
Hannah Robinson. Britain is set to

169
00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:10.544
Hannah Robinson. Britain is set to
have the worst death toll in Europe

170
00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:13.127
have the worst death toll in Europe
from Cobh at 19, were a decade of

171
00:06:13.127 --> 00:06:14.336
from Cobh at 19, were a decade of
austerity has left us unprepared.

172
00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:17.252
austerity has left us unprepared.
There will be an economic cost as a

173
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.961
There will be an economic cost as a
result of this crisis. How will you

174
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.752
result of this crisis. How will you
ensure it is not paid for by the

175
00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:24.044
ensure it is not paid for by the
poorest in society with further

176
00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:25.377
poorest in society with further
austerity measures? There will be a

177
00:06:25.377 --> 00:06:28.669
austerity measures? There will be a
big bill at the end of this, Grant.

178
00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.961
big bill at the end of this, Grant.
First of all, I want to caution and

179
00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:33.461
First of all, I want to caution and
looking at the figures we are all

180
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:36.336
looking at the figures we are all
aware of coming out every day, at

181
00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:37.836
aware of coming out every day, at
the press conferences, and making an

182
00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:39.586
the press conferences, and making an
assumption about where that puts us

183
00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:42.336
assumption about where that puts us
in the global league table. There

184
00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:45.377
in the global league table. There
was a good article by Professor

185
00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:45.544
was a good artida by Professor
David

186
00:06:45.544 --> 00:06:47.586
was a good article by Professor
David Siegel today in the Guardian,

187
00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:49.961
David Siegel today in the Guardian,
where he explained why you cannot do

188
00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:52.544
where he explained why you cannot do
those comparisons. Hang on a second,

189
00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.919
those comparisons. Hang on a second,
the reason Hannah is making the

190
00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.627
the reason Hannah is making the
comparison because you show the

191
00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:58.252
comparison herause you show the
graphs at the

192
00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:59.252
comparison because you show the
graphs at the press conference.

193
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.377
graphs at the press conference.
Today as yesterday it showed Britain

194
00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:02.502
Today as yesterday it showed Britain
on course, by the looks of things,

195
00:07:02.502 --> 00:07:04.127
on course, by the looks of things,
to have the worst death toll in

196
00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:08.044
to have the worst death toll in
Europe. You would know about this.

197
00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:09.627
Europe. You would know about this.
These are difficult to compare, so

198
00:07:09.627 --> 00:07:12.002
These are difficult to compare, so
we have to be careful about it. It

199
00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:13.544
we have to be careful about it. It
would be fair to say we are not

200
00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:17.627
would be fair to say we are not
doing very well. We could get into a

201
00:07:17.627 --> 00:07:19.002
doing very well. We could get into a
discussion about the statistics, but

202
00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:19.961
discussion about the statistic, but
my point is we

203
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.127
discussion about the statistics, but
my point is we need to judge it at

204
00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:23.336
my point is we need to judge it at
the end of this when we can look at

205
00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:24.127
the end of this when we ran look at
the excess

206
00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:25.919
the end of this when we can look at
the excess deaths in any given year,

207
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.794
the excess deaths in any given year,
which I think is the scientific way.

208
00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:31.169
which I think is the scientific way.
Do you accept what he is saying?

209
00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:33.794
Do you accept what he is saying?
That we are not doing very well?

210
00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:34.169
That we are not doing very well?
when you

211
00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.336
That we are not doing very well?
When you look at where we started on

212
00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:35.919
when you look at where we started on
this, it has

213
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.169
When you look at where we started on
this, it has been said at the

214
00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:41.169
this, it has been said at the
beginning that a worst—case scenario

215
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:41.711
beginning that a worst-case scenario
is half a

216
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.252
beginning that a worst—case scenario
is half a million deaths. And we

217
00:07:44.252 --> 00:07:45.711
is half a million deaths. And we
have not seen what we saw in other

218
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.377
have not seen what we saw in other
countries. We saw those pictures

219
00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:50.502
countries. We saw those pictures
which we looked at in horror where

220
00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.752
which we looked at in horror where
Italy was ahead of us and people

221
00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:55.586
Italy was ahead of us and people
were literally on the floor in

222
00:07:55.586 --> 00:07:55.669
were literally on the ﬂoor in
hospitals

223
00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:59.044
were literally on the floor in
hospitals or outside. We built eight

224
00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:01.502
hospitals or outside. We built eight
Nightingale hospitals in next to no

225
00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:04.669
Nightingale hospitals in next to no
time. Today capacity in urgent care,

226
00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:04.752
time. Today capacity in urgent rare,
critical

227
00:08:04.752 --> 00:08:07.794
time. Today capacity in urgent care,
critical care rather, is about 50%

228
00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:08.002
critical rare rather, is about 5096
availabla,

229
00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:10.169
critical care rather, is about 50%
available, and numbers in critical

230
00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:10.961
availabla, and numbers in critical
rare are falling.

231
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:12.002
available, and numbers in critical
care are falling. Lots of things

232
00:08:12.002 --> 00:08:12.836
rare are falling. Lots of things
like that,

233
00:08:12.836 --> 00:08:13.794
care are falling. Lots of things
like that, and bringing in

234
00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.586
like that, and bringing in
incubators, have gone very much a

235
00:08:15.586 --> 00:08:17.336
incubators, have gone very much a
plan thanks to the enormous efforts

236
00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:21.252
plan thanks to the enormous efforts
of everybody in the NHS and beyond.

237
00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:25.669
of everybody in the NHS and beyond.
So why are our debts so high? I

238
00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.294
So why are our debts so high? I
differ of course always to medical

239
00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:28.794
differ of course always to medical
and scientific advice and that is

240
00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:30.169
and scientific advice and that is
what the government has been doing

241
00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:33.586
what the government has been doing
all the way through. The scientific

242
00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:34.961
all the way through. The scientific
advisers are saying there are lots

243
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:40.377
advisers are saying there are lots
of reasons because of demographics,

244
00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:41.502
of reasons because of demographic,
age, obesity

245
00:08:41.502 --> 00:08:42.586
of reasons because of demographics,
age, obesity plays a part, the

246
00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:45.377
age, obesity plays a part, the
health of the population. If you

247
00:08:45.377 --> 00:08:46.627
health of the population. If you
look at, for example, the south—west

248
00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:48.794
look at, for example, the south-west
of the UK

249
00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.752
look at, for example, the south—west
of the UK and down in Cornwall, the

250
00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:52.669
of the UK and down in Cornwall, the
deaths are relatively low, whereas

251
00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:54.794
deaths are relatively low, whereas
in London at the beginning, it is a

252
00:08:54.794 --> 00:08:56.586
in London at the beginning, it is a
much more dense and compact city,

253
00:08:56.586 --> 00:08:58.752
much more dense and compact city,
they were much higher. There were a

254
00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:00.377
they were much higher. There were a
of factors, but the key factor to

255
00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:02.752
of factors, but the key factor to
look at at the end is the excess

256
00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:04.461
look at at the end is the excess
deaths over a normal year and I

257
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.127
deaths over a normal year and I
encourage people to look at the

258
00:09:06.127 --> 00:09:07.377
encourage people to look at the
article in the Guardian where the

259
00:09:07.377 --> 00:09:10.752
article in the Guardian where the
professor goes into detail. Since we

260
00:09:10.752 --> 00:09:12.752
professor goes into detail. Since we
have got you here, Sir Paul Nurse,

261
00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:15.252
have got you here, Sir Paul Nurse,
what is your view on this? This is

262
00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:18.294
what is your view on this? This is
only part of Hannah’s question. It

263
00:09:18.294 --> 00:09:21.002
only part of Hannah’s question. It
is difficult to make comparisons

264
00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:22.127
is difficult to make comparisons
between different countries, they

265
00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:24.586
between different countries, they
count deaths in different ways. We

266
00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:26.544
count deaths in different ways. We
will have to look at it in the end,

267
00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:29.211
will have to look at it in the end,
but we are right to think we could

268
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:31.127
but we are right to think we could
be doing better. There are various

269
00:09:31.127 --> 00:09:33.211
be doing better. There are various
reasons which I hope we will explore

270
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:33.461
reasons which I hope we will explore
duﬂng

271
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:34.836
reasons which I hope we will explore
during the programme. What do you

272
00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:36.544
during the programme. what do you
think they are?

273
00:09:36.544 --> 00:09:37.586
during the programme. What do you
think they are? I would start with

274
00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:39.586
think they are? I would start with
the fact that we were totally

275
00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:41.627
the fact that we were totally
unprepared for it and we should have

276
00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:43.669
unprepared for it and we should have
been prepared for it. The fact was

277
00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:46.086
been prepared for it. The fact was
there was a review of the

278
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.586
there was a review of the
functioning of the NHS, how it would

279
00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:50.627
functioning of the NHS, how it would
work in a pandemic, it happened to

280
00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:52.669
work in a pandemic, it happened to
be an influenza one, it was never

281
00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:53.044
be an inﬂuenza one, it was never
published, it

282
00:09:53.044 --> 00:09:57.586
be an influenza one, it was never
published, it was three years ago.

283
00:09:57.586 --> 00:10:00.086
published, it was three years ago.
And we didn’t do well, we failed.

284
00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:02.377
And we didn’t do well, we failed.
Was there any action? I did not see

285
00:10:02.377 --> 00:10:03.502
Was there any action? I did not see
any action, it was not even

286
00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:08.627
any action, it was not even
published. Austerity was mentioned.

287
00:10:08.627 --> 00:10:10.711
published. Austerity was mentioned.
Was the NHS well enough funded to

288
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.794
Was the NHS well enough funded to
actually take that report seriously

289
00:10:12.794 --> 00:10:16.919
actually take that report seriously
and lead when the pandemic took

290
00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.127
and lead when the pandemic took
place in a really getting on the

291
00:10:19.127 --> 00:10:21.627
place in a really getting on the
front foot? We have been playing

292
00:10:21.627 --> 00:10:24.336
front foot? We have been playing
catch up for this entire pandemic.

293
00:10:24.336 --> 00:10:25.044
catch up for this entire pandemic.
when it is

294
00:10:25.044 --> 00:10:26.211
catch up for this entire pandemic.
When it is analysed we will see that

295
00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:26.919
when it is analysed we will see that
we did

296
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.377
When it is analysed we will see that
we did not do very well. But you are

297
00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:29.752
we did not do very well. But you are
right, we have to look at the

298
00:10:29.752 --> 00:10:34.127
right, we have to look at the
figures carefully and it is still

299
00:10:34.127 --> 00:10:36.502
figures carefully and it is still
out there exactly where we will be,

300
00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.169
out there exactly where we will be,
but it is our lack of preparation

301
00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:40.127
but it is our lack of preparation
which was the start of our trouble.

302
00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:41.961
which was the start of our troubla.
I don’t

303
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:43.211
which was the start of our trouble.
I don’t want to say everything is

304
00:10:43.211 --> 00:10:44.669
I don’t want to say everything is
perfect and there is nothing we

305
00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:46.586
perfect and there is nothing we
could have done differently, don’t

306
00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:48.211
could have done differently, don’t
be ridiculous. But it is the case in

307
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:48.544
be ridiculous. But it is the use in
some of

308
00:10:48.544 --> 00:10:50.211
be ridiculous. But it is the case in
some of the best health care systems

309
00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:51.294
some of the best health rare systems
in the world,

310
00:10:51.294 --> 00:10:52.211
some of the best health care systems
in the world, Italy and Spain for

311
00:10:52.211 --> 00:10:55.669
in the world, Italy and Spain for
example, they had worse problems.

312
00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:56.919
example, they had worse problems.
The preparation that was taking

313
00:10:56.919 --> 00:11:03.794
The preparation that was taking
place for a pandemic, an ordinary

314
00:11:03.794 --> 00:11:04.002
place for a pandemic, an ordinary
inﬂuenza

315
00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:04.794
place for a pandemic, an ordinary
influenza pandemic, whereas what we

316
00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:05.336
inﬂuenza pandemic, whereas what we
have got is

317
00:11:05.336 --> 00:11:06.336
influenza pandemic, whereas what we
have got is something very global in

318
00:11:06.336 --> 00:11:08.211
have got is something very global in
nature which has led to big

319
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:08.336
nature which has lad to big
shortages

320
00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:10.586
nature which has led to big
shortages in things like PPE and the

321
00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.794
shortages in things like PPE and the
rest of it. Given all those

322
00:11:12.794 --> 00:11:14.377
rest of it. Given all those
circumstances, and we will have to

323
00:11:14.377 --> 00:11:16.961
circumstances, and we will have to
judge this at the end, but given

324
00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:19.377
judge this at the end, but given
those circumstances the way this

325
00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:20.752
those circumstances the way this
country has responded has been

326
00:11:20.752 --> 00:11:22.877
country has responded has been
remarkable and impressive in many

327
00:11:22.877 --> 00:11:23.336
remarkabla and impressive in many
ways, with

328
00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:25.919
remarkable and impressive in many
ways, with those ventilators being

329
00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.002
ways, with those ventilators being
offered up by 12,500 companies

330
00:11:27.002 --> 00:11:28.836
offered up by 12,500 companies
coming forward to see how they can

331
00:11:28.836 --> 00:11:29.502
coming forward to see how they ran
help, and a lot

332
00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:30.252
coming forward to see how they can
help, and a lot of those officers

333
00:11:30.252 --> 00:11:33.669
help, and a lot of those officers
have been taken up with Lord Dyson

334
00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:39.169
have been taken up with Lord Dyson
behind it. Please call me Paul. I

335
00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:40.669
behind it. Please call me Paul. I
think there were some very simple

336
00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:43.127
think there were some very simple
things we should have had. A

337
00:11:43.127 --> 00:11:44.877
things we should have had. A
warehouse or two full protective

338
00:11:44.877 --> 00:11:46.294
warehouse or two full protective
clothing. That would have been

339
00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:47.752
clothing. That would have been
simple to do. That was really not

340
00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:49.961
simple to do. That was really not
right. just to

341
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:51.752
simple to do. That was really not
right. Just to understand the scale

342
00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:52.294
right. just to understand the scale
of this thing,

343
00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:53.752
right. Just to understand the scale
of this thing, we probably had a

344
00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:55.836
of this thing, we probably had a
warehouse or two, but what we needed

345
00:11:55.836 --> 00:11:58.377
warehouse or two, but what we needed
was a brilliant pieces delivered.

346
00:11:58.377 --> 00:12:02.502
was a brilliant pieces delivered.
Including single gloves. Yes, but

347
00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:03.752
Including singla gloves. Yes, but
also pairs of

348
00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:04.586
Including single gloves. Yes, but
also pairs of gloves and four gloves

349
00:12:04.586 --> 00:12:09.586
also pairs of gloves and four gloves
counted as one. Let me bring in

350
00:12:09.586 --> 00:12:13.794
counted as one. Let me bring in
Anneliese. Very few people would say

351
00:12:13.794 --> 00:12:15.544
Anneliese. Very few people would say
the preparation was there to the

352
00:12:15.544 --> 00:12:17.211
the preparation was there to the
degree it should have been. But to

353
00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:19.294
degree it should have been. But to
be honest with you, I am not here to

354
00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:21.044
be honest with you, I am not here to
put blame on anyone, I am here to

355
00:12:21.044 --> 00:12:21.211
put blame on anyone, I am here to
55V

356
00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:22.586
put blame on anyone, I am here to
say what ran we

357
00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:24.252
put blame on anyone, I am here to
say what can we do to fix this? My

358
00:12:24.252 --> 00:12:25.252
say what ran we do to fix this? My
goodness, we

359
00:12:25.252 --> 00:12:26.461
say what can we do to fix this? My
goodness, we need to fix it. We need

360
00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:28.211
goodness, we need to fix it. We need
to deal with the blockages and need

361
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.961
to deal with the blockages and need
to listen to what the people on the

362
00:12:29.961 --> 00:12:32.836
to listen to what the people on the
front line are saying to us and take

363
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.461
front line are saying to us and take
action. For example, around the

364
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:37.544
action. For example, around the
enormous shortages that still exist

365
00:12:37.544 --> 00:12:39.252
enormous shortages that still exist
in protective equipment, and we saw

366
00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:43.586
in protective equipment, and we saw
that on the Panorama programme

367
00:12:43.586 --> 00:12:44.461
that on the Panorama programme
recently, there are shortages. We

368
00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:46.127
recently, there are shortages. We
set out a whole range of things that

369
00:12:46.127 --> 00:12:49.586
set out a whole range of things that
we think need to be done. Around

370
00:12:49.586 --> 00:12:51.294
we think need to be done. Around
testing we just missed the target

371
00:12:51.294 --> 00:12:52.794
testing we just missed the target
set out before. I will not

372
00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:53.252
testing we just missed the target
set out before. I will notjump up

373
00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:54.044
set out before. I will not jump up
and down

374
00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:56.044
set out before. I will notjump up
and down and say isn’t that an

375
00:12:56.044 --> 00:12:58.377
and down and say isn’t that an
incredible thing? We have to fix it.

376
00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:03.169
incredible thing? We have to fix it.
It was that 100,000 target. To be

377
00:13:03.169 --> 00:13:07.794
It was that 100,000 target. To be
clear, there is now over 90,000 test

378
00:13:07.794 --> 00:13:09.377
clear, there is now over 90,000 test
capacity. 81,500 tests were carried

379
00:13:09.377 --> 00:13:11.169
capacity. 81,500 tests were carried
out today. We will see tomorrow

380
00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:14.252
out today. We will see tomorrow
whether we have met that target.

381
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:17.127
whether we have met that target.
There are more labs coming in and

382
00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:19.294
There are more labs coming in and
the Cambridge super testing lab does

383
00:13:19.294 --> 00:13:20.752
the Cambridge super testing lab does
not open until Monday. You have got

384
00:13:20.752 --> 00:13:22.919
not open until Monday. You have got
quite a lot to say on testing, which

385
00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:25.419
quite a lot to say on testing, which
we will come to in a moment. Let’s

386
00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:28.294
we will come to in a moment. Let’s
deal with the other half of Hannah’s

387
00:13:28.294 --> 00:13:29.294
deal with the other half of Hannah’s
question. (“an

388
00:13:29.294 --> 00:13:30.169
deal with the other half of Hannah’s
question. Can you ensure the

389
00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:32.044
question. Can you ensure the
economic cost of this crisis is not

390
00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:34.211
economic cost of this crisis is not
paid for by the poorest in society

391
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:36.544
paid for by the poorest in society
with further austerity measures?

392
00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:38.794
with further austerity measures?
What Hannah highlighted in her

393
00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:38.919
what Hannah highlighted in her
question

394
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.586
What Hannah highlighted in her
question was the decision is taken

395
00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.086
question was the decision is taken
over the last ten years have left us

396
00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:45.544
over the last ten years have left us
unprepared. If you look at social

397
00:13:45.544 --> 00:13:47.627
unprepared. If you look at social
rare, we had

398
00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:49.002
unprepared. If you look at social
care, we had 120,000 vacancies in

399
00:13:49.002 --> 00:13:49.294
rare, we had 120,000 vacancies in
social rare

400
00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:50.211
care, we had 120,000 vacancies in
social care even before this crisis

401
00:13:50.211 --> 00:13:52.544
social rare even before this crisis
started.

402
00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:53.877
social care even before this crisis
started. We have been talking about

403
00:13:53.877 --> 00:13:55.586
started. We have been talking about
the decisions taken in the NHS

404
00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:57.669
the decisions taken in the NHS
because of a lack of funding. We did

405
00:13:57.669 --> 00:13:58.627
because of a lack offunding. We did
have that

406
00:13:58.627 --> 00:14:01.336
because of a lack of funding. We did
have that additional funding in the

407
00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:04.336
have that additional funding in the
20005, we did not have additional

408
00:14:04.336 --> 00:14:07.544
20005, we did not have additional
funding from 2010 onwards.

409
00:14:07.544 --> 00:14:09.752
funding from 2010 onwards.
Preparedness seemed to slip off the

410
00:14:09.752 --> 00:14:10.919
Preparedness seemed to slip off the
agenda. We cannot be in that

411
00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:13.752
agenda. We cannot be in that
situation again. Are you saying this

412
00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:15.669
situation again. Are you saying this
is partly George was my fault? He

413
00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:20.711
is partly George was my fault? He
was Chancellor. I think the

414
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:22.419
was Chancellor. I think the
statistics do make the case very

415
00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:23.086
statistis do make the use very
dearty. I

416
00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:23.294
statistis do make the use very
dearty. lam

417
00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:24.961
statistics do make the case very
clearly. I am not going to point the

418
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:25.752
dearty. I am not going to point the
finger, but we

419
00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:26.919
clearly. I am not going to point the
finger, but we had that lack of

420
00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:29.086
finger, but we had that lack of
preparedness and lack of resilience

421
00:14:29.086 --> 00:14:32.127
preparedness and lack of resilience
in our public services. But this is

422
00:14:32.127 --> 00:14:33.502
in our public services. But this is
also about households’ financial

423
00:14:33.502 --> 00:14:33.794
also about households’ financial
resilience

424
00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:37.586
also about households’ financial
resilience as well. 9% of our

425
00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:38.544
resilience as well. 996 of our
population

426
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.544
resilience as well. 9% of our
population are due to be unemployed.

427
00:14:40.544 --> 00:14:41.711
population are due to be unemployed.
We entered this crisis with a

428
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:44.961
We entered this crisis with a
quarter of families not giving

429
00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:47.169
quarter of families not giving
having £100 of savings after the

430
00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:48.169
having £100 of savings after the
longest squeeze in living standards

431
00:14:48.169 --> 00:14:50.711
longest squeeze in living standards
that our country has seen for eight

432
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:52.627
that our country has seen for eight
generations, the slowest recovery

433
00:14:52.627 --> 00:14:55.502
generations, the slowest recovery
after a financial crisis for

434
00:14:55.502 --> 00:14:57.169
after a financial crisis for
hundreds of years. That is something

435
00:14:57.169 --> 00:15:01.586
hundreds of years. That is something
that we cannot repeat. George, your

436
00:15:01.586 --> 00:15:02.086
that we cannot repeat. George, your
record is

437
00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:02.586
that we rannot repeat. George, your
record is being

438
00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:03.502
that we cannot repeat. George, your
record is being called into question

439
00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:04.252
record is being railed into question
here, and in

440
00:15:04.252 --> 00:15:05.836
record is being called into question
here, and in terms of Hannah’s

441
00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:07.586
here, and in terms of Hannah’s
question how can we ensure the cost

442
00:15:07.586 --> 00:15:08.252
question how ran we ensure the cost
of all this

443
00:15:08.252 --> 00:15:10.086
question how can we ensure the cost
of all this is not paid for by

444
00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:12.127
of all this is not paid for by
further austerity measures. Do you

445
00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:14.044
further austerity measures. Do you
think you are partly responsible for

446
00:15:14.044 --> 00:15:16.002
think you are partly responsible for
the situation the NHS is in? Then

447
00:15:16.002 --> 00:15:19.502
the situation the NHS is in? Then
how do we get out of this? There is

448
00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.336
how do we get out of this? There is
a terrible trap in the British

449
00:15:21.336 --> 00:15:22.169
a terrible trap in the British
political debate that somehow

450
00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:26.127
political debate that somehow
Britain is unique and we are either

451
00:15:26.127 --> 00:15:27.711
Britain is unique and we are either
uniquely bad or uniquely good at

452
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:32.044
uniquely bad or uniquely good at
things. In all the elements of

453
00:15:32.044 --> 00:15:33.586
things. In all the elements of
Hannah’s question Britain is

454
00:15:33.586 --> 00:15:35.127
Hannah’s question Britain is
experiencing things that other

455
00:15:35.127 --> 00:15:37.377
experiencing things that other
countries like us are experiencing.

456
00:15:37.377 --> 00:15:39.127
countries like us are experiencing.
First of all in the pandemic itself,

457
00:15:39.127 --> 00:15:41.544
First of all in the pandemic itself,
we are in the middle of the pack. We

458
00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:44.544
we are in the middle of the pack. We
are not as good as the government

459
00:15:44.544 --> 00:15:44.919
are not as good as the government
claims, dearty,

460
00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:45.336
are not as good as the government
claims, clearly, but nor

461
00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:45.502
are not as good as the government
claims, clearly, but norare

462
00:15:45.502 --> 00:15:46.711
are not as good as the government
claims, clearly, but nor are we as

463
00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:47.086
claims, dearty, but nor are we as
bad as

464
00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:49.752
claims, clearly, but nor are we as
bad as what some of the critics say.

465
00:15:49.752 --> 00:15:50.252
bad as what some of the critis say.
We have

466
00:15:50.252 --> 00:15:51.419
bad as what some of the critics say.
We have not had the testing as

467
00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:53.544
We have not had the testing as
quickly as we would have liked, we

468
00:15:53.544 --> 00:15:57.169
quickly as we would have liked, we
went into the lockdown too slowly.

469
00:15:57.169 --> 00:15:58.794
went into the lockdown too slowly.
But the hospitals have not fallen

470
00:15:58.794 --> 00:16:00.502
But the hospitals have not fallen
over and the capacity has been built

471
00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:01.544
over and the capacity has been built
and people are getting the

472
00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.836
and people are getting the
ventilators when they need them. It

473
00:16:03.836 --> 00:16:07.127
ventilators when they need them. It
is a different story in social care.

474
00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:07.586
is a different story in social rare.
Even in

475
00:16:07.586 --> 00:16:08.836
is a different story in social care.
Even in social care other countries

476
00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:09.502
Even in social rare other countries
in Europe are

477
00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:11.127
Even in social care other countries
in Europe are having terrible

478
00:16:11.127 --> 00:16:12.586
in Europe are having terrible
problems and things like protective

479
00:16:12.586 --> 00:16:14.294
problems and things like protective
equipment, Germany is doing very

480
00:16:14.294 --> 00:16:16.294
equipment, Germany is doing very
well, but the doctors are protesting

481
00:16:16.294 --> 00:16:18.086
well, but the doctors are protesting
they did not have the protective

482
00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:20.544
they did not have the protective
equipment. I think we are somewhere

483
00:16:20.544 --> 00:16:22.252
equipment. I think we are somewhere
in the middle. In terms of

484
00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:23.627
in the middle. In terms of
preparedness we were not as

485
00:16:23.627 --> 00:16:25.711
preparedness we were not as
well—prepared as we should have been

486
00:16:25.711 --> 00:16:26.294
well-prepared as we should have been
for a pandemic

487
00:16:26.294 --> 00:16:28.502
well—prepared as we should have been
for a pandemic that was not a

488
00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:29.961
for a pandemic that was not a
pandemic flu. All the contingency

489
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:30.461
pandemic ﬂu. All the contingency
planning I

490
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:33.127
pandemic flu. All the contingency
planning I saw many years ago was

491
00:16:33.127 --> 00:16:35.127
planning I saw many years ago was
about pandemic flu. That was not

492
00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.461
about pandemic ﬂu. That was not
just a bunch of

493
00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:36.919
about pandemic flu. That was not
just a bunch of politicians thinking

494
00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:39.211
just a bunch of politicians thinking
about what we had to prepare for, it

495
00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:41.794
about what we had to prepare for, it
was the expert community as well.

496
00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:42.252
was the expert community as well.
There ran

497
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.961
was the expert community as well.
There can be serious lessons, but

498
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:44.794
There ran be serious lessons, but
again no country

499
00:16:44.794 --> 00:16:45.211
There can be serious lessons, but
again no country was particularly

500
00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:46.544
again no country was particularty
well

501
00:16:46.544 --> 00:16:48.002
again no country was particularly
well prepared in the West. Finally

502
00:16:48.002 --> 00:16:50.461
well prepared in the West. Finally
on austerity, the last time I was on

503
00:16:50.461 --> 00:16:52.627
on austerity, the last time I was on
Question Time was ten years ago and

504
00:16:52.627 --> 00:16:54.669
Question Time was ten years ago and
I was the Shadow Chancellor and we

505
00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:57.002
I was the Shadow Chancellor and we
were having the same debate.

506
00:16:57.002 --> 00:16:58.044
were having the same debate.
Austerity in this country and

507
00:16:58.044 --> 00:17:00.252
Austerity in this country and
elsewhere and in every other country

508
00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:03.086
elsewhere and in every other country
was the consequence of a massive

509
00:17:03.086 --> 00:17:05.086
was the consequence of a massive
financial crash. That is what blew

510
00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:06.002
financial crash. That is what blur
the

511
00:17:06.002 --> 00:17:07.627
financial crash. That is what blew
the finances of every major economy.

512
00:17:07.627 --> 00:17:09.544
the finances of every major economy.
There is a basic truth about

513
00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:11.711
There is a basic truth about
economics which is in the end you

514
00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:11.877
economic which is in the end you
ran

515
00:17:11.877 --> 00:17:12.044
economics which is in the end you
can borrow

516
00:17:12.044 --> 00:17:12.669
economic which is in the end you
ran borrow your

517
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:13.502
economics which is in the end you
can borrow your way through the

518
00:17:13.502 --> 00:17:13.711
ran borrow your way through the
emergency,

519
00:17:13.711 --> 00:17:15.169
can borrow your way through the
emergency, but in the end if your

520
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.336
emergency, but in the end if your
country is poorer than it was, and

521
00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.752
country is poorer than it was, and
that sadly will be the case for us,

522
00:17:19.752 --> 00:17:20.252
that sadly will be the use for us,
we will

523
00:17:20.252 --> 00:17:25.752
that sadly will be the case for us,
we will have to face very questions,

524
00:17:25.752 --> 00:17:27.002
we will have to face very questions,
whether it be Anneliese or Rishi

525
00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:28.252
whether it be Anneliese or Rishi
Sunak as Chancellor, about how you

526
00:17:28.252 --> 00:17:28.836
Sunak as Chancellor, about how you
cut your doth.

527
00:17:28.836 --> 00:17:29.502
Sunak as Chancellor, about how you
cut your cloth. You can increase

528
00:17:29.502 --> 00:17:29.711
cut your doth. You ran increase
taxes

529
00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:32.502
cut your cloth. You can increase
taxes because you want to spend more

530
00:17:32.502 --> 00:17:34.336
taxes because you want to spend more
on the NHS, or you will have to keep

531
00:17:34.336 --> 00:17:36.961
on the NHS, or you will have to keep
taxes as they are and spend less.

532
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:41.502
taxes as they are and spend less.
That is just a basic rule about

533
00:17:41.502 --> 00:17:41.627
That is just a basic mla about
countrrs

534
00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.752
That is just a basic rule about
country’s finances. I faced these

535
00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:44.044
countrrs finances. I faced these
questions

536
00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:45.044
country’s finances. I faced these
questions many years ago and I

537
00:17:45.044 --> 00:17:46.752
questions many years ago and I
believe we did it in a way that kept

538
00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:49.961
believe we did it in a way that kept
people in work. In that government

539
00:17:49.961 --> 00:17:50.877
peopla in work. In that government
more jobs

540
00:17:50.877 --> 00:17:52.877
people in work. In that government
more jobs were created than any

541
00:17:52.877 --> 00:17:54.627
more jobs were created than any
government in British history. And I

542
00:17:54.627 --> 00:17:56.461
government in British history. And I
saying they were easy decisions? Am

543
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:57.961
saying they were easy decisions? Am
I saying that the poor and

544
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:00.627
I saying that the poor and
vulnerable are immune when the

545
00:18:00.627 --> 00:18:03.336
vulnerable are immune when the
economy crashes? Of course not. They

546
00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:04.919
economy crashes? Of course not. They
are often the most exposed and you

547
00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:06.252
are often the most exposed and you
have to do everything you can to

548
00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:06.669
have to do everything you ran to
help them

549
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:10.127
have to do everything you can to
help them through. But to think

550
00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:12.002
help them through. But to think
there is money when there is not is

551
00:18:12.002 --> 00:18:12.669
there is money when there is not is
a regular fault in

552
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:15.586
there is money when there is not is
a regularfault in politics. Are you

553
00:18:15.586 --> 00:18:16.586
a regular fault in politic. Are you
saying there

554
00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:17.336
a regularfault in politics. Are you
saying there will be austerity Mark

555
00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:19.502
saying there will be austerity Mark
two? I do not think it will be the

556
00:18:19.502 --> 00:18:22.086
two? I do not think it will be the
same. But the drop is deeper because

557
00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:23.044
same. But the drop is deeper because
we have shut

558
00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:23.252
same. But the drop is deeper because
we have shutdown

559
00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:24.127
same. But the drop is deeper because
we have shut down the economy. But I

560
00:18:24.127 --> 00:18:25.586
we have shut down the economy. But I
think the recovery will be more

561
00:18:25.586 --> 00:18:30.252
think the recovery will be more
quickly. Financial crises in the

562
00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:33.419
quickly. Financial crises in the
banks have been long and drawn out.

563
00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:35.211
banks have been long and drawn out.
Much of Europe was only recovering

564
00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:37.336
Much of Europe was only recovering
from the crash a couple of years ago

565
00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:40.294
from the crash a couple of years ago
that happened a decade ago. Recovery

566
00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:42.127
that happened a decade ago. Recovery
will take place more quickly, but

567
00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:44.544
will take place more quickly, but
the basic truth is our country,

568
00:18:44.544 --> 00:18:46.169
the basic truth is our country,
because of this virus, is not as

569
00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:48.544
because of this virus, is not as
rich as we thought it would be, and

570
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:49.502
rich as we thought it would he, and
a bunch of

571
00:18:49.502 --> 00:18:50.961
rich as we thought it would be, and
a bunch of people queueing up saying

572
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:53.377
a bunch of people queueing up saying
we want to pay everyone more, we

573
00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:54.877
we want to pay everyone more, we
want a universal Basic income, we

574
00:18:54.877 --> 00:18:56.711
want a universal Basic income, we
will spend more money on public

575
00:18:56.711 --> 00:18:58.919
will spend more money on public
services, I would love that to be

576
00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:00.127
services, I would love that to be
the rase, I

577
00:19:00.127 --> 00:19:01.377
services, I would love that to be
the case, I love this country, but

578
00:19:01.377 --> 00:19:01.752
the use, I love this country, but
the truth

579
00:19:01.752 --> 00:19:02.294
the rase, I love this country, but
the truth is you

580
00:19:02.294 --> 00:19:03.336
the case, I love this country, but
the truth is you have to pay for it

581
00:19:03.336 --> 00:19:04.127
the truth is you have to pay for it
and you ran be

582
00:19:04.127 --> 00:19:04.919
the truth is you have to pay for it
and you can be honest and say taxes

583
00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:06.919
and you ran be honest and say taxes
will go up, and I

584
00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:08.211
and you can be honest and say taxes
will go up, and I was the person who

585
00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:11.419
will go up, and I was the person who
put up taxes like VAT, or you say,

586
00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:14.044
put up taxes like VAT, or you say,
I’m afraid we have to cut our cloth

587
00:19:14.044 --> 00:19:14.294
I’m afraid we have to cut our doth
accordingly.

588
00:19:14.294 --> 00:19:15.627
I’m afraid we have to cut our cloth
accordingly. That debate is only

589
00:19:15.627 --> 00:19:18.086
accordingly. That debate is only
just starting in British politics.

590
00:19:18.086 --> 00:19:18.877
just starting in British politic.
It is not

591
00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:19.877
just starting in British politics.
It is not happening now because we

592
00:19:19.877 --> 00:19:23.211
It is not happening now because we
are in the middle of a pandemic. I

593
00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:24.752
are in the middle of a pandemic. I
suspect the politics of the next

594
00:19:24.752 --> 00:19:25.086
suspect the politic of the next
general

595
00:19:25.086 --> 00:19:26.127
suspect the politics of the next
general election will be all about

596
00:19:26.127 --> 00:19:29.794
general election will be all about
the economy, the economy has moved

597
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:36.252
the economy, the economy has moved
centre stage into British politics.

598
00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:41.002
You have been listening patiently in
Edinburgh, how are we going to pay

599
00:19:41.002 --> 00:19:46.461
Edinburgh, how are we going to pay
for it? Politicians, political

600
00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:52.169
for it? Politicians, political
leaders, their starting point has to

601
00:19:52.169 --> 00:19:54.336
leaders, their starting point has to
be a cause of considerable regret.

602
00:19:54.336 --> 00:19:54.627
be a cause of considerabla regret.
MY

603
00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:57.127
be a cause of considerable regret.
My second point is, I don’t think

604
00:19:57.127 --> 00:19:58.461
My second point is, I don’t think
any political leader or politician

605
00:19:58.461 --> 00:20:01.211
any political leader or politician
in Scotland or the UK should ever

606
00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:03.461
in Scotland or the UK should ever
claim that we are confident that we

607
00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:06.002
claim that we are confident that we
have got everything right so far,

608
00:20:06.002 --> 00:20:08.502
have got everything right so far,
all that we will get everything

609
00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:13.044
all that we will get everything
right. We said at the outset, this

610
00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:16.086
right. We said at the outset, this
virus is about 130 days old in terms

611
00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:18.461
virus is about 130 days old in terms
of our emerging knowledge and

612
00:20:18.461 --> 00:20:19.627
of our emerging knowledge and
understanding of it and things

613
00:20:19.627 --> 00:20:22.044
understanding of it and things
change and we have to be able to

614
00:20:22.044 --> 00:20:23.002
change and we have to be able to
change our response and our

615
00:20:23.002 --> 00:20:26.836
change our response and our
approach. There have been real

616
00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:29.419
approach. There have been real
positives in terms of how our staff

617
00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:33.002
positives in terms of how our staff
in the NHS and social care have

618
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:34.211
in the NHS and social rare have
responded in

619
00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:34.544
in the NHS and social care have
responded in creating that

620
00:20:34.544 --> 00:20:40.169
responded in creating that
significant additional capacity. Our

621
00:20:40.169 --> 00:20:42.252
significant additional capacity. Our
intensive care capacity is a quarter

622
00:20:42.252 --> 00:20:42.919
intensive rare capacity is a quarter
of what it

623
00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:46.502
intensive care capacity is a quarter
of what it is capable of. Our

624
00:20:46.502 --> 00:20:47.919
of what it is capable of. Our
caregivers have to be thanked from

625
00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:49.961
caregivers have to be thanked from
the bottom of our hearts for

626
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:52.961
the bottom of our hearts for
everything they have done and the

627
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.086
everything they have done and the
sacrifices they have made to get us

628
00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:57.544
sacrifices they have made to get us
to this place where we are

629
00:20:57.544 --> 00:20:58.627
to this place where we are
suppressing the virus. Not enough

630
00:20:58.627 --> 00:20:58.836
suppressing the vims. Not enough
vet.

631
00:20:58.836 --> 00:21:01.127
suppressing the vims. Not enough
yet, but we

632
00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:02.669
suppressing the virus. Not enough
yet, but we are suppressing it. Do

633
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:04.419
yet, but we are suppressing it. Do
you think Scotland could have taken

634
00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:08.669
you think Scotland could have taken
a different path at any stage,

635
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:10.002
a different path at any stage,
jeane? I

636
00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:10.961
a different path at any stage,
Jeane? I think Scotland’s

637
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:12.627
Jeane? I think Scotland’s
approaching this, my approach and

638
00:21:12.627 --> 00:21:15.627
approaching this, my approach and
the approach of our First Minister,

639
00:21:15.627 --> 00:21:17.502
the approach of our First Minister,
Anneliese Dodds touched on it, in

640
00:21:17.502 --> 00:21:21.627
Anneliese Dodds touched on it, in
facing a pandemic, ordinary

641
00:21:21.627 --> 00:21:24.002
facing a pandemic, ordinary
political disagreements have to be

642
00:21:24.002 --> 00:21:26.669
political disagreements have to be
put to one side. I undoubtedly have

643
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:30.044
put to one side. I undoubtedly have
significant political differences

644
00:21:30.044 --> 00:21:30.336
significant political differences
with

645
00:21:30.336 --> 00:21:31.502
significa nt political differences
with Matt

646
00:21:31.502 --> 00:21:32.419
significant political differences
with Matt Hancock, my counterpart

647
00:21:32.419 --> 00:21:36.002
with Matt Hancock, my counterpart
for the health service in England. I

648
00:21:36.002 --> 00:21:37.627
for the health service in England. I
believe in independence and he

649
00:21:37.627 --> 00:21:38.919
believe in independence and he
absolutely doesn’t. But we have to

650
00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:41.252
absolutely doesn’t. But we have to
find ways to work together because

651
00:21:41.252 --> 00:21:45.877
find ways to work together because
that is our best option for dealing

652
00:21:45.877 --> 00:21:46.877
that is our best option for dealing
with this pandemic. Notwithstanding

653
00:21:46.877 --> 00:21:49.919
with this pandemic. Notwithstanding
that we have a responsibility here

654
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.377
that we have a responsibility here
in Scotland. I do for our health

655
00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:53.794
in Scotland. I do for our health
service, but where I think the

656
00:21:53.794 --> 00:21:56.794
service, but where I think the
evidence takes me to a place where

657
00:21:56.794 --> 00:21:59.461
evidence takes me to a place where
the decision is right for the people

658
00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:01.377
the decision is right for the people
of Scotland, for the health and

659
00:22:01.377 --> 00:22:02.836
of Scotland, for the health and
social care services in Scotland

660
00:22:02.836 --> 00:22:03.252
social rare services in Scotland
would

661
00:22:03.252 --> 00:22:05.627
social care services in Scotland
would differ from any of the other

662
00:22:05.627 --> 00:22:07.794
would differ from any of the other
four nations, I clearly set that out

663
00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:08.752
four nations, I dearty set that out
because

664
00:22:08.752 --> 00:22:10.086
four nations, I clearly set that out
because that is where my

665
00:22:10.086 --> 00:22:12.919
because that is where my
responsibility lies. I think we have

666
00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:15.252
responsibility lies. I think we have
had some preparedness, we do have a

667
00:22:15.252 --> 00:22:18.419
had some preparedness, we do have a
national distribution service to

668
00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:22.086
national distribution service to
order, secure and distribute PPE. So

669
00:22:22.086 --> 00:22:23.544
order, secure and distribute PPE. So
there are differences between how

670
00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:25.919
there are differences between how
our health services run between

671
00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:26.502
our health services mn between
England, for

672
00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:29.419
our health services run between
England, for example, and Scotland.

673
00:22:29.419 --> 00:22:30.169
England, for example, and Scotland.

day, how do you see it happening? I
think Hannah has touched on an

680
00:22:39.377 --> 00:22:43.086
think Hannah has touched on an
important point. One of the key

681
00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:45.127
important point. One of the key
principles, if you like, we set out

682
00:22:45.127 --> 00:22:46.586
principles, if you like, we set out
in the document we published last

683
00:22:46.586 --> 00:22:48.419
in the document we published last
week which is really the beginning

684
00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:50.669
week which is really the beginning
of a conversation with the people of

685
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.877
of a conversation with the people of
Scotland. It sets out the framework

686
00:22:52.877 --> 00:22:55.669
Scotland. It sets out the framework
of how we will make decisions about,

687
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:58.336
of how we will make decisions about,
not only what steps what we might

688
00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:01.044
not only what steps what we might
ease coming out of the current

689
00:23:01.044 --> 00:23:04.086
ease coming out of the current
lockdown, but also how we plan ahead

690
00:23:04.086 --> 00:23:06.627
lockdown, but also how we plan ahead
for Scotland’s future to renew our

691
00:23:06.627 --> 00:23:08.419
for Scotland’s future to renew our
country, that includes our economy.

692
00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:11.419
country, that includes our economy.
But part of that is to say that

693
00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:13.336
But part of that is to say that
whilst this is a terrible situation

694
00:23:13.336 --> 00:23:16.252
whilst this is a terrible situation
and we are by no means through it

695
00:23:16.252 --> 00:23:16.419
and we are by no means through it
yet.

696
00:23:16.419 --> 00:23:18.002
and we are by no means through it
yet, we also ran

697
00:23:18.002 --> 00:23:19.836
and we are by no means through it
yet, we also can see that in that

698
00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:19.961
yet, we also ran see that in that
situation

699
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:25.044
yet, we also can see that in that
situation some things have been

700
00:23:25.044 --> 00:23:27.002
situation some things have been
thrown up, the key workers, workers

701
00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:29.586
thrown up, the key workers, workers
in the health and social care

702
00:23:29.586 --> 00:23:30.502
in the health and social rare
services,

703
00:23:30.502 --> 00:23:31.627
in the health and social care
services, delivering food, working

704
00:23:31.627 --> 00:23:32.919
services, delivering food, working
in supermarkets, keeping the basics

705
00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:33.252
in supermarkets, keeping the basis
of our

706
00:23:33.252 --> 00:23:35.377
in supermarkets, keeping the basics
of our infrastructure running are

707
00:23:35.377 --> 00:23:35.836
of our infrastmclure mnning are
actually some

708
00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:38.586
of our infrastructure running are
actually some of the worst paid

709
00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:39.211
actually some of the worst paid
peopla in

710
00:23:39.211 --> 00:23:40.752
actually some of the worst paid
people in our society. And if we are

711
00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.877
peopla in our society. And if we are
going to

712
00:23:43.877 --> 00:23:44.711
people in our society. And if we are
going to maximise the chance to

713
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:48.627
going to maximise the chance to
renew our country in Scotland, and I

714
00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:51.502
renew our country in Scotland, and I
hope in the rest of the UK, we need

715
00:23:51.502 --> 00:23:52.211
hope in the rest of the UK, we need
to take

716
00:23:52.211 --> 00:23:52.377
hope in the rest of the UK, we need
hhha

717
00:23:52.377 --> 00:23:53.419
hope in the rest of the UK, we need
to take a serious look at how we

718
00:23:53.419 --> 00:23:58.877
to take a serious look at how we
want to address any inequality of

719
00:23:58.877 --> 00:23:59.669
want to address any inequality of
income, any inequalities of

720
00:23:59.669 --> 00:24:03.044
income, any inequalities of
advantage and that does include

721
00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:04.336
advantage and that does include
looking at the practicalities of a

722
00:24:04.336 --> 00:24:06.044
looking at the practicalities of a
Universal Basic Income. In Scotland,

723
00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:08.961
Universal Basic Income. In Scotland,
we don’t have the powers that would

724
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:10.461
we don’t have the powers that would
allow us to introduce that. But it

725
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.044
allow us to introduce that. But it
will be a conversation that we will

726
00:24:12.044 --> 00:24:14.836
will be a conversation that we will
want to have. Let’s put some of that

727
00:24:14.836 --> 00:24:18.502
want to have. Let’s put some of that
to the panel. The questions about

728
00:24:18.502 --> 00:24:21.252
to the panel. The questions about
austerity, will we see a new period

729
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:23.252
austerity, will we see a new period
of austerity? The Prime Minister at

730
00:24:23.252 --> 00:24:24.877
of austerity? The Prime Minister at
the press conference today, the

731
00:24:24.877 --> 00:24:26.544
the press conference today, the
first one obviously since he has

732
00:24:26.544 --> 00:24:28.586
first one obviously since he has
been unwell. He said the economy

733
00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:30.502
been unwell. He said the economy
would bounce back strongly and then

734
00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:32.669
would bounce back strongly and then
he said I have never liked the term

735
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:35.627
he said I have never liked the term
austerity and it will be part of our

736
00:24:35.627 --> 00:24:38.252
austerity and it will be part of our
approach. Do you want to enlighten

737
00:24:38.252 --> 00:24:40.794
approach. Do you want to enlighten
us about this a bit more? The first

738
00:24:40.794 --> 00:24:44.419
us about this a bit more? The first
thing I want to say, I agree a lot

739
00:24:44.419 --> 00:24:45.627
thing I want to say, I agree a lot
with the way the devolved

740
00:24:45.627 --> 00:24:47.252
with the way the devolved
administrations have worked on this,

741
00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:48.836
administrations have worked on this,
it has been more Cross Country

742
00:24:48.836 --> 00:24:52.794
it has been more Cross Country
across party as well. I speak to my

743
00:24:52.794 --> 00:24:54.919
across party as well. I speak to my
opposite number quite frequently,

744
00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:56.169
opposite number quite frequently,
including yesterday. 0K,

745
00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:56.502
opposite number quite frequently,
including yesterday. OK, but in

746
00:24:56.502 --> 00:24:59.961
including yesterday. OK, but in
terms of what was said today? I

747
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:01.836
terms of what was said today? I
think the word you attach is the

748
00:25:01.836 --> 00:25:05.086
think the word you attach is the
important thing. Absolutely, he said

749
00:25:05.086 --> 00:25:09.794
important thing. Absolutely, he said
I have never liked that word. How

750
00:25:09.794 --> 00:25:11.669
I have never liked that word. How
you climb out of it is the

751
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:13.877
you climb out of it is the
interesting thing and the important

752
00:25:13.877 --> 00:25:16.252
interesting thing and the important
thing. As George has said, we all

753
00:25:16.252 --> 00:25:18.002
thing. As George has said, we all
know you cannot forever spend money

754
00:25:18.002 --> 00:25:19.919
know you cannot forever spend money
you have not got. On the other hand

755
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:22.336
you have not got. On the other hand
this could be more of the V shaped

756
00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:24.002
this could be more of the V shaped
recovery we hope it is, in other

757
00:25:24.002 --> 00:25:27.002
recovery we hope it is, in other
words we went into a very steeply as

758
00:25:27.002 --> 00:25:28.002
words we went into a very steeply as
the economy shut

759
00:25:28.002 --> 00:25:29.211
words we went into a very steeply as
the economy shutdown, we may open

760
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:29.336
the economy shut down, we may open
“P

761
00:25:29.336 --> 00:25:29.794
the economy shut down, we may open
up the economy

762
00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:31.294
the economy shutdown, we may open
up the economy and come out of it. I

763
00:25:31.294 --> 00:25:33.086
up the economy and come out of it. I
don’t think as a straight line going

764
00:25:33.086 --> 00:25:33.252
don’t think as a straight line going
“P

765
00:25:33.252 --> 00:25:36.294
don’t think as a straight line going
up but not as a ten year recovery

766
00:25:36.294 --> 00:25:37.502
up but not as a ten year recovery
programme. It is undeniable there

767
00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:39.461
programme. It is undeniable there
will be a new debt are formed by it.

768
00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:42.252
will be a new debt are formed by it.
I would venture to say the well’s

769
00:25:42.252 --> 00:25:42.336
I would venture to say the Hell’s
attitude

770
00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:43.711
I would venture to say the well’s
attitude towards this, because it

771
00:25:43.711 --> 00:25:46.336
attitude towards this, because it
has happened on a global basis, may

772
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:49.044
has happened on a global basis, may
be different to the financial crisis

773
00:25:49.044 --> 00:25:52.044
be different to the financial crisis
of 2008 where the problems were

774
00:25:52.044 --> 00:25:56.502
of 2008 where the problems were
banks in danger of going bust. I

775
00:25:56.502 --> 00:25:58.252
banks in danger of going bust. I
think the lending markets, the

776
00:25:58.252 --> 00:26:00.752
think the lending markets, the
global markets may now accept a

777
00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:02.877
global markets may now accept a
certain level of debts. That is an

778
00:26:02.877 --> 00:26:04.794
certain level of debts. That is an
unknown, as yet and we will have to

779
00:26:04.794 --> 00:26:06.794
unknown, as yet and we will have to
see where we are up to. We will not

780
00:26:06.794 --> 00:26:08.711
see where we are up to. We will not
know for some months to come, may be

781
00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:12.252
know for some months to come, may be
more like a year or so, who knows?

782
00:26:12.252 --> 00:26:13.794
more like a year or so, who knows?
How the economy has come back out of

783
00:26:13.794 --> 00:26:15.877
How the economy has come back out of
this and until we know that we

784
00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:16.961
this and until we know that we
cannot judge

785
00:26:16.961 --> 00:26:17.627
this and until we know that we
cannotjudge the situation. If

786
00:26:17.627 --> 00:26:18.002
cannot judge the situation. If
austerity is

787
00:26:18.002 --> 00:26:19.461
cannotjudge the situation. If
austerity is not going to be part, a

788
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:22.877
austerity is not going to be part, a
tax rise might be? What we have to

789
00:26:22.877 --> 00:26:23.294
tax rise might be? what we have to
do is

790
00:26:23.294 --> 00:26:24.502
tax rise might be? What we have to
do is consider it for what it is,

791
00:26:24.502 --> 00:26:28.127
do is consider it for what it is,
which is a crisis which, rather like

792
00:26:28.127 --> 00:26:31.211
which is a crisis which, rather like
a war, you have no choice but to pay

793
00:26:31.211 --> 00:26:32.961
a war, you have no choice but to pay
for. But as we saw after the war is

794
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:35.544
for. But as we saw after the war is
this country has gone through, the

795
00:26:35.544 --> 00:26:37.836
this country has gone through, the
last war, we came back and became a

796
00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:39.836
last war, we came back and became a
stronger country and we can do that

797
00:26:39.836 --> 00:26:40.461
stronger country and we ran do that
again. I

798
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:40.669
stronger country and we ran do that
again. Iwant

799
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:41.044
stronger country and we ran do that
again. I want to

800
00:26:41.044 --> 00:26:42.252
stronger country and we can do that
again. I want to respond to Hannah’s

801
00:26:42.252 --> 00:26:44.419
again. I want to respond to Hannah’s
original point, which is we will not

802
00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:46.836
original point, which is we will not
do the kind of, as she said,

803
00:26:46.836 --> 00:26:50.086
do the kind of, as she said,
concerned about people who are the

804
00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:51.419
concerned about people who are the
least well off. This government in

805
00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:52.294
least well off. This government in
particular were elected only in

806
00:26:52.294 --> 00:26:56.169
particular were elected only in
December on the basis of left behind

807
00:26:56.169 --> 00:26:58.377
December on the basis of left behind
communities, the town is world had

808
00:26:58.377 --> 00:27:00.419
communities, the town is world had
moved on without them and a lot of

809
00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:03.419
moved on without them and a lot of
my work to do with the Northern

810
00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:05.419
my work to do with the Northern
Powerhouse and the Cabinet with the

811
00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:07.294
Powerhouse and the Cabinet with the
levelling up agenda and we will not

812
00:27:07.294 --> 00:27:09.627
levelling up agenda and we will not
forget that. Today, I have been

813
00:27:09.627 --> 00:27:12.794
forget that. Today, I have been
working on that agenda. When we come

814
00:27:12.794 --> 00:27:14.169
working on that agenda. when we come
out of this, things

815
00:27:14.169 --> 00:27:15.252
working on that agenda. When we come
out of this, things like

816
00:27:15.252 --> 00:27:16.044
out of this, things like
reconnecting communities by

817
00:27:16.044 --> 00:27:17.211
reconnecting communities by
reversing those Beeching cuts to

818
00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:19.086
reversing those Beeching cuts to
railways and that sort of thing,

819
00:27:19.086 --> 00:27:22.044
railways and that sort of thing,
will be absolutely front and centre

820
00:27:22.044 --> 00:27:23.627
will be absolutely front and centre
of our programme. We should urge a

821
00:27:23.627 --> 00:27:25.127
of our programme. We should urge a
little caution that we are just

822
00:27:25.127 --> 00:27:26.711
little caution that we are just
going to recover that quickly. We

823
00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:31.752
going to recover that quickly. We
really don’t know how this virus is

824
00:27:31.752 --> 00:27:33.919
really don’t know how this virus is
going to behave. We hope we will

825
00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.544
going to behave. We hope we will
come out quickly, but we shouldn’t

826
00:27:35.544 --> 00:27:37.752
come out quickly, but we shouldn’t
assume that. We may have a recurring

827
00:27:37.752 --> 00:27:39.336
assume that. We may have a recurring
infection, we may be dealing with

828
00:27:39.336 --> 00:27:41.711
infection, we may be dealing with
something that takes a number of

829
00:27:41.711 --> 00:27:43.544
something that takes a number of
years. I wouldn’t,

830
00:27:43.544 --> 00:27:44.002
something that takes a number of
years. Iwouldn’t, with

831
00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:44.461
something that takes a number of
years. I wouldn’t, with complete

832
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:44.627
years. Iwouldn’t, with complete
confidence,

833
00:27:44.627 --> 00:27:45.961
years. I wouldn’t, with complete
confidence, think we will bounce

834
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:47.419
confidence, think we will bounce
back quicker than the financial

835
00:27:47.419 --> 00:27:49.502
back quicker than the financial
crisis. We have to be careful about

836
00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:52.502
crisis. We have to be careful about
that? It is clear it is going to

837
00:27:52.502 --> 00:27:54.752
that? It is clear it is going to
reshape our economy, ways of

838
00:27:54.752 --> 00:27:56.919
reshape our economy, ways of
working. This has damaged is worse

839
00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.002
working. This has damaged is worse
than the financial crisis and Keir

840
00:27:59.002 --> 00:28:02.127
than the financial crisis and Keir
Starmer talked about tax rises as a

841
00:28:02.127 --> 00:28:02.377
Starmer talked about tax rises as a
“Y

842
00:28:02.377 --> 00:28:03.419
Starmer talked about tax rises as a
way out of this? George suggested

843
00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:05.752
way out of this? George suggested
there would be two choices about how

844
00:28:05.752 --> 00:28:08.377
there would be two choices about how
much more you tax and how much less

845
00:28:08.377 --> 00:28:08.919
much more you tax and how much lass
you spend. But

846
00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:10.044
much more you tax and how much less
you spend. But there are two other

847
00:28:10.044 --> 00:28:12.377
you spend. But there are two other
big choices. One of them goes to the

848
00:28:12.377 --> 00:28:13.419
big choices. One of them goes to the
heart of what Paul

849
00:28:13.419 --> 00:28:13.919
big choices. One of them goes to the
heart of what Pauljust said which

850
00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:14.961
heart of what Paul just said which
is how

851
00:28:14.961 --> 00:28:16.336
heart of what Pauljust said which
is how we are going to boost demand

852
00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:18.752
is how we are going to boost demand
as we start to climb out of this.

853
00:28:18.752 --> 00:28:20.794
as we start to climb out of this.
Because we have seen people scaling

854
00:28:20.794 --> 00:28:22.419
Because we have seen people scaling
right back on their spending, we

855
00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:23.711
right back on their spending, we
will have to give people that

856
00:28:23.711 --> 00:28:27.336
will have to give people that
confidence again and what we saw,

857
00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:28.586
confidence again and what we saw,
unfortunately after 2010 was a

858
00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:30.461
unfortunately after 2010 was a
reduction in the confidence in many

859
00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:32.919
reduction in the confidence in many
areas, are dropping off in demand.

860
00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:35.044
areas, are dropping off in demand.
That meant the economic cake was

861
00:28:35.044 --> 00:28:35.377
That meant the economic rake was
smaller

862
00:28:35.377 --> 00:28:36.794
That meant the economic cake was
smaller than it needed to be so we

863
00:28:36.794 --> 00:28:39.836
smaller than it needed to be so we
have to make sure we have the

864
00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:41.627
have to make sure we have the
growth. Secondly, we need to take

865
00:28:41.627 --> 00:28:44.419
growth. Secondly, we need to take
decisions about where those cuts in

866
00:28:44.419 --> 00:28:48.211
decisions about where those cuts in
services or increases in tax fall.

867
00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:52.336
services or increases in tax fall.
If we look at what happened between

868
00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:54.627
If we look at what happened between
2010 and 2019, the worst of 10% of

869
00:28:54.627 --> 00:28:55.461
2010 and 2019, the worst of 101: of
peopla with

870
00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:56.044
2010 and 2019, the worst of 10% of
people with children saw their

871
00:28:56.044 --> 00:28:59.586
people with children saw their
incomes fall by 20%, according to

872
00:28:59.586 --> 00:28:59.919
incomes fall by 2096, according to
the ISS.

873
00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:03.211
incomes fall by 20%, according to
the ISS. The best of 10% of people,

874
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:04.169
the ISS. The best of 1096 of peopla,
as a

875
00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:05.002
the ISS. The best of 10% of people,
as a result of successive people,

876
00:29:05.002 --> 00:29:08.002
as a result of successive people,
they only so that falling by 2%.

877
00:29:08.002 --> 00:29:08.336
they only so that falling by 296.
There

878
00:29:08.336 --> 00:29:11.169
they only so that falling by 2%.
There was a distributional choice

879
00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:11.961
There was a distributional choice
taken by successive Conservative

880
00:29:11.961 --> 00:29:12.627
taken by successive Conservative
ministers. I am

881
00:29:12.627 --> 00:29:12.877
taken by successive Conservative
ministers. lam not

882
00:29:12.877 --> 00:29:13.794
taken by successive Conservative
ministers. I am not saying this to

883
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.294
ministers. I am not saying this to
make a party political point but we

884
00:29:15.294 --> 00:29:17.294
make a party political point but we
need a new settlement after this.

885
00:29:17.294 --> 00:29:17.794
need a new settlement after this.
Not just

886
00:29:17.794 --> 00:29:18.961
need a new settlement after this.
Notjust because those of us who

887
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:19.211
Not just because those of us who
don’t

888
00:29:19.211 --> 00:29:21.086
Notjust because those of us who
don’t like that level of inequality

889
00:29:21.086 --> 00:29:24.086
don’t like that level of inequality
and that level of deprivation, that

890
00:29:24.086 --> 00:29:25.336
and that level of deprivation, that
being morally abhorrent, but because

891
00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:27.794
being morally abhorrent, but because
it has meant we have so many people

892
00:29:27.794 --> 00:29:28.502
it has meant we have so many peopla
who are in

893
00:29:28.502 --> 00:29:32.377
it has meant we have so many people
who are in such a difficult

894
00:29:32.377 --> 00:29:34.002
who are in such a difficult
precarious financial situation now,

895
00:29:34.002 --> 00:29:35.294
precarious financial situation now,
that as they full into unemployment

896
00:29:35.294 --> 00:29:38.502
that as they full into unemployment
they don’t have the ballast. If we

897
00:29:38.502 --> 00:29:40.211
they don’t have the ballast. If we
have continued disruption, we cannot

898
00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:41.127
have continued disruption, we rannot
have that huge

899
00:29:41.127 --> 00:29:42.211
have continued disruption, we cannot
have that huge black people in the

900
00:29:42.211 --> 00:29:42.419
have that huge black peopla in the
British

901
00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:45.127
have that huge black people in the
British population who are in such a

902
00:29:45.127 --> 00:29:46.086
British population who are in such a
difficult and economic situation.

903
00:29:46.086 --> 00:29:48.752
difficult and economic situation.
Talking of people talking

904
00:29:48.752 --> 00:29:49.711
Talking of people talking
unemployment, let’s hear

905
00:29:49.711 --> 00:29:49.836
Talking of people talking
unemployment, let’s hearfrom

906
00:29:49.836 --> 00:29:50.086
unemployment, let’s hear from
another

907
00:29:50.086 --> 00:29:55.002
unemployment, let’s hearfrom
another person who contacted us. I

908
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:55.502
another person who contacted us. I
mn a

909
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.336
another person who contacted us. I
run a medium—sized brewery business

910
00:29:56.336 --> 00:29:57.377
nm a medium-sized brewery business
alongside

911
00:29:57.377 --> 00:29:58.461
run a medium—sized brewery business
alongside working in the music

912
00:29:58.461 --> 00:30:00.669
alongside working in the music
industry. Both these professions

913
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:02.669
industry. Both these professions
have been severely disrupted by the

914
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:04.794
have been severely disrupted by the
measures needed to flatten the

915
00:30:04.794 --> 00:30:07.419
measures needed to flatten the
infection curve. The current

916
00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:10.002
infection curve. The current
government backed plan to keep us

917
00:30:10.002 --> 00:30:10.169
government backed plan to keep us
aﬂoat

918
00:30:10.169 --> 00:30:14.461
government backed plan to keep us
afloat has been very welcome. When

919
00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:14.877
aﬂoat has been very welcome. when
many

920
00:30:14.877 --> 00:30:17.002
afloat has been very welcome. When
many restrictions live, help to keep

921
00:30:17.002 --> 00:30:22.419
many restrictions live, help to keep
small venues, pubs and breweries

922
00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:24.794
small venues, pubs and breweries
will be needed until they are

923
00:30:24.794 --> 00:30:25.752
will be needed until they are
profitable again? The government

924
00:30:25.752 --> 00:30:29.169
profitable again? The government
made this grand gesture of paying in

925
00:30:29.169 --> 00:30:30.794
made this grand gesture of paying in
terms of furloughed staff and it has

926
00:30:30.794 --> 00:30:32.377
terms of furloughed staff and it has
been welcome, some have fallen

927
00:30:32.377 --> 00:30:34.502
been welcome, some have fallen
through the middle and we have heard

928
00:30:34.502 --> 00:30:35.961
through the middle and we have heard
from people who are getting nothing.

929
00:30:35.961 --> 00:30:36.502
from peopla who are getting nothing.
How do you

930
00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:38.127
from people who are getting nothing.
How do you get out of that and keep

931
00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:40.002
How do you get out of that and keep
those businesses afloat is not

932
00:30:40.002 --> 00:30:43.461
those businesses afloat is not
necessarily straightforward? I

933
00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:46.002
necessarily straightforward? I
obviously take Paul’s point, we will

934
00:30:46.002 --> 00:30:47.961
obviously take Paul’s point, we will
have to live with this virus for as

935
00:30:47.961 --> 00:30:48.752
have to live with this virus for as
far as I ran

936
00:30:48.752 --> 00:30:50.044
have to live with this virus for as
far as I can see for a considerable

937
00:30:50.044 --> 00:30:51.461
far as I ran see for a considerabla
period of time

938
00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:52.752
far as I can see for a considerable
period of time until the vaccine is

939
00:30:52.752 --> 00:30:54.711
period of time until the vaccine is
discovered and then applied to the

940
00:30:54.711 --> 00:30:56.669
discovered and then applied to the
population if it is. That is going

941
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:58.836
population if it is. That is going
to require different ways of working

942
00:30:58.836 --> 00:31:00.877
to require different ways of working
and we will have to find ways for

943
00:31:00.877 --> 00:31:02.002
and we will have to find ways for
the entertainment industry and the

944
00:31:02.002 --> 00:31:03.961
the entertainment industry and the
brewing industry to get back to some

945
00:31:03.961 --> 00:31:09.169
brewing industry to get back to some
kind of life. And I think the

946
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:11.461
kind of life. And I think the
thinking this country will go back

947
00:31:11.461 --> 00:31:12.961
thinking this country will go back
to the world February 2020 is big

948
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:16.211
to the world February 2020 is big
mistake. It is going to be a new

949
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:18.961
mistake. It is going to be a new
world we live in. Some of those

950
00:31:18.961 --> 00:31:20.336
world we live in. Some of those
people who were furloughed are not

951
00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:21.377
peopla who were furloughed are not
going to have

952
00:31:21.377 --> 00:31:22.502
people who were furloughed are not
going to have jobs to go

953
00:31:22.502 --> 00:31:22.669
people who were furloughed are not
going to havejobs to go back

954
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.961
people who were furloughed are not
going to have jobs to go back to.

955
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:23.127
people who were furloughed are not
going to havejobs to go back to. I

956
00:31:23.127 --> 00:31:23.752
going to have jobs to go back to. I
have

957
00:31:23.752 --> 00:31:24.336
going to havejobs to go back to. I
have been a

958
00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:24.461
going to have jobs to go back to. I
have been a big

959
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:25.169
going to havejobs to go back to. I
have been a big supporter of what

960
00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:27.669
have been a big supporter of what
Rishi Sunak has done, to throw money

961
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:30.336
Rishi Sunak has done, to throw money
at the problem. You fix the roof as

962
00:31:30.336 --> 00:31:32.336
at the problem. You fix the roof as
the sun is shining so you can deal

963
00:31:32.336 --> 00:31:32.794
the sun is shining so you ran deal
with a

964
00:31:32.794 --> 00:31:34.211
the sun is shining so you can deal
with a storm like this. So you have

965
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:35.919
with a storm like this. So you have
the credibility as a country and the

966
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.336
the credibility as a country and the
financial markets to go and borrow.

967
00:31:38.336 --> 00:31:40.461
financial markets to go and borrow.
The government is borrowing, I

968
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:42.711
The government is borrowing, I
reckon, one in every £3 we are

969
00:31:42.711 --> 00:31:43.169
reckon, one in every B we are
spending on

970
00:31:43.169 --> 00:31:45.377
reckon, one in every £3 we are
spending on every nurse, police

971
00:31:45.377 --> 00:31:47.419
spending on every nurse, police
officer, on every furloughed person,

972
00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:49.002
officer, on every furloughed person,
on the pensions they are paying. We

973
00:31:49.002 --> 00:31:51.711
on the pensions they are paying. We
are borrowing a huge amount and we

974
00:31:51.711 --> 00:31:53.336
are borrowing a huge amount and we
need to maintain international

975
00:31:53.336 --> 00:31:54.544
need to maintain international
confidence particularly when the

976
00:31:54.544 --> 00:31:54.669
confidence particularty when the
Bank

977
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:57.502
confidence particularly when the
Bank of England stops printing money

978
00:31:57.502 --> 00:31:59.752
Bank of England stops printing money
to pay for all this, which is what

979
00:31:59.752 --> 00:32:01.336
to pay for all this, which is what
is happening at the moment. The

980
00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:03.877
is happening at the moment. The
issue of how you will allow the

981
00:32:03.877 --> 00:32:04.961
issue of how you will allow the
economy to regenerate and withdraw

982
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:07.169
economy to regenerate and withdraw
some of these schemes is going to be

983
00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:09.711
some of these schemes is going to be
very fraught and very contested in

984
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:11.544
very fraught and very contested in
British politics. I say this now as

985
00:32:11.544 --> 00:32:12.919
British politic. I say this now as
an editor

986
00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:14.419
British politics. I say this now as
an editor and an observer rather

987
00:32:14.419 --> 00:32:16.169
an editor and an observer rather
than a participant. The furlough

988
00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:17.294
than a participant. The furlough
scheme, has been a life—saver

989
00:32:17.294 --> 00:32:18.252
than a participant. The furlough
scheme, has been a life—saverfor

990
00:32:18.252 --> 00:32:18.877
scheme, has been a life-saver for
millions of

991
00:32:18.877 --> 00:32:21.002
scheme, has been a life—saverfor
millions of people and people in my

992
00:32:21.002 --> 00:32:21.336
millions of peopla and peopla in my
company have

993
00:32:21.336 --> 00:32:22.877
millions of people and people in my
company have been furloughed to save

994
00:32:22.877 --> 00:32:23.627
company have been furloughed to save
the company and their

995
00:32:23.627 --> 00:32:24.711
company have been furloughed to save
the company and theirjobs. But the

996
00:32:24.711 --> 00:32:26.711
the company and theirjobs. But the
truth is, if you let that furlough

997
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:29.961
truth is, if you let that furlough
in place for years and years, there

998
00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:31.211
in place for years and years, there
will be people who frankly were

999
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:32.211
will be people who frankly were
unemployed because they were never

1000
00:32:32.211 --> 00:32:35.294
unemployed because they were never
going to go back to a job but

1001
00:32:35.294 --> 00:32:36.711
going to go back to a job but
weren’t released into the labour

1002
00:32:36.711 --> 00:32:38.169
weren’t released into the labour
market to try and find a new

1003
00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:39.336
weren’t released into the labour
market to try and find a newjob.

1004
00:32:39.336 --> 00:32:39.919
market to try and find a new job.
That is

1005
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:42.336
market to try and find a newjob.
That is what we need to do for them

1006
00:32:42.336 --> 00:32:44.086
That is what we need to do for them
now and provide that support. But if

1007
00:32:44.086 --> 00:32:46.752
now and provide that support. But if
you allow it to carry on for ever,

1008
00:32:46.752 --> 00:32:48.711
you allow it to carry on for ever,
and I am talking not about this year

1009
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:50.669
and I am talking not about this year
but the years ahead, you have left

1010
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:53.252
but the years ahead, you have left
them in limbo. The same is true of

1011
00:32:53.252 --> 00:32:53.752
them in limbo. The same is tme of
some of

1012
00:32:53.752 --> 00:32:55.211
them in limbo. The same is true of
some of these companies that are

1013
00:32:55.211 --> 00:32:57.044
some of these companies that are
getting loans, and we all hope they

1014
00:32:57.044 --> 00:32:58.919
getting loans, and we all hope they
come back, but not all of them will.

1015
00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:01.502
come back, but not all of them will.
We have to be honest about that. We

1016
00:33:01.502 --> 00:33:03.586
We have to be honest about that. We
need to start to have the

1017
00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:05.002
need to start to have the
discussion, even though it is not an

1018
00:33:05.002 --> 00:33:08.669
discussion, even though it is not an
issue we need to confront right now.

1019
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:10.044
issue we need to confront right now.
If you keep basically, companies

1020
00:33:10.044 --> 00:33:11.502
If you keep basically, companies
that have gone bust alive with a

1021
00:33:11.502 --> 00:33:13.586
that have gone bust alive with a
credit line, you are not allowing

1022
00:33:13.586 --> 00:33:14.044
credit line, you are not allowing
the peopla

1023
00:33:14.044 --> 00:33:15.752
credit line, you are not allowing
the people involved in that company

1024
00:33:15.752 --> 00:33:17.961
the peopla involved in that company
to go off and

1025
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:18.461
the people involved in that company
to go off and do other things,

1026
00:33:18.461 --> 00:33:21.002
to go off and do other things,
create new companies and so on. It

1027
00:33:21.002 --> 00:33:23.961
create new companies and so on. It
is a very tough set of choices the

1028
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:24.752
is a very tough set of choices the
government, and indeed the

1029
00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:26.669
government, and indeed the
opposition that wants to be the

1030
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:29.127
opposition that wants to be the
government, are going to have to

1031
00:33:29.127 --> 00:33:29.961
government, are going to have to
confront. just

1032
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:30.669
government, are going to have to
confront. Just saying we have thrown

1033
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:31.711
confront. just saying we have thrown
all this money

1034
00:33:31.711 --> 00:33:33.002
confront. Just saying we have thrown
all this money at it, go on throwing

1035
00:33:33.002 --> 00:33:35.711
all this money at it, go on throwing
the money at it and go on borrowing

1036
00:33:35.711 --> 00:33:38.502
the money at it and go on borrowing
the money, is not realistic. I am

1037
00:33:38.502 --> 00:33:39.586
the money, is not realistic. I am
all for firing up

1038
00:33:39.586 --> 00:33:39.836
the money, is not realistic. I am
all forfiring up the

1039
00:33:39.836 --> 00:33:40.211
the money, is not realistic. I am
all for firing up the enterprise and

1040
00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:42.377
all for firing up the enterprise and
getting investment into the country,

1041
00:33:42.377 --> 00:33:43.919
getting investment into the country,
because the one thing I think this

1042
00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:45.127
because the one thing I think this
generation of politicians is going

1043
00:33:45.127 --> 00:33:48.252
generation of politicians is going
to have to deal with, very sadly,

1044
00:33:48.252 --> 00:33:50.544
to have to deal with, very sadly,
which my government I was part of

1045
00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:52.086
which my government I was part of
didn’t have to deal with, is

1046
00:33:52.086 --> 00:33:55.169
didn’t have to deal with, is
unemployment. That, we have not seen

1047
00:33:55.169 --> 00:33:58.377
unemployment. That, we have not seen
in this country on a large scale for

1048
00:33:58.377 --> 00:34:00.752
in this country on a large scale for
many decades. That is very scarring,

1049
00:34:00.752 --> 00:34:00.877
many decades. That is very starring,
"TY

1050
00:34:00.877 --> 00:34:01.127
many decades. That is very starring,
very damaging

1051
00:34:01.127 --> 00:34:02.294
many decades. That is very scarring,
very damaging for the people

1052
00:34:02.294 --> 00:34:03.919
very damaging for the people
involved, families and the

1053
00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:07.752
involved, families and the
communities. Really, that is another

1054
00:34:07.752 --> 00:34:11.961
communities. Really, that is another
issue that will come back

1055
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:13.252
issue that will come back
centrestage. Ultimately, you need

1056
00:34:13.252 --> 00:34:14.961
centrestage. Ultimately, you need
successful businesses that want to

1057
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:16.211
successful businesses that want to
employ people have had the capacity

1058
00:34:16.211 --> 00:34:16.669
employ peopla have had the capacity
to

1059
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:18.211
employ people have had the capacity
to employ people and they have to

1060
00:34:18.211 --> 00:34:18.294
to employ peopla and they have to
allow

1061
00:34:18.294 --> 00:34:21.377
to employ people and they have to
allow those businesses that will not

1062
00:34:21.377 --> 00:34:23.377
allow those businesses that will not
succeed, sadly, to close. You have

1063
00:34:23.377 --> 00:34:24.752
succeed, sadly, to close. You have
to allow peopla

1064
00:34:24.752 --> 00:34:25.711
succeed, sadly, to close. You have
to allow people who are furloughed,

1065
00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:26.377
to allow peopla who are furloughed,
and I am

1066
00:34:26.377 --> 00:34:27.461
to allow people who are furloughed,
and I am not talking about this

1067
00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:29.127
and I am not talking about this
year, but the years ahead, who

1068
00:34:29.127 --> 00:34:30.544
year, but the years ahead, who
furloughed and will not return to

1069
00:34:30.544 --> 00:34:32.377
furloughed and will not return to
the job they had to go and get the

1070
00:34:32.377 --> 00:34:32.502
the job they had to go and get the
new

1071
00:34:32.502 --> 00:34:34.752
the job they had to go and get the
newjob. That is going to be the

1072
00:34:34.752 --> 00:34:36.461
new job. That is going to be the
most

1073
00:34:36.461 --> 00:34:37.294
newjob. That is going to be the
most difficult decisions that these

1074
00:34:37.294 --> 00:34:39.669
most difficult decisions that these
guys are going to have to make.

1075
00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:49.002
Does the Treasury have an exit
strategy when it comes to

1076
00:34:49.002 --> 00:34:53.961
strategy when it comes to
furloughing?

1077
00:34:54.211 --> 00:34:57.461
furloughing? There is a huge amount
of uncertainty and we all understand

1078
00:34:57.461 --> 00:35:00.627
of uncertainty and we all understand
that, but we have the plans set out

1079
00:35:00.627 --> 00:35:02.627
that, but we have the plans set out
at the moment, which is the furlough

1080
00:35:02.627 --> 00:35:03.086
at the moment, which is the furlough
continues until

1081
00:35:03.086 --> 00:35:07.127
at the moment, which is the furlough
continues untilJune. Are you

1082
00:35:07.127 --> 00:35:07.627
continues until june. Are you
looking at

1083
00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:12.252
continues untilJune. Are you
looking at extending that? Wait

1084
00:35:12.252 --> 00:35:13.627
looking at extending that? Wait
until we see what happens at the

1085
00:35:13.627 --> 00:35:17.877
until we see what happens at the
time. It will be extended, there is

1086
00:35:17.877 --> 00:35:22.252
time. It will be extended, there is
no way it will be coming to an end.

1087
00:35:22.252 --> 00:35:24.169
no way it will be coming to an end.
It is an expensive scheme. This

1088
00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:25.544
It is an expensive scheme. This
depends largely on ourselves and how

1089
00:35:25.544 --> 00:35:28.002
depends largely on ourselves and how
we deal with the lockdown and

1090
00:35:28.002 --> 00:35:30.586
we deal with the lockdown and
keeping to these social distancing

1091
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:32.127
keeping to these social distancing
measures as we go forward. What we

1092
00:35:32.127 --> 00:35:33.002
measures as we go forward. what we
do not

1093
00:35:33.002 --> 00:35:36.211
measures as we go forward. What we
do not know is how the Oxford

1094
00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:38.252
do not know is how the Oxford
University tie—up with AstraZeneca

1095
00:35:38.252 --> 00:35:38.627
University tie-up with AstraZenera
that we

1096
00:35:38.627 --> 00:35:41.086
University tie—up with AstraZeneca
that we learnt about today is going

1097
00:35:41.086 --> 00:35:43.502
that we learnt about today is going
to do, if indeed the Tesco well, on

1098
00:35:43.502 --> 00:35:44.669
to do, if indeed the Tesco well, on
the vaccine. That could be a

1099
00:35:44.669 --> 00:35:47.669
the vaccine. That could be a
complete game changer. That is going

1100
00:35:47.669 --> 00:35:53.211
complete game changer. That is going
to be some time off. When it comes

1101
00:35:53.211 --> 00:35:53.586
to be some time off. when it comes
to the

1102
00:35:53.586 --> 00:35:54.669
to be some time off. When it comes
to the hospitality industry in

1103
00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:55.794
to the hospitality industry in
particular, how will they begin to

1104
00:35:55.794 --> 00:35:59.211
particular, how will they begin to
get back on their feet? George is

1105
00:35:59.211 --> 00:36:01.919
get back on their feet? George is
right, there has been a huge amount

1106
00:36:01.919 --> 00:36:05.836
right, there has been a huge amount
of initial assistance, £25,000

1107
00:36:05.836 --> 00:36:06.836
of initial assistance, £25,000
grants, not loans, provided to

1108
00:36:06.836 --> 00:36:08.627
grants, not loans, provided to
businesses at the stage and they are

1109
00:36:08.627 --> 00:36:10.752
businesses at the stage and they are
not paying any business rates. Half

1110
00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:12.336
not paying any business rates. Half
the businesses in Britain will not

1111
00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:14.419
the businesses in Britain will not
be paying business rates, including

1112
00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:17.336
be paying business rates, including
hospitality, this year. We cannot

1113
00:36:17.336 --> 00:36:18.836
hospitality, this year. We rannot
put the tart

1114
00:36:18.836 --> 00:36:19.794
hospitality, this year. We cannot
put the cart before the horse. First

1115
00:36:19.794 --> 00:36:20.836
put the tart before the horse. First
of all we

1116
00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:21.669
put the cart before the horse. First
of all we have to see the

1117
00:36:21.669 --> 00:36:24.127
of all we have to see the
all—important art rate, which we

1118
00:36:24.127 --> 00:36:24.669
all-important art rate, which we
will be hearing

1119
00:36:24.669 --> 00:36:27.711
all—important art rate, which we
will be hearing much more about,

1120
00:36:27.711 --> 00:36:31.002
will be hearing much more about,
come down. We know it is between 0.6

1121
00:36:31.002 --> 00:36:33.919
come down. We know it is between 0.6
and 0.9 and that will enable us

1122
00:36:33.919 --> 00:36:35.794
and 0.9 and that will enabla us
through the

1123
00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:37.502
and 0.9 and that will enable us
through the plan released next week

1124
00:36:37.502 --> 00:36:38.544
through the plan released next week
to tweak social distancing, and

1125
00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.836
to tweak social distancing, and
there are many different aspects to

1126
00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:42.377
there are many different aspects to
this. Cleariy

1127
00:36:42.377 --> 00:36:43.919
there are many different aspects to
this. Clearly you do not go straight

1128
00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:44.086
this. Cleariy you do not go straight
from

1129
00:36:44.086 --> 00:36:46.419
this. Clearly you do not go straight
from where we are today to pubs and

1130
00:36:46.419 --> 00:36:47.669
from where we are today to pubs and
clubs being open and that problem

1131
00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:47.794
dubs being open and that problem
being

1132
00:36:47.794 --> 00:36:50.211
clubs being open and that problem
being resolved. Will you help keep

1133
00:36:50.211 --> 00:36:53.794
being resolved. will you help keep
pubs and

1134
00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:55.627
being resolved. Will you help keep
pubs and breweries alive? We want to

1135
00:36:55.627 --> 00:36:57.252
pubs and breweries alive? We want to
try and keep the economy intact so

1136
00:36:57.252 --> 00:36:58.794
try and keep the economy intact so
if we are able to defeat this thing

1137
00:36:58.794 --> 00:37:01.044
if we are able to defeat this thing
quickly that they are still there.

1138
00:37:01.044 --> 00:37:01.169
quickly that they are still there.
What

1139
00:37:01.169 --> 00:37:01.377
quickly that they are still there.
what you

1140
00:37:01.377 --> 00:37:05.127
quickly that they are still there.
What you are inviting me to do is

1141
00:37:05.127 --> 00:37:05.502
what you are inviting me to do is
guess. just

1142
00:37:05.502 --> 00:37:08.211
What you are inviting me to do is
guess. Just answer the question.

1143
00:37:08.211 --> 00:37:08.544
guess. just answer the question.
Nobody ran

1144
00:37:08.544 --> 00:37:09.836
guess. Just answer the question.
Nobody can see the future of the

1145
00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:10.377
Nobody ran see the future of the
virus in

1146
00:37:10.377 --> 00:37:12.252
Nobody can see the future of the
virus in the same way you or I did

1147
00:37:12.252 --> 00:37:14.419
virus in the same way you or I did
not see it coming in the first

1148
00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:15.336
not see it coming in the first
place. Another question from John

1149
00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:18.627
place. Another question from John
Chadwick. If the government does not

1150
00:37:18.627 --> 00:37:22.169
Chadwick. If the government does not
know who is carrying the virus in

1151
00:37:22.169 --> 00:37:23.377
know who is carrying the virus in
our communities, how does the

1152
00:37:23.377 --> 00:37:25.461
our communities, how does the
government know where and when to

1153
00:37:25.461 --> 00:37:31.044
government know where and when to
lift restrictions on movement? Paul?

1154
00:37:31.044 --> 00:37:33.044
lift restrictions on movement? Paul?
This is a very critical point. The

1155
00:37:33.044 --> 00:37:35.669
This is a very critical point. The
only tool we have in our armoury at

1156
00:37:35.669 --> 00:37:39.086
only tool we have in our armoury at
this moment is testing, testing,

1157
00:37:39.086 --> 00:37:40.669
this moment is testing, testing,
testing, and the appropriate changes

1158
00:37:40.669 --> 00:37:42.086
testing, and the appropriate changes
in how society works which is built

1159
00:37:42.086 --> 00:37:46.336
in how society works which is built
on that. Critical to the nation’s

1160
00:37:46.336 --> 00:37:49.627
on that. Critical to the nation’s
response to the pandemic is testing.

1161
00:37:49.627 --> 00:37:52.461
response to the pandemic is testing.
Was it put in place properly? Was it

1162
00:37:52.461 --> 00:37:53.169
Was it put in place property? Was it
put in place

1163
00:37:53.169 --> 00:37:55.711
Was it put in place properly? Was it
put in place rapidly enough? What is

1164
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:56.502
put in place rapidly enough? what is
your answer to

1165
00:37:56.502 --> 00:38:00.461
put in place rapidly enough? What is
your answer to that? My answer is I

1166
00:38:00.461 --> 00:38:02.252
your answer to that? My answer is I
think we certainly could have done

1167
00:38:02.252 --> 00:38:03.669
think we certainly could have done
better. We were not prepared for it,

1168
00:38:03.669 --> 00:38:07.461
better. We were not prepared for it,
as I said. Policy that was followed,

1169
00:38:07.461 --> 00:38:09.586
as I said. Policy that was followed,
a mixture of political and

1170
00:38:09.586 --> 00:38:11.252
a mixture of political and
scientific and medical advice

1171
00:38:11.252 --> 00:38:13.961
scientific and medical advice
working together, decided to invest

1172
00:38:13.961 --> 00:38:17.211
working together, decided to invest
in large mega labs and these labs

1173
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.211
in large mega labs and these labs
will be absolutely essential, but

1174
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:20.252
will be absolutely essential, but
because we did not have the

1175
00:38:20.252 --> 00:38:22.211
because we did not have the
preparation it takes a lot of effort

1176
00:38:22.211 --> 00:38:24.252
preparation it takes a lot of effort
to get them to work. It is not

1177
00:38:24.252 --> 00:38:26.419
to get them to work. It is not
simply putting the lab there, there

1178
00:38:26.419 --> 00:38:28.169
simply putting the lab there, there
is the workﬂow, getting the

1179
00:38:28.169 --> 00:38:29.752
is the workﬂow, getting the
samples, getting them

1180
00:38:29.752 --> 00:38:30.586
is the workflow, getting the
samples, getting them collected,

1181
00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:33.211
samples, getting them collected,
getting the IT working, getting the

1182
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:35.086
getting the IT working, getting the
results back in appropriate time.

1183
00:38:35.086 --> 00:38:36.836
results back in appropriate time.
Anybody could have seen that that

1184
00:38:36.836 --> 00:38:39.002
Anybody could have seen that that
would be a difficult thing to do.

1185
00:38:39.002 --> 00:38:41.211
would be a difficult thing to do.
The proper decision should have

1186
00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:44.002
The proper decision should have
been, yes, to get the mega labs in

1187
00:38:44.002 --> 00:38:46.211
been, yes, to get the mega labs in
place, but to encourage as many

1188
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:49.169
place, but to encourage as many
other places, such as the Francis

1189
00:38:49.169 --> 00:38:50.627
other places, such as the Francis
Crick Institute, which did respond,

1190
00:38:50.627 --> 00:38:53.252
Crick Institute, which did respond,
where you could do local testing.

1191
00:38:53.252 --> 00:38:53.419
where you could do [oral testing.
That

1192
00:38:53.419 --> 00:38:54.752
where you could do local testing.
That was critical particularly in

1193
00:38:54.752 --> 00:38:54.877
That was critical particularty in
the

1194
00:38:54.877 --> 00:38:57.044
That was critical particularly in
the health care worker sector. How

1195
00:38:57.044 --> 00:38:57.252
the health rare worker sector. How
much

1196
00:38:57.252 --> 00:39:03.211
the health care worker sector. How
much difference do you think will

1197
00:39:03.211 --> 00:39:06.586
much difference do you think will
this 100,000 target make? 100,000 is

1198
00:39:06.586 --> 00:39:08.377
this 100,000 target make? 100,000 is
a number with a lot of notes in it.

1199
00:39:08.377 --> 00:39:12.252
a number with a lot of notes in it.
It was a PR stunt that has gone a

1200
00:39:12.252 --> 00:39:15.002
It was a PR stunt that has gone a
bit wrong. 100,000, why

1201
00:39:15.002 --> 00:39:15.711
It was a PR stunt that has gone a
bit wrong. 100,000, why100,000?

1202
00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:16.377
bit wrong. 100,000, why100,000?
where is

1203
00:39:16.377 --> 00:39:17.919
bit wrong. 100,000, why100,000?
Where is the strategy in that? It

1204
00:39:17.919 --> 00:39:18.419
where is the strategy in that? It
just sounded

1205
00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:22.252
Where is the strategy in that? It
just sounded good. Yesterday it was

1206
00:39:22.252 --> 00:39:25.586
just sounded good. Yesterday it was
50,000, but we should not get hung

1207
00:39:25.586 --> 00:39:25.794
50,000, but we should not get hung
“P

1208
00:39:25.794 --> 00:39:27.419
50,000, but we should not get hung
up on that. The real reality is

1209
00:39:27.419 --> 00:39:30.752
up on that. The real reality is
this. If we had had local testing,

1210
00:39:30.752 --> 00:39:32.669
this. If we had had local testing,
connected to local hospitals, we

1211
00:39:32.669 --> 00:39:32.877
connected to [oral hospitals, we
could

1212
00:39:32.877 --> 00:39:35.127
connected to local hospitals, we
could have made hospitals a safe

1213
00:39:35.127 --> 00:39:35.461
could have made hospitals a safe
place. what

1214
00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:40.336
could have made hospitals a safe
place. What we had is the potential

1215
00:39:40.336 --> 00:39:40.961
place. what we had is the potential
for having rare

1216
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:41.586
place. What we had is the potential
for having care workers working on

1217
00:39:41.586 --> 00:39:43.586
for having rare workers working on
the wards,

1218
00:39:43.586 --> 00:39:44.877
for having care workers working on
the wards, working with six

1219
00:39:44.877 --> 00:39:46.002
the wards, working with six
patients, who were carrying the

1220
00:39:46.002 --> 00:39:47.211
patients, who were carrying the
disease and who were not being

1221
00:39:47.211 --> 00:39:50.627
disease and who were not being
tested. We heard Matt Hancock say a

1222
00:39:50.627 --> 00:39:53.419
tested. We heard Matt Hancock say a
couple of weeks ago that we have got

1223
00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:54.669
couple of weeks ago that we have got
the capacity, but the NHS workers

1224
00:39:54.669 --> 00:39:58.127
the capacity, but the NHS workers
are not coming forward. Do you

1225
00:39:58.127 --> 00:40:00.586
are not coming forward. Do you
remember that? Why were they not

1226
00:40:00.586 --> 00:40:00.794
remember that? why were they not
coming

1227
00:40:00.794 --> 00:40:01.627
remember that? Why were they not
coming forward? Because the NHS

1228
00:40:01.627 --> 00:40:01.836
coming forward? Because the NHS
mles

1229
00:40:01.836 --> 00:40:04.377
coming forward? Because the NHS
rules would not let them. What do

1230
00:40:04.377 --> 00:40:07.044
mles would not let them. what do
you mean?

1231
00:40:07.044 --> 00:40:07.836
rules would not let them. What do
you mean? They had such restrictive

1232
00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:08.252
you mean? They had such restrictive
mles on

1233
00:40:08.252 --> 00:40:11.377
you mean? They had such restrictive
rules on who could be tested, they

1234
00:40:11.377 --> 00:40:11.919
mles on who could be tested, they
did not

1235
00:40:11.919 --> 00:40:13.252
rules on who could be tested, they
did not make the decision to test

1236
00:40:13.252 --> 00:40:15.002
did not make the decision to test
everybody who was a front line

1237
00:40:15.002 --> 00:40:16.586
everybody who was a front line
worker. In particular they would not

1238
00:40:16.586 --> 00:40:20.169
worker. In particular they would not
test anybody who had no symptoms. We

1239
00:40:20.169 --> 00:40:21.669
test anybody who had no symptoms. We
know with this disease you can be

1240
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:21.836
know with this disease you ran be
infected

1241
00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:24.377
know with this disease you can be
infected and have no symptoms. This

1242
00:40:24.377 --> 00:40:27.586
infected and have no symptoms. This
makes absolutely no sense. We were

1243
00:40:27.586 --> 00:40:31.294
makes absolutely no sense. We were
allowing potentially for front line

1244
00:40:31.294 --> 00:40:31.586
allowing potentially for front line
rare

1245
00:40:31.586 --> 00:40:32.919
allowing potentially for front line
care workers to be on the wards

1246
00:40:32.919 --> 00:40:33.461
rare workers to be on the wards
potentially

1247
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:34.294
care workers to be on the wards
potentially infecting people because

1248
00:40:34.294 --> 00:40:36.836
potentially infecting people because
we were not testing. That may have

1249
00:40:36.836 --> 00:40:39.461
we were not testing. That may have
been because they did not have

1250
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:40.961
been because they did not have
testing capacity throughout the

1251
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:42.836
testing capacity throughout the
country, but you cannot say we do

1252
00:40:42.836 --> 00:40:45.544
country, but you cannot say we do
not need to do it because we do not

1253
00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:48.044
not need to do it because we do not
have testing capacity. Even when we

1254
00:40:48.044 --> 00:40:49.461
have testing capacity. Even when we
could provide testing capacity, we

1255
00:40:49.461 --> 00:40:52.502
could provide testing capacity, we
could not do it because of the NHS

1256
00:40:52.502 --> 00:40:53.752
could not do it because of the NHS
mles. Testing

1257
00:40:53.752 --> 00:40:54.544
could not do it because of the NHS
rules. Testing was critical, it has

1258
00:40:54.544 --> 00:40:56.211
mles. Testing was critical, it has
not been

1259
00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:57.794
rules. Testing was critical, it has
not been handled properly. Gene, I

1260
00:40:57.794 --> 00:40:58.211
not been handled property. Gene, I
want to

1261
00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:01.627
not been handled properly. Gene, I
want to come to you on this. Paul is

1262
00:41:01.627 --> 00:41:03.252
want to come to you on this. Paul is
saying basically it is a bit of a

1263
00:41:03.252 --> 00:41:06.586
saying basically it is a bit of a
mess. I think we should have had the

1264
00:41:06.586 --> 00:41:08.877
mess. I think we should have had the
mega labs, but it has not been as

1265
00:41:08.877 --> 00:41:10.836
mega labs, but it has not been as
creative or as imaginative in

1266
00:41:10.836 --> 00:41:13.461
creative or as imaginative in
getting this going as quickly as

1267
00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:16.586
getting this going as quickly as
possible. John’s question is if the

1268
00:41:16.586 --> 00:41:17.002
possible. john’s question is if the
government

1269
00:41:17.002 --> 00:41:17.627
possible. John’s question is if the
government and the Scottish

1270
00:41:17.627 --> 00:41:19.752
government and the Scottish
Government does not know who has the

1271
00:41:19.752 --> 00:41:21.002
Government does not know who has the
vims in our

1272
00:41:21.002 --> 00:41:22.044
Government does not know who has the
virus in our communities, how can we

1273
00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:22.377
virus in our communities, how ran we
know when

1274
00:41:22.377 --> 00:41:24.461
virus in our communities, how can we
know when and where to lift

1275
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:25.461
know when and where to lift
restrictions on movement? What are

1276
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:26.377
restrictions on movement? what are
you doing there

1277
00:41:26.377 --> 00:41:27.711
restrictions on movement? What are
you doing there in order to have a

1278
00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:33.169
you doing there in order to have a
strategy on that? Our initial

1279
00:41:33.169 --> 00:41:35.377
strategy on that? Our initial
strategy was what was described as

1280
00:41:35.377 --> 00:41:36.336
strategy was what was described as
the containment strategy, when

1281
00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:40.544
the containment strategy, when
essentially you tested and tracked

1282
00:41:40.544 --> 00:41:46.002
essentially you tested and tracked
contacts and isolated those. As the

1283
00:41:46.002 --> 00:41:47.919
contacts and isolated those. As the
virus had clearly much wider

1284
00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:48.169
virus had dearty much wider
community

1285
00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:48.794
virus had clearly much wider
community transmission we moved

1286
00:41:48.794 --> 00:41:50.419
community transmission we moved
steadily into where we are now,

1287
00:41:50.419 --> 00:41:53.336
steadily into where we are now,
which is locked out. Our current

1288
00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:56.211
which is locked out. Our current
testing strategy in Scotland is to

1289
00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:58.544
testing strategy in Scotland is to
certainly test key workers, to widen

1290
00:41:58.544 --> 00:42:02.627
certainly test key workers, to widen
that now to beyond health and social

1291
00:42:02.627 --> 00:42:03.377
that now to beyond health and social
rare. We

1292
00:42:03.377 --> 00:42:06.669
that now to beyond health and social
care. We are testing over

1293
00:42:06.669 --> 00:42:10.169
care. We are testing over
70—year—olds in hospital. We are

1294
00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:10.294
70-year-olds in hospital. We are
testing

1295
00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:14.211
70—year—olds in hospital. We are
testing symptomatic patients in our

1296
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:16.252
testing symptomatic patients in our
residence in social care. And we are

1297
00:42:16.252 --> 00:42:17.336
residence in social rare. And we are
testing new

1298
00:42:17.336 --> 00:42:21.502
residence in social care. And we are
testing new admissions to our care

1299
00:42:21.502 --> 00:42:22.002
testing new admissions to our rare
homes to

1300
00:42:22.002 --> 00:42:23.336
testing new admissions to our care
homes to make sure that we are not

1301
00:42:23.336 --> 00:42:24.627
homes to make sure that we are not
bringing the virus into those care

1302
00:42:24.627 --> 00:42:26.252
bringing the virus into those rare
homes.

1303
00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:27.877
bringing the virus into those care
homes. But I think we need to be a

1304
00:42:27.877 --> 00:42:29.711
homes. But I think we need to be a
bit rareful

1305
00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:31.752
homes. But I think we need to be a
bit careful here that at the very

1306
00:42:31.752 --> 00:42:36.419
bit careful here that at the very
outset of our experience of this

1307
00:42:36.419 --> 00:42:39.502
outset of our experience of this
pandemic the evidence then, the

1308
00:42:39.502 --> 00:42:42.002
pandemic the evidence then, the
scientific and medical, clinical

1309
00:42:42.002 --> 00:42:45.211
scientific and medical, clinical
evidence, and advise then, said that

1310
00:42:45.211 --> 00:42:46.419
evidence, and advise then, said that
asymptomatic people were probably

1311
00:42:46.419 --> 00:42:46.586
asymptomatic peopla were probably
not

1312
00:42:46.586 --> 00:42:48.252
asymptomatic people were probably
not infectious. In fact, in some

1313
00:42:48.252 --> 00:42:51.419
not infectious. In fact, in some
instances the evidence said... That

1314
00:42:51.419 --> 00:42:52.836
instances the evidence said... That
is simply not correct. Paul is

1315
00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:55.794
is simply not correct. Paul is
taking issue with that. I am taking

1316
00:42:55.794 --> 00:43:00.252
taking issue with that. I am taking
issue with it... Hang on one second.

1317
00:43:00.252 --> 00:43:03.419
issue with it... Hang on one second.
This is your specialist area. We

1318
00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:05.336
This is your specialist area. We
have known for a significant period

1319
00:43:05.336 --> 00:43:06.877
have known for a significant period
of time, and it has been known

1320
00:43:06.877 --> 00:43:10.294
of time, and it has been known
across the world, that those who are

1321
00:43:10.294 --> 00:43:11.336
across the world, that those who are
infected do not always have

1322
00:43:11.336 --> 00:43:14.627
infected do not always have
symptoms. The policies should have

1323
00:43:14.627 --> 00:43:19.169
symptoms. The policies should have
been... She was saying that

1324
00:43:19.169 --> 00:43:20.086
been... She was saying that
asymptomatic people may not be

1325
00:43:20.086 --> 00:43:24.711
asymptomatic people may not be
infectious. Yes, but what I am

1326
00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:26.919
infectious. Yes, but what I am
saying is people without symptoms

1327
00:43:26.919 --> 00:43:27.127
saying is peopla without symptoms
are

1328
00:43:27.127 --> 00:43:27.669
saying is people without symptoms
are infected and therefore

1329
00:43:27.669 --> 00:43:28.961
are infected and therefore
potentially it will be transferring

1330
00:43:28.961 --> 00:43:31.961
potentially it will be transferring
the disease. That is a really

1331
00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:37.127
the disease. That is a really
significant issue.

1332
00:43:38.336 --> 00:43:42.211
significant issue. Yes it is a
significant issue. What I was saying

1333
00:43:42.211 --> 00:43:42.586
significant issue. what I was saying
was two

1334
00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.669
significant issue. What I was saying
was two points. First of all, the

1335
00:43:44.669 --> 00:43:46.461
was two points. First of all, the
evidence we were looking at and the

1336
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:48.669
evidence we were looking at and the
UK Government was looking at was

1337
00:43:48.669 --> 00:43:49.044
UK Government was looking at was
that peopla

1338
00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:52.377
UK Government was looking at was
that people without symptoms were

1339
00:43:52.377 --> 00:43:52.877
that peopla without symptoms were
unlikely to

1340
00:43:52.877 --> 00:43:54.127
that people without symptoms were
unlikely to be infectious, but more

1341
00:43:54.127 --> 00:43:56.752
unlikely to be infectious, but more
importantly that the test itself

1342
00:43:56.752 --> 00:43:59.461
importantly that the test itself
really it was only at its most

1343
00:43:59.461 --> 00:44:01.961
really it was only at its most
effective if you were symptomatic.

1344
00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:07.669
effective if you were symptomatic.
As I said earlier, this virus is 130

1345
00:44:07.669 --> 00:44:08.336
As I said eartier, this virus is 130
days or so old

1346
00:44:08.336 --> 00:44:11.919
As I said earlier, this virus is 130
days or so old here now in the UK,

1347
00:44:11.919 --> 00:44:14.127
days or so old here now in the UK,
in Scotland, and the rest of the UK

1348
00:44:14.127 --> 00:44:15.669
in Scotland, and the rest of the UK
and undoubtedly we are learning as

1349
00:44:15.669 --> 00:44:19.419
and undoubtedly we are learning as
we progress. The key is that our

1350
00:44:19.419 --> 00:44:22.002
we progress. The key is that our
strategies and our response needs to

1351
00:44:22.002 --> 00:44:22.419
strategies and our response needs to
be ﬂeet

1352
00:44:22.419 --> 00:44:25.211
strategies and our response needs to
be fleet of foot. We have increased

1353
00:44:25.211 --> 00:44:27.961
be ﬂeet of foot. We have increased
our testing

1354
00:44:27.961 --> 00:44:29.044
be fleet of foot. We have increased
our testing capacity in our NHS labs

1355
00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:33.044
our testing capacity in our NHS labs
here in Scotland, all our boards by

1356
00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:35.877
here in Scotland, all our boards by
the end of next week will have their

1357
00:44:35.877 --> 00:44:37.669
the end of next week will have their
individual capacity to gather those

1358
00:44:37.669 --> 00:44:40.252
individual capacity to gather those
tests so that in a country like

1359
00:44:40.252 --> 00:44:42.836
tests so that in a country like
Scotland with remote and rural areas

1360
00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:43.211
Scotland with remote and mral areas
it is

1361
00:44:43.211 --> 00:44:45.877
Scotland with remote and rural areas
it is particularly important, and we

1362
00:44:45.877 --> 00:44:46.211
it is particularty important, and we
will set

1363
00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:50.252
it is particularly important, and we
will set out next week our strategy

1364
00:44:50.252 --> 00:44:53.627
will set out next week our strategy
for test, trace and isolate, which

1365
00:44:53.627 --> 00:44:55.794
for test, trace and isolate, which
regardless of what we do in terms of

1366
00:44:55.794 --> 00:44:58.752
regardless of what we do in terms of
easing the current lockdown

1367
00:44:58.752 --> 00:45:01.336
easing the current lockdown
measures, will be a central part of

1368
00:45:01.336 --> 00:45:02.752
measures, will be a central part of
our response. But I also think we

1369
00:45:02.752 --> 00:45:05.211
our response. But I also think we
need to be careful that at the

1370
00:45:05.211 --> 00:45:07.544
need to be careful that at the
moment my understanding is that the

1371
00:45:07.544 --> 00:45:09.711
moment my understanding is that the
reproduction rate is considered to

1372
00:45:09.711 --> 00:45:13.252
reproduction rate is considered to
be under one stop that is

1373
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:16.252
be under one stop that is
significantly different from the

1374
00:45:16.252 --> 00:45:17.419
significantly different from the
start where it was round about

1375
00:45:17.419 --> 00:45:22.336
start where it was round about
three. It is under one, we are not

1376
00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:25.002
three. It is under one, we are not
confident yet about how far under it

1377
00:45:25.002 --> 00:45:27.419
confident yet about how far under it
is, then there is room for manoeuvre

1378
00:45:27.419 --> 00:45:29.044
is, then there is room for manoeuvre
in terms of what measures might we

1379
00:45:29.044 --> 00:45:34.627
in terms of what measures might we
ease at any one point. Yes. The

1380
00:45:34.627 --> 00:45:36.627
ease at any one point. Yes. The
question is not necessarily about

1381
00:45:36.627 --> 00:45:40.169
question is not necessarily about
what measures we might ease. In

1382
00:45:40.169 --> 00:45:40.877
what measures we might ease. In
fairness to

1383
00:45:40.877 --> 00:45:42.044
what measures we might ease. In
fairness toJohn, he is not trying

1384
00:45:42.044 --> 00:45:42.336
fairness to john, he is not trying
to look

1385
00:45:42.336 --> 00:45:43.419
fairness toJohn, he is not trying
to look backwards, he is trying to

1386
00:45:43.419 --> 00:45:46.002
to look backwards, he is trying to
look forward. How do we find out who

1387
00:45:46.002 --> 00:45:49.002
look forward. How do we find out who
has got the virus and if we don’t

1388
00:45:49.002 --> 00:45:50.419
has got the virus and if we don’t
find out, how can the government

1389
00:45:50.419 --> 00:45:50.586
find out, how ran the government
know

1390
00:45:50.586 --> 00:45:51.836
find out, how can the government
know when and where to lift the

1391
00:45:51.836 --> 00:45:56.961
know when and where to lift the
restrictions? This is an area where

1392
00:45:56.961 --> 00:45:58.794
restrictions? This is an area where
we need to see transparency and we

1393
00:45:58.794 --> 00:46:00.086
we need to see transparency and we
have been trying to be constructive

1394
00:46:00.086 --> 00:46:02.086
have been trying to be constructive
around this in having those

1395
00:46:02.086 --> 00:46:03.252
around this in having those
discussions with government and

1396
00:46:03.252 --> 00:46:05.836
discussions with government and
saying we need to be open around

1397
00:46:05.836 --> 00:46:07.461
saying we need to be open around
these questions. People will

1398
00:46:07.461 --> 00:46:08.961
these questions. People will
remember there was a debate a few

1399
00:46:08.961 --> 00:46:11.002
remember there was a debate a few
weeks ago about how we were going to

1400
00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:14.419
weeks ago about how we were going to
have antibody testing, that testing

1401
00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:16.419
have antibody testing, that testing
looking to see if people had already

1402
00:46:16.419 --> 00:46:16.836
looking to see if peopla had already
had the

1403
00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:18.336
looking to see if people had already
had the virus and that was going to

1404
00:46:18.336 --> 00:46:20.044
had the virus and that was going to
be widely available and now it

1405
00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:22.002
be widely available and now it
appears that those tests were not as

1406
00:46:22.002 --> 00:46:24.669
appears that those tests were not as
accurate as we initially thought, we

1407
00:46:24.669 --> 00:46:26.002
accurate as we initially thought, we
would not have the large numbers

1408
00:46:26.002 --> 00:46:27.211
would not have the large numbers
that we initially thought we would

1409
00:46:27.211 --> 00:46:30.211
that we initially thought we would
have. It is going to be necessary

1410
00:46:30.211 --> 00:46:33.127
have. It is going to be necessary
for us to have a pick—up in lots of

1411
00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:33.294
for us to have a pick-up in lots of
different

1412
00:46:33.294 --> 00:46:34.586
for us to have a pick—up in lots of
different kinds of activity and been

1413
00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:37.211
different kinds of activity and been
really need to see a plan around

1414
00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:39.627
really need to see a plan around
this and we have to have confidence

1415
00:46:39.627 --> 00:46:42.086
this and we have to have confidence
in this. That relates to the

1416
00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:44.669
in this. That relates to the
previous question. We need to make

1417
00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:46.669
previous question. We need to make
sure that there is buy into this

1418
00:46:46.669 --> 00:46:50.752
sure that there is buy into this
process right across the process,

1419
00:46:50.752 --> 00:46:53.002
process right across the process,
trade unions, individuals, otherwise

1420
00:46:53.002 --> 00:46:55.377
trade unions, individuals, otherwise
it will not work when we come out of

1421
00:46:55.377 --> 00:46:57.169
it will not work when we come out of
these different forms of lockdown

1422
00:46:57.169 --> 00:46:59.502
these different forms of lockdown
because you will have debates about

1423
00:46:59.502 --> 00:47:01.002
because you will have debates about
different kinds of workplaces and

1424
00:47:01.002 --> 00:47:03.544
different kinds of workplaces and
whether one is safe and one is not.

1425
00:47:03.544 --> 00:47:06.169
whether one is safe and one is not.
We need to have a clear process. I

1426
00:47:06.169 --> 00:47:06.461
We need to have a dear process. I
want to

1427
00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:08.336
We need to have a clear process. I
want to work with the Chancellor on

1428
00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:11.377
want to work with the Chancellor on
that. We have to do that openly,

1429
00:47:11.377 --> 00:47:12.419
that. We have to do that openly,
because people will raise questions

1430
00:47:12.419 --> 00:47:14.711
because people will raise questions
about it and it will not work to the

1431
00:47:14.711 --> 00:47:19.544
about it and it will not work to the
extent it could. Grant, we have had

1432
00:47:19.544 --> 00:47:20.877
extent it could. Grant, we have had
some tweets. Dan Bradshaw, a

1433
00:47:20.877 --> 00:47:26.002
some tweets. Dan Bradshaw, a
paramedic, said the government are

1434
00:47:26.002 --> 00:47:28.586
paramedic, said the government are
failing to provide PPE an adequate

1435
00:47:28.586 --> 00:47:29.794
failing to provide PPE an adequate
testing to front line health care

1436
00:47:29.794 --> 00:47:31.377
testing to front line health care
workers. I am a front line health

1437
00:47:31.377 --> 00:47:31.669
workers. I am a front line health
rare

1438
00:47:31.669 --> 00:47:33.169
workers. I am a front line health
care worker and was tested five

1439
00:47:33.169 --> 00:47:33.836
rare worker and was tested five
weeks ago

1440
00:47:33.836 --> 00:47:35.336
care worker and was tested five
weeks ago and still no results. When

1441
00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:35.877
weeks ago and still no results. when
is the

1442
00:47:35.877 --> 00:47:37.669
weeks ago and still no results. When
is the government going to get a

1443
00:47:37.669 --> 00:47:41.794
is the government going to get a
grip? Another one, Lindsay Thomas, a

1444
00:47:41.794 --> 00:47:44.794
grip? Another one, Lindsay Thomas, a
GP, what is the rationale behind the

1445
00:47:44.794 --> 00:47:46.252
GP, what is the rationale behind the
criteria for testing? This comes

1446
00:47:46.252 --> 00:47:49.627
criteria for testing? This comes
back to strategy, not a target, a

1447
00:47:49.627 --> 00:47:52.794
back to strategy, not a target, a
strategy. As a GP I cannot test

1448
00:47:52.794 --> 00:47:55.169
strategy. As a GP I cannot test
patients with symptoms, so it is

1449
00:47:55.169 --> 00:47:57.461
patients with symptoms, so it is
guesswork. Surely it makes sense for

1450
00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:59.377
guesswork. Surely it makes sense for
us to test patients feeling poorly

1451
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:01.669
us to test patients feeling poorty
enough?

1452
00:48:01.669 --> 00:48:05.961
us to test patients feeling poorly
enough? What is your response? Right

1453
00:48:05.961 --> 00:48:07.086
enough? what is your response? Right
now our testing

1454
00:48:07.086 --> 00:48:08.294
enough? What is your response? Right
now our testing capacity today of

1455
00:48:08.294 --> 00:48:09.752
now our testing capacity today of
90,000, and when we look

1456
00:48:09.752 --> 00:48:15.044
90,000, and when we look back
tomorrow on where we end on, we did

1457
00:48:15.044 --> 00:48:17.086
tomorrow on where we end on, we did
81,500 test yesterday... This is a

1458
00:48:17.086 --> 00:48:18.086
81,500 test yesterday... This is a
question about strategy rather than

1459
00:48:18.086 --> 00:48:21.502
question about strategy rather than
targets. I am trying to answer both

1460
00:48:21.502 --> 00:48:23.794
targets. I am trying to answer both
questions at the same time. It is

1461
00:48:23.794 --> 00:48:25.377
questions at the same time. It is
quite possible tomorrow that we will

1462
00:48:25.377 --> 00:48:25.586
quite possibla tomorrow that we will
see

1463
00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:29.044
quite possible tomorrow that we will
see we did reach the 100,000 target.

1464
00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:29.211
see we did reach the 100,000 target.
whether

1465
00:48:29.211 --> 00:48:31.252
see we did reach the 100,000 target.
Whether or not we did, it does not

1466
00:48:31.252 --> 00:48:32.711
whether or not we did, it does not
matter, the

1467
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:34.252
Whether or not we did, it does not
matter, the point is to have

1468
00:48:34.252 --> 00:48:35.919
matter, the point is to have
available tests. To the tweets and

1469
00:48:35.919 --> 00:48:37.294
available tests. To the tweets and
the questioner, the good thing is

1470
00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:39.419
the questioner, the good thing is
that now you can go on the

1471
00:48:39.419 --> 00:48:41.627
that now you ran go on the
government

1472
00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:42.711
that now you can go on the
government website if you are a

1473
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:44.586
government website if you are a
worker in hospital, a nurse, doctor,

1474
00:48:44.586 --> 00:48:47.377
worker in hospital, a nurse, doctor,
if you are a rare

1475
00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:47.836
worker in hospital, a nurse, doctor,
if you are a care home location,

1476
00:48:47.836 --> 00:48:48.711
if you are a rare home location,
either as a

1477
00:48:48.711 --> 00:48:50.752
if you are a care home location,
either as a resident or as somebody,

1478
00:48:50.752 --> 00:48:51.211
either as a resident or as somebody,
a rare

1479
00:48:51.211 --> 00:48:54.586
either as a resident or as somebody,
a care worker... It is not much good

1480
00:48:54.586 --> 00:48:55.586
a rare worker... It is not much good
if you have to wait

1481
00:48:55.586 --> 00:48:56.211
a care worker... It is not much good
if you have to wait five weeks. I

1482
00:48:56.211 --> 00:48:59.961
if you have to wait five weeks. I
don’t know about that case, but you

1483
00:48:59.961 --> 00:49:00.544
don’t know about that use, but you
ran go online

1484
00:49:00.544 --> 00:49:01.669
don’t know about that case, but you
can go online now and you can book a

1485
00:49:01.669 --> 00:49:02.544
ran go online now and you ran book a
place and you ran

1486
00:49:02.544 --> 00:49:04.252
can go online now and you can book a
place and you can do that either by

1487
00:49:04.252 --> 00:49:05.586
place and you ran do that either by
going to a test

1488
00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:06.419
place and you can do that either by
going to a test centre, not so good

1489
00:49:06.419 --> 00:49:09.961
going to a test centre, not so good
if you are in a place of work, or by

1490
00:49:09.961 --> 00:49:10.461
ifyou are in a place ofwork, or by
getting a home

1491
00:49:10.461 --> 00:49:11.336
if you are in a place of work, or by
getting a home test. I’ll give you

1492
00:49:11.336 --> 00:49:13.544
getting a home test. I’ll give you
an example of the speed at which

1493
00:49:13.544 --> 00:49:15.169
an example of the speed at which
this has been scaled up, at the

1494
00:49:15.169 --> 00:49:17.752
this has been scaled up, at the
beginning of the week there were

1495
00:49:17.752 --> 00:49:19.586
beginning of the week there were
only 5000 home tests available and

1496
00:49:19.586 --> 00:49:21.377
only 5000 home tests available and
now there are 20,000 available and

1497
00:49:21.377 --> 00:49:24.294
now there are 20,000 available and
that is why we would like to meet

1498
00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:27.169
that is why we would like to meet
the 100,000 target. The point is

1499
00:49:27.169 --> 00:49:27.669
the 100,000 target. The point is
peopla

1500
00:49:27.669 --> 00:49:29.669
the 100,000 target. The point is
people should be able to go online,

1501
00:49:29.669 --> 00:49:30.044
peopla should be able to go online,
order it

1502
00:49:30.044 --> 00:49:35.127
people should be able to go online,
order it themselves and get it done.

1503
00:49:35.127 --> 00:49:38.169
What about knowing where and when

1504
00:49:38.169 --> 00:49:38.544
what about knowing where and when
and who

1505
00:49:38.544 --> 00:49:42.044
What about knowing where and when
and who has coronavirus, that is

1506
00:49:42.044 --> 00:49:42.544
and who has coronavims, that is
about

1507
00:49:42.544 --> 00:49:45.502
and who has coronavirus, that is
about contact rating, which you

1508
00:49:45.502 --> 00:49:48.502
about contact rating, which you
stopped early on? We expanded it to

1509
00:49:48.502 --> 00:49:48.711
stopped earty on? We expanded it to
symptomatic

1510
00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:50.544
stopped early on? We expanded it to
symptomatic and asymptomatic care

1511
00:49:50.544 --> 00:49:50.877
symptomatic and asymptomatic rare
workers, for

1512
00:49:50.877 --> 00:49:51.836
symptomatic and asymptomatic care
workers, for example. People can

1513
00:49:51.836 --> 00:49:52.586
workers, for example. People ran
take this

1514
00:49:52.586 --> 00:49:55.252
workers, for example. People can
take this test if they are concerned

1515
00:49:55.252 --> 00:49:57.002
take this test if they are concerned
at this stage. To the track and

1516
00:49:57.002 --> 00:49:59.461
at this stage. To the track and
trace thing, we started off with a

1517
00:49:59.461 --> 00:50:02.336
trace thing, we started off with a
low capacity, but I take Paul’s

1518
00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:04.794
low capacity, but I take Paul’s
point, he is the expert in this. He

1519
00:50:04.794 --> 00:50:09.211
point, he is the expert in this. He
said you were too slow. We started

1520
00:50:09.211 --> 00:50:11.211
said you were too slow. We started
off with 2000 tests at the beginning

1521
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:14.086
off with 2000 tests at the beginning
of this crisis, it is now getting to

1522
00:50:14.086 --> 00:50:16.211
of this crisis, it is now getting to
100,000 or above and there is

1523
00:50:16.211 --> 00:50:18.086
100,000 or above and there is
another super lab opening in

1524
00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:19.419
another super lab opening in
Cambridge on Monday. We had to

1525
00:50:19.419 --> 00:50:20.961
Cambridge on Monday. We had to
create the testing capacity for the

1526
00:50:20.961 --> 00:50:25.919
create the testing capacity for the
most part, although I accept there

1527
00:50:25.919 --> 00:50:28.336
most part, although I accept there
maybe some things others could have

1528
00:50:28.336 --> 00:50:30.211
maybe some things others could have
done, you are the expert. But it is

1529
00:50:30.211 --> 00:50:33.002
done, you are the expert. But it is
a huge effort to build this up. We

1530
00:50:33.002 --> 00:50:34.544
a huge effort to build this up. We
couldn’t maintain that process. Of

1531
00:50:34.544 --> 00:50:36.502
couldn’t maintain that process. Of
the tests that we had, when the

1532
00:50:36.502 --> 00:50:37.919
the tests that we had, when the
tests that we had, when this got

1533
00:50:37.919 --> 00:50:40.252
tests that we had, when this got
large enough that it was in society,

1534
00:50:40.252 --> 00:50:42.877
large enough that it was in society,
we focus the available testing,

1535
00:50:42.877 --> 00:50:44.627
we focus the available testing,
rightly on scientific advice in the

1536
00:50:44.627 --> 00:50:46.419
rightly on scientific advice in the
hospitals, which required front—line

1537
00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:47.627
hospitals, which required front-line
testing. In the

1538
00:50:47.627 --> 00:50:49.002
hospitals, which required front—line
testing. In the ideal world, if we

1539
00:50:49.002 --> 00:50:52.086
testing. In the ideal world, if we
were to do this again, we would have

1540
00:50:52.086 --> 00:50:54.502
were to do this again, we would have
a 100,000 test capacity and more

1541
00:50:54.502 --> 00:50:56.877
a 100,000 test capacity and more
from the outset. 0n contact tracing,

1542
00:50:56.877 --> 00:50:59.127
from the outset. On contact tracing,
we are looking for the app to be

1543
00:50:59.127 --> 00:51:01.752
we are looking for the app to be

give you the heads up to go and get
tested. 50 that will be an important

1554
00:51:23.086 --> 00:51:24.627
tested. So that will be an important
part in taking us

1555

tested. 50 that will be an important

come back to this, but does that

come back to this, but does that
strategy sank clear to you? Testing

1558
00:51:32.252 --> 00:51:33.711
strategy sank dear to you? Testing
is critical

1559
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:35.544
strategy sank clear to you? Testing
is critical to easing the lockdown

1560
00:51:35.544 --> 00:51:36.711
is critical to easing the lockdown
and using technology, as they have

1561
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:39.211
and using technology, as they have
done in South Korea and these other

1562
00:51:39.211 --> 00:51:41.252
done in South Korea and these other
Asian countries, even with the

1563
00:51:41.252 --> 00:51:41.377
Asian countries, even with the
intmsion

1564
00:51:41.377 --> 00:51:42.502
Asian countries, even with the
intrusion on our privacy that is

1565
00:51:42.502 --> 00:51:43.377
intmsion on our privacy that is
going to

1566
00:51:43.377 --> 00:51:44.377
intrusion on our privacy that is
going to bring, is going to be

1567
00:51:44.377 --> 00:51:46.711
going to bring, is going to be
critical to get the economy back on

1568
00:51:46.711 --> 00:51:48.627
critical to get the economy back on
its feet. What everyone has alluded

1569
00:51:48.627 --> 00:51:49.377
its feet. what everyone has alluded
to here, is

1570
00:51:49.377 --> 00:51:50.544
its feet. What everyone has alluded
to here, is the difficulties in

1571
00:51:50.544 --> 00:51:52.502
to here, is the difficulties in
getting the testing programme off

1572
00:51:52.502 --> 00:51:54.419
getting the testing programme off
the ground, the enormous bureaucracy

1573
00:51:54.419 --> 00:51:58.419
the ground, the enormous bureaucracy
that was encountered, the failure to

1574
00:51:58.419 --> 00:51:59.377
that was encountered, the failure to
involve people outside Public Health

1575
00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:01.211
involve peopla outside Public Health
England and

1576
00:52:01.211 --> 00:52:02.627
involve people outside Public Health
England and laboratories like

1577
00:52:02.627 --> 00:52:05.044
England and laboratories like
Paul’s. I actually think Matt

1578
00:52:05.044 --> 00:52:05.919
Paul’s. I actually think Matt
Hancock did the

1579
00:52:05.919 --> 00:52:06.169
Paul’s. I actually think Matt
Hancock did thejob

1580
00:52:06.169 --> 00:52:07.127
Paul’s. I actually think Matt
Hancock did the job that sometimes

1581
00:52:07.127 --> 00:52:08.586
Hancock did the job that sometimes
the Secretary of State needs to,

1582
00:52:08.586 --> 00:52:11.127
the Secretary of State needs to,
here is a bloody great target and go

1583
00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:14.294
here is a bloody great target and go
and hit it. I think he has a great

1584
00:52:14.294 --> 00:52:15.836
and hit it. I think he has a great
chance, amazingly, of hitting it.

1585
00:52:15.836 --> 00:52:18.669
chance, amazingly, of hitting it.
Let’s not repeat all this if we get

1586
00:52:18.669 --> 00:52:21.002
Let’s not repeat all this if we get
a vaccine. We should be planning

1587
00:52:21.002 --> 00:52:23.627
a vaccine. We should be planning
now, I have no idea, I am

1588
00:52:23.627 --> 00:52:23.794
a vaccine. We should be planning
now, I have no idea, lam not

1589
00:52:23.794 --> 00:52:23.961
a vaccine. We should be planning
now, I have no idea, I am not a

1590
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:24.252
now, I have no idea, lam nota
scientist

1591
00:52:24.252 --> 00:52:26.211
now, I have no idea, I am not a
scientist and I don’t know if a

1592
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:27.794
scientist and I don’t know if a
vaccine will be developed into

1593
00:52:27.794 --> 00:52:31.002
vaccine will be developed into
months or two years, but when it

1594
00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:32.336
months or two years, but when it
comes, if a government cannot

1595
00:52:32.336 --> 00:52:34.252
comes, if a government cannot
vaccinate everyone in the population

1596
00:52:34.252 --> 00:52:36.002
vaccinate everyone in the population
who wants that vaccine, pretty

1597
00:52:36.002 --> 00:52:38.377
who wants that vaccine, pretty
quickly, then I think they will be

1598
00:52:38.377 --> 00:52:38.752
quickly, than I think they will be
in real

1599
00:52:38.752 --> 00:52:40.586
quickly, then I think they will be
in real trouble. I think they should

1600
00:52:40.586 --> 00:52:40.961
in real trouhla. I think they should
be learning

1601
00:52:40.961 --> 00:52:42.711
in real trouble. I think they should
be learning from this experience,

1602
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:43.336
be learning from this experience,
not just

1603
00:52:43.336 --> 00:52:44.586
be learning from this experience,
notjust politicians, but the people

1604
00:52:44.586 --> 00:52:46.961
not just politicians, but the peopla
who mn

1605
00:52:46.961 --> 00:52:48.752
notjust politicians, but the people
who run the NHS, and working out

1606
00:52:48.752 --> 00:52:49.502
who nm the NHS, and working out
how, once

1607
00:52:49.502 --> 00:52:50.919
who run the NHS, and working out
how, once the vaccine is discovered,

1608
00:52:50.919 --> 00:52:55.336
how, once the vaccine is discovered,
which we all hope will happen, think

1609
00:52:55.336 --> 00:52:57.836
which we all hope will happen, think
ahead to where you are going to be

1610
00:52:57.836 --> 00:53:00.419
ahead to where you are going to be
and hopefully in a few months, maybe

1611
00:53:00.419 --> 00:53:04.002
and hopefully in a few months, maybe
a few years. I want another

1612
00:53:04.002 --> 00:53:08.169
a few years. I want another
question, but Paul you want to come

1613
00:53:08.169 --> 00:53:10.752
question, but Paul you want to come
back quickly. Testing is critical, I

1614
00:53:10.752 --> 00:53:12.252
back quickly. Testing is critical, I
work on yeast and I only learned

1615
00:53:12.252 --> 00:53:15.794
work on yeast and I only learned
this in the last month or so. But

1616
00:53:15.794 --> 00:53:17.252
this in the last month or so. But
testing is critical. We have been in

1617
00:53:17.252 --> 00:53:19.127
testing is critical. We have been in
the front line over this and over

1618
00:53:19.127 --> 00:53:22.502
the front line over this and over
the last number of weeks front line

1619
00:53:22.502 --> 00:53:23.586
the last number of weeks front line
workers have been begging for

1620
00:53:23.586 --> 00:53:28.627
workers have been begging for
testing. They haven’t even provided

1621
00:53:28.627 --> 00:53:31.586
testing. They haven’t even provided
it. 8000 community nurses in North

1622
00:53:31.586 --> 00:53:35.544
it. 8000 community nurses in North
London had five tests a day. This is

1623
00:53:35.544 --> 00:53:37.336
London had five tests a day. This is
no way to mn

1624
00:53:37.336 --> 00:53:37.627
London had five tests a day. This is
no way to nm a

1625
00:53:37.627 --> 00:53:39.919
London had five tests a day. This is
no way to run a ship. Then we have

1626
00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:40.002
no way to nm a ship. Then we have
this

1627
00:53:40.002 --> 00:53:40.461
no way to mn a ship. Then we have
this question of

1628
00:53:40.461 --> 00:53:40.919
no way to run a ship. Then we have
this question of capability of

1629
00:53:40.919 --> 00:53:47.586
this question of capability of
testing. Capacity. Capacity. You are

1630
00:53:47.586 --> 00:53:49.252
testing. Capacity. Capacity. You are
the transport Minister, let’s take a

1631
00:53:49.252 --> 00:53:52.002
the transport Minister, let’s take a
train metaphor. We are travelling

1632
00:53:52.002 --> 00:53:54.002
train metaphor. We are travelling
from London to Paris, 0K? The

1633
00:53:54.002 --> 00:53:55.586
from London to Paris, 0K? The
Channel Tunnel and may have capacity

1634
00:53:55.586 --> 00:53:58.252
Channel Tunnel and may have capacity
for ten trains an hour but if you

1635
00:53:58.252 --> 00:54:00.461
for ten trains an hour but if you
only get three trains an hour to the

1636
00:54:00.461 --> 00:54:02.544
only get three trains an hour to the
tunnel and three trains out, you

1637
00:54:02.544 --> 00:54:05.377
tunnel and three trains out, you
will have only testing at three. The

1638
00:54:05.377 --> 00:54:08.211
will have only testing at three. The
real problem we are having is the

1639
00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.502
real problem we are having is the
workﬂow of getting actually the

1640
00:54:09.502 --> 00:54:09.711
workﬂow of getting actually the
samplas

1641
00:54:09.711 --> 00:54:13.169
workflow of getting actually the
samples out, getting the IT sorted,

1642
00:54:13.169 --> 00:54:15.961
samples out, getting the IT sorted,
actually putting the whole process,

1643
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:16.211
actually putting the whola process,
focus

1644
00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:17.544
actually putting the whole process,
focus on the mega labs without

1645
00:54:17.544 --> 00:54:19.752
focus on the mega labs without
dealing with the workﬂow. That was

1646
00:54:19.752 --> 00:54:22.794
dealing with the workﬂow. That was
obvious to us weeks and weeks ago.

1647
00:54:22.794 --> 00:54:25.002
obvious to us weeks and weeks ago.
We have been telling people about it

1648
00:54:25.002 --> 00:54:27.377
We have been telling people about it
for weeks and weeks. It has been

1649
00:54:27.377 --> 00:54:27.794
for weeks and weeks. It has been
pitifuuy slow

1650
00:54:27.794 --> 00:54:29.211
for weeks and weeks. It has been
pitifully slow to accept that that

1651
00:54:29.211 --> 00:54:29.919
pitifuuy slow to accept that that
is a big

1652
00:54:29.919 --> 00:54:32.044
pitifully slow to accept that that
is a big issue. A big mega lab will

1653
00:54:32.044 --> 00:54:34.294
is a big issue. A big mega lab will
have difficulties, they need to sort

1654
00:54:34.294 --> 00:54:36.627
have difficulties, they need to sort
it. It is easier for the smaller

1655
00:54:36.627 --> 00:54:38.252
it. It is easier for the smaller
labs, of course it is easier and

1656
00:54:38.252 --> 00:54:40.252
labs, of course it is easier and
that should have been recognised at

1657
00:54:40.252 --> 00:54:41.169
that should have been recognised at
the beginning. Lessons could have

1658
00:54:41.169 --> 00:54:44.377
the beginning. Lessons could have
been learnt from us, you could have

1659
00:54:44.377 --> 00:54:46.502
been learnt from us, you could have
used us as research tools to help

1660
00:54:46.502 --> 00:54:50.044
used us as research tools to help
drive the mega labs. It need a great

1661
00:54:50.044 --> 00:54:51.211
drive the mega labs. It need a great
imagination, greater leadership

1662
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:54.336
imagination, greater leadership
really about the political and also

1663
00:54:54.336 --> 00:54:56.252
really about the political and also
frankly, the scientific and medical

1664
00:54:56.252 --> 00:54:58.002
frankly, the scientific and medical
level. When we come to look at it we

1665
00:54:58.002 --> 00:54:58.502
lavel. when we come to look at it we
will see

1666
00:54:58.502 --> 00:54:58.752
level. when we come to look at it we
will see we

1667
00:54:58.752 --> 00:55:00.961
level. When we come to look at it we
will see we have had many lessons we

1668
00:55:00.961 --> 00:55:01.211
will see we have had many lassons we
should

1669
00:55:01.211 --> 00:55:01.794
will see we have had many lessons we
should have learned. I

1670
00:55:01.794 --> 00:55:02.377
will see we have had many lessons we
should have learned. Ijust want to

1671
00:55:02.377 --> 00:55:04.752
should have learned. Ijust want to
take one more question, if I can. We

1672
00:55:04.752 --> 00:55:06.002
take one more question, if I ran. We
have spent a long

1673
00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:07.419
take one more question, if I can. We
have spent a long time talking about

1674
00:55:07.419 --> 00:55:09.502
have spent a long time talking about
this and not gotten as many

1675
00:55:09.502 --> 00:55:11.627
this and not gotten as many
questions as I would like. Good

1676
00:55:11.627 --> 00:55:13.461
questions as I would like. Good
evening. My name is

1677
00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:13.877
questions as I would like. Good
evening. My name isJulie Benson

1678
00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:14.044
evening. My name is julie Benson
from

1679
00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:14.419
evening. My name isJulie Benson
from Leeds. I

1680
00:55:14.419 --> 00:55:16.002
evening. My name isJulie Benson
from Leeds. Iwould

1681
00:55:16.002 --> 00:55:17.169
evening. My name isJulie Benson
from Leeds. I would like to ask the

1682
00:55:17.169 --> 00:55:19.002
from Leeds. I would like to ask the
panel, in Australia when people were

1683
00:55:19.002 --> 00:55:19.586
panel, in Australia when people were
ﬂying back in

1684
00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:22.544
panel, in Australia when people were
flying back in before they close the

1685
00:55:22.544 --> 00:55:22.794
ﬂying back in before they close the
borders,

1686
00:55:22.794 --> 00:55:24.752
flying back in before they close the
borders, people were made to isolate

1687
00:55:24.752 --> 00:55:27.211
borders, people were made to isolate
into a hotel for two weeks and were

1688
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:29.669
into a hotel for two weeks and were
not allowed to go home until they

1689
00:55:29.669 --> 00:55:32.169
not allowed to go home until they
were tested and cleared. I would

1690
00:55:32.169 --> 00:55:34.544
were tested and cleared. I would
like to understand why we are not

1691
00:55:34.544 --> 00:55:37.044
like to understand why we are not
taking those kinds of measures in

1692
00:55:37.044 --> 00:55:39.169
taking those kinds of measures in
this country, why we are allowing

1693
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:39.877
this country, why we are allowing
peopla to ﬂy

1694
00:55:39.877 --> 00:55:42.377
this country, why we are allowing
people to fly in and not isolating

1695
00:55:42.377 --> 00:55:42.502
peopla to ﬂy in and not isolating
them

1696
00:55:42.502 --> 00:55:46.502
people to fly in and not isolating
them the same in a hotel. Thank you.

1697
00:55:46.502 --> 00:55:48.752
them the same in a hotel. Thank you.
Week after week, this question has

1698
00:55:48.752 --> 00:55:50.336
Week after week, this question has
come up, which is why I wanted to

1699
00:55:50.336 --> 00:55:54.294
come up, which is why I wanted to
take it tonight. Jeane, this is

1700
00:55:54.294 --> 00:55:54.502
take it tonight. jeane, this is
happening

1701
00:55:54.502 --> 00:55:56.336
take it tonight. Jeane, this is
happening in Scotland as well as the

1702
00:55:56.336 --> 00:55:57.919
happening in Scotland as well as the
rest of the UK, is going to change

1703
00:55:57.919 --> 00:56:00.461
rest of the UK, is going to change
or are we going to let people in

1704
00:56:00.461 --> 00:56:01.961
or are we going to let peopla in
willy-nilly?

1705
00:56:01.961 --> 00:56:04.252
or are we going to let people in
willy—nilly? We cannot make that

1706
00:56:04.252 --> 00:56:04.461
willy-nilly? We cannot make that
decision

1707
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:05.961
willy—nilly? We cannot make that
decision in Scotland, because the

1708
00:56:05.961 --> 00:56:06.961
decision in Scotland, because the
decision about ports, whether they

1709
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:12.586
decision about ports, whether they
are airports, is made by the

1710
00:56:12.586 --> 00:56:13.919
are airports, is made by the
government. What would you like to

1711
00:56:13.919 --> 00:56:16.752
government. what would you like to
happen? The

1712
00:56:16.752 --> 00:56:18.627
government. What would you like to
happen? The question she just asked

1713
00:56:18.627 --> 00:56:20.586
happen? The question she just asked
is absolutely right. We will be

1714
00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:22.044
is absolutely right. We will be
wanting the UK Government to give

1715
00:56:22.044 --> 00:56:26.002
wanting the UK Government to give
very serious consideration to

1716
00:56:26.002 --> 00:56:27.127
very serious consideration to
stopping the inward transmission of

1717
00:56:27.127 --> 00:56:30.461
stopping the inward transmission of
the virus. Particularly given the

1718
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:30.836
the vims. Particularty given the
fact

1719
00:56:30.836 --> 00:56:33.002
the virus. Particularly given the
fact that the people across Scotland

1720
00:56:33.002 --> 00:56:33.127
fact that the peopla across Scotland
and

1721
00:56:33.127 --> 00:56:33.544
fact that the people across Scotland
andindeed

1722
00:56:33.544 --> 00:56:36.586
fact that the people across Scotland
and indeed across the UK have worked

1723
00:56:36.586 --> 00:56:37.961
and indeed across the UK have worked
so hard to successfully

1724
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:38.127
and indeed across the UK have worked
so he rd to successfully suppress

1725
00:56:38.127 --> 00:56:38.294
and indeed across the UK have worked
so hard to successfully suppress it

1726
00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:38.919
so hard to successfuuy suppress it
to this point.

1727
00:56:38.919 --> 00:56:42.169
so hard to successfully suppress it
to this point. It seems to me

1728
00:56:42.169 --> 00:56:43.752
to this point. It seems to me
foolhardy to then not give serious

1729
00:56:43.752 --> 00:56:45.002
foolhardy to then not give serious
consideration to what we do about

1730
00:56:45.002 --> 00:56:48.669
consideration to what we do about
international travel both into and

1731
00:56:48.669 --> 00:56:50.752
international travel both into and
out of the UK. Is this something you

1732
00:56:50.752 --> 00:56:54.127
out of the UK. Is this something you
have been pushing for, as the

1733
00:56:54.127 --> 00:56:56.044
have been pushing for, as the
Scottish Government? It is something

1734
00:56:56.044 --> 00:56:58.502
Scottish Government? It is something
we have raised and then continuing

1735
00:56:58.502 --> 00:57:00.627
we have raised and then continuing
discussions of we have collectively

1736
00:57:00.627 --> 00:57:00.836
discussions of we have collactively
looked

1737
00:57:00.836 --> 00:57:02.294
discussions of we have collectively
looked across the four nations to

1738
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:05.586
looked across the four nations to
look at what measures we might make

1739
00:57:05.586 --> 00:57:07.669
look at what measures we might make
to ease the lockdown and that is one

1740
00:57:07.669 --> 00:57:10.127
to ease the lockdown and that is one
of the areas we will pursue with the

1741
00:57:10.127 --> 00:57:11.711
of the areas we will pursue with the
UK Government and the Prime Minister

1742
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:14.211
UK Government and the Prime Minister
in the discussions that we have.

1743
00:57:14.211 --> 00:57:15.627
in the discussions that we have.
People have been asking this time

1744
00:57:15.627 --> 00:57:19.502
People have been asking this time
and time again and cannot

1745
00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:21.127
and time again and cannot
understand, and I can’t either, when

1746
00:57:21.127 --> 00:57:22.711
understand, and I can’t either, when
so many other countries put people

1747
00:57:22.711 --> 00:57:22.919
so many other countries put peopla
into

1748
00:57:22.919 --> 00:57:24.127
so many other countries put people
into quarantine if they come into

1749
00:57:24.127 --> 00:57:28.544
into quarantine if they come into
the country? I think there have been

1750
00:57:28.544 --> 00:57:30.294
the country? I think there have been
serious concerns around this. What

1751
00:57:30.294 --> 00:57:30.794
serious concerns around this. what
we have

1752
00:57:30.794 --> 00:57:31.752
serious concerns around this. What
we have been saying to government,

1753
00:57:31.752 --> 00:57:34.711
we have been saying to government,
it needs to be open around its

1754
00:57:34.711 --> 00:57:36.002
it needs to be open around its
reasoning on this question. It is

1755
00:57:36.002 --> 00:57:37.961
reasoning on this question. It is
not that he wanted to change, but

1756
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:39.544
not that he wanted to change, but
you want to understand the reason?

1757
00:57:39.544 --> 00:57:42.794
you want to understand the reason?
We need to understand why that

1758
00:57:42.794 --> 00:57:44.211
We need to understand why that
decision has been taken because

1759
00:57:44.211 --> 00:57:45.794
decision has been taken because
practice in other countries has been

1760
00:57:45.794 --> 00:57:47.002
practice in other countries has been
different. If we look at other

1761
00:57:47.002 --> 00:57:49.252
different. If we look at other
people coming into the country, I

1762
00:57:49.252 --> 00:57:49.377
peopla coming into the country, I
have

1763
00:57:49.377 --> 00:57:50.752
people coming into the country, I
have dealt with huge numbers of

1764
00:57:50.752 --> 00:57:53.794
have dealt with huge numbers of
Brits around the world who would

1765
00:57:53.794 --> 00:57:55.752
Brits around the world who would
desperately love to be back here and

1766
00:57:55.752 --> 00:57:58.002
desperately love to be back here and
are being brought back at a much

1767
00:57:58.002 --> 00:58:00.169
are being brought back at a much
slower rate. Maybe Grant can

1768
00:58:00.169 --> 00:58:00.711
slower rate. Maybe Grant ran
enlighten us

1769
00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:02.419
slower rate. Maybe Grant can
enlighten us a little bit more. I

1770
00:58:02.419 --> 00:58:04.419
enlighten us a little bit more. I
accept on the one hand, some of the

1771
00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:06.294
accept on the one hand, some of the
measures that were put in place in

1772
00:58:06.294 --> 00:58:07.961
measures that were put in place in
other nations haven’t necessarily

1773
00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:11.044
other nations haven’t necessarily
worked. For example, temperature

1774
00:58:11.044 --> 00:58:12.877
worked. For example, temperature
measurement as people come in,

1775
00:58:12.877 --> 00:58:16.169
measurement as people come in,
because that is not robust,

1776
00:58:16.169 --> 00:58:17.836
because that is not robust,
obviously. We do need to look at the

1777
00:58:17.836 --> 00:58:19.211
obviously. We do need to look at the
fact that potentially there have

1778
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:21.252
fact that potentially there have
been people coming into the country

1779
00:58:21.252 --> 00:58:24.127
been people coming into the country
who might have been taking the virus

1780
00:58:24.127 --> 00:58:26.669
who might have been taking the virus
with them. But this is conjoined

1781
00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:28.377
with them. But this is conjoined
with the testing issue. I am sorry

1782
00:58:28.377 --> 00:58:30.586
with the testing issue. I am sorry
to bring it back to that and I know

1783
00:58:30.586 --> 00:58:32.169
to bring it back to that and I know
we have been talking about it, but

1784
00:58:32.169 --> 00:58:33.627
we have been talking about it, but
people who have come back into the

1785
00:58:33.627 --> 00:58:33.961
peopla who have come back into the
country had

1786
00:58:33.961 --> 00:58:35.502
people who have come back into the
country had then been able to

1787
00:58:35.502 --> 00:58:37.461
country had then been able to
quickly access a test for themselves

1788
00:58:37.461 --> 00:58:39.627
quickly access a test for themselves
to know what their situation was,

1789
00:58:39.627 --> 00:58:41.377
to know what their situation was,
then we could have dealt with this

1790
00:58:41.377 --> 00:58:43.044
then we could have dealt with this
more robustly. I think this is more

1791
00:58:43.044 --> 00:58:44.794
more robustly. I think this is more
of an issue because we don’t yet

1792
00:58:44.794 --> 00:58:47.044
of an issue because we don’t yet
have that community testing in the

1793
00:58:47.044 --> 00:58:49.502
have that community testing in the
UK to the extent that applies in

1794
00:58:49.502 --> 00:58:51.294
UK to the extent that applies in
many other country. Henry has

1795
00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:53.336
many other country. Henry has
tweeted, we are all on the up down

1796
00:58:53.336 --> 00:58:54.002
tweeted, we are all on the up down
so ban peopla

1797
00:58:54.002 --> 00:58:54.711
tweeted, we are all on the up down
so ban people coming into this

1798
00:58:54.711 --> 00:58:54.919
so ban peopla coming into this
country

1799
00:58:54.919 --> 00:58:56.419
so ban people coming into this
country would have been tested and

1800
00:58:56.419 --> 00:58:58.961
country would have been tested and
they should spend 1A days in

1801
00:58:58.961 --> 00:58:59.086
they should spend 14 days in
quarantine.

1802
00:58:59.086 --> 00:58:59.752
they should spend 1A days in
quarantine. Australia and New

1803
00:58:59.752 --> 00:59:02.169
quarantine. Australia and New
Zealand were introducing this policy

1804
00:59:02.169 --> 00:59:04.586
Zealand were introducing this policy
when we were going to the Cheltenham

1805
00:59:04.586 --> 00:59:05.794
when we were going to the Cheltenham
races. Is this going to change,

1806
00:59:05.794 --> 00:59:09.336
races. Is this going to change,
grand? Different countries are in

1807
00:59:09.336 --> 00:59:11.002
grand? Different countries are in
different moments of this pandemic

1808
00:59:11.002 --> 00:59:13.919
different moments of this pandemic
at different times. But whilst it is

1809
00:59:13.919 --> 00:59:16.294
at different times. But whilst it is
endemic in this country, in other

1810
00:59:16.294 --> 00:59:18.086
endemic in this country, in other
words prevalent across the

1811
00:59:18.086 --> 00:59:19.961
words prevalent across the
population, it makes no great

1812
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:22.044
population, it makes no great
difference to the overall figures,

1813
00:59:22.044 --> 00:59:24.169
difference to the overall figures,
according to the scientists and

1814
00:59:24.169 --> 00:59:25.169
according to the scientists and
medical experts. However, that

1815
00:59:25.169 --> 00:59:27.752
medical experts. However, that
changes as we get a grip of those

1816
00:59:27.752 --> 00:59:28.961
changes as we get a grip of those
numbers and then becomes something

1817
00:59:28.961 --> 00:59:30.836
numbers and then becomes something
which is very valuable to do. Isn’t

1818
00:59:30.836 --> 00:59:33.086
which is very valuabla to do. Isn’t
that the

1819
00:59:33.086 --> 00:59:36.752
which is very valuable to do. Isn’t
that the case now, we are below one?

1820
00:59:36.752 --> 00:59:37.252
that the use now, we are below one?
Starting to use

1821
00:59:37.252 --> 00:59:37.711
that the case now, we are below one?
Starting to use the classic

1822
00:59:37.711 --> 00:59:39.294
Starting to use the classic
flattening of the curve, it is

1823
00:59:39.294 --> 00:59:39.711
ﬂattening of the curve, it is
starting to

1824
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:40.711
flattening of the curve, it is
starting to come down but there is

1825
00:59:40.711 --> 00:59:43.669
starting to come down but there is
the important point of returning

1826
00:59:43.669 --> 00:59:46.711
the important point of returning
British nationals, but it is

1827
00:59:46.711 --> 00:59:49.294
British nationals, but it is
absolutely true to say, if the

1828
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:49.502
absolutely tme to say, if the
British

1829
00:59:49.502 --> 00:59:50.294
absolutely true to say, if the
British people themselves are being

1830
00:59:50.294 --> 00:59:52.711
British people themselves are being
asked to continue with social

1831
00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:54.294
asked to continue with social
distancing measures, it is quite

1832
00:59:54.294 --> 00:59:56.502
distancing measures, it is quite
right to expect people coming into

1833
00:59:56.502 --> 00:59:58.294
right to expect people coming into
the country would have the same

1834
00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:01.127
the country would have the same
measures apply to them. So it is

1835
01:00:01.127 --> 01:00:02.711
measures apply to them. So it is
actually something very much as we

1836
01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:04.419
actually something very much as we
get to the smaller numbers and not

1837
01:00:04.419 --> 01:00:07.169
get to the smaller numbers and not
wanting to see a repeat of the

1838
01:00:07.169 --> 01:00:11.127
wanting to see a repeat of the
infection, something very much as a

1839
01:00:11.127 --> 01:00:15.544
infection, something very much as a
line of discussion. Paul? It is

1840
01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:17.336
line of discussion. Paul? It is
obvious, we should be doing it and I

1841
01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:18.711
obvious, we should be doing it and I
hope with the capacity for testing

1842
01:00:18.711 --> 01:00:21.294
hope with the capacity for testing
we would have in place and with the

1843
01:00:21.294 --> 01:00:22.502
we would have in place and with the
recognition of the importance of

1844
01:00:22.502 --> 01:00:24.502
recognition of the importance of
this, in the coming months we will

1845
01:00:24.502 --> 01:00:25.627
this, in the coming months we will
introduce this because this is not

1846
01:00:25.627 --> 01:00:28.544
introduce this because this is not
going to go away in a hurry. He

1847
01:00:28.544 --> 01:00:32.044
going to go away in a hurry. He
would require people coming into the

1848
01:00:32.044 --> 01:00:33.711
would require people coming into the
country to download the NHS app for

1849

country to download the NHS app for
the track and tracing purposes as

1850
01:00:36.419 --> 01:00:38.294
the track and tracing purposes as
well. I entirely agree with the

1851
01:00:38.294 --> 01:00:42.252
well. I entirely agree with the
question. The lesson of all of this

1852
01:00:42.252 --> 01:00:43.044
question. The lasson of all of this
is treat

1853
01:00:43.044 --> 01:00:44.336
question. The lesson of all of this
is treat the public like adults and

1854
01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:47.127
is treat the public like adults and
explain to them exactly why you are

1855
01:00:47.127 --> 01:00:48.127
explain to them exactly why you are
doing these things. Otherwise people

1856
01:00:48.127 --> 01:00:52.502
doing these things. Otherwise people
sit at home and they go, hold on

1857
01:00:52.502 --> 01:00:53.919
sit at home and they go, hold on
there is a walker in Derbyshire and

1858
01:00:53.919 --> 01:00:56.711
there is a walker in Derbyshire and
they have a drone following them and

1859
01:00:56.711 --> 01:00:58.294
they have a drone following them and
barking at them to go back home when

1860
01:00:58.294 --> 01:01:01.752
barking at them to go back home when
you have thousands of people going

1861
01:01:01.752 --> 01:01:01.919
you have thousands of peopla going
through

1862
01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:03.502
you have thousands of people going
through Heathrow Airport. Grant

1863

through Heathrow Airport. Grant
says, the scientists tell us at the

1864
01:01:06.419 --> 01:01:07.836
says, the scientists tell us at the
moment it is not statistically

1865
01:01:07.836 --> 01:01:10.752
moment it is not statistically
significant, then the Walker on his

1866
01:01:10.752 --> 01:01:11.127
significant, than the Walker on his
own is

1867
01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:14.252
significant, then the Walker on his
own is not statistically significant

1868
01:01:14.252 --> 01:01:16.919
own is not statistically significant
either. People are very afraid,

1869
01:01:16.919 --> 01:01:17.711
either. People are very afraid,
understandably for themselves and

1870
01:01:17.711 --> 01:01:19.252
understandably for themselves and
their loved ones and they will take

1871
01:01:19.252 --> 01:01:21.752
their loved ones and they will take
the word of the government and the

1872
01:01:21.752 --> 01:01:23.752
the word of the government and the
Prime Minister stands there, as he

1873
01:01:23.752 --> 01:01:25.669
Prime Minister stands there, as he
did today, he is very optimistic and

1874
01:01:25.669 --> 01:01:27.294
did today, he is very optimistic and
impressive when he does that but I

1875
01:01:27.294 --> 01:01:29.544
impressive when he does that but I
think we are coming to the end of

1876
01:01:29.544 --> 01:01:35.002
think we are coming to the end of
taking the ministerial information.

1877
01:01:35.002 --> 01:01:36.919
taking the ministerial information.
People are getting their information

1878
01:01:36.919 --> 01:01:39.252
People are getting their information
from all over the world. I think we

1879
01:01:39.252 --> 01:01:41.002
from all over the world. I think we
are moving into a phase where it is

1880
01:01:41.002 --> 01:01:44.919
are moving into a phase where it is
in the government’s interest to open

1881
01:01:44.919 --> 01:01:46.502
in the government’s interest to open
this up, explain all their thinking

1882
01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:49.044
this up, explain all their thinking
and carry people with them, trying

1883
01:01:49.044 --> 01:01:49.252
and carry peopla with them, trying
tarry

1884
01:01:49.252 --> 01:01:49.377
and carry peopla with them, trying
carry the

1885
01:01:49.377 --> 01:01:50.252
and carry people with them, trying
carry the opposition with them, try

1886
01:01:50.252 --> 01:01:52.544
carry the opposition with them, try
and carry the media with them, but

1887
01:01:52.544 --> 01:01:55.336
and carry the media with them, but
above all try and carry the public.

1888
01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:57.669
above all try and carry the public.
I always found if you treated the

1889
01:01:57.669 --> 01:01:57.794
I always found if you treated the
pub“:

1890
01:01:57.794 --> 01:01:59.544
I always found if you treated the
public like adults, they responded

1891
01:01:59.544 --> 01:02:03.377
public like adults, they responded
like adults. I think George is so

1892
01:02:03.377 --> 01:02:03.961
like adults. I think George is so
right. I am

1893
01:02:03.961 --> 01:02:04.127
like adults. I think George is so
right. lam not

1894
01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:05.544
like adults. I think George is so
right. I am not sure we have been

1895
01:02:05.544 --> 01:02:08.002
right. I am not sure we have been
treating the public, society as

1896
01:02:08.002 --> 01:02:08.169
treating the public, society as
grown-ups.

1897
01:02:08.169 --> 01:02:11.252
treating the public, society as
grown—ups. We have had the slightly

1898
01:02:11.252 --> 01:02:12.002
grown-ups. We have had the slightly
weaselly

1899
01:02:12.002 --> 01:02:13.502
grown—ups. We have had the slightly
weaselly explanations as to what we

1900
01:02:13.502 --> 01:02:15.336
weaselly explanations as to what we
should be doing and capacity and

1901
01:02:15.336 --> 01:02:17.919
should be doing and capacity and
these sorts of things. We are in a

1902
01:02:17.919 --> 01:02:22.044
these sorts of things. We are in a
crisis, we know it is difficult, we

1903
01:02:22.044 --> 01:02:23.919
crisis, we know it is difficult, we
need, for leadership, you need to be

1904
01:02:23.919 --> 01:02:26.377
need, for leadership, you need to be
seen to take on the problems and

1905
01:02:26.377 --> 01:02:28.044
seen to take on the problems and
explain them. I think that is the

1906
01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:28.252
explain them. I think that is the
“Y

1907
01:02:28.252 --> 01:02:30.669
explain them. I think that is the
way through it. I add to that, we

1908
01:02:30.669 --> 01:02:33.544
way through it. I add to that, we
have to act better as a community,

1909
01:02:33.544 --> 01:02:35.252
have to act better as a community,
we have to work together to get this

1910
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:38.919
we have to work together to get this
through. We need proper leadership,

1911
01:02:38.919 --> 01:02:39.502
through. We need proper leadership,
proper transparency,

1912
01:02:39.502 --> 01:02:39.711
through. We need proper leadership,
propertransparency, proper

1913
01:02:39.711 --> 01:02:42.961
propertransparency, proper
communication so we can get to that

1914
01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:43.544
communication so we ran get to that
as a better

1915
01:02:43.544 --> 01:02:45.669
communication so we can get to that
as a better community. We are out of

1916
01:02:45.669 --> 01:02:46.044

Coronavirus is a national emergency,

01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:43.127
life—threatening for people of all
ages, everywhere in the UK.

1961
01:04:43.127 --> 01:04:45.919
To help save lives, stay home.

1962
01:04:45.919 --> 01:04:49.336
Only go outside for food,
health reasons or work,

1963
01:04:49.336 --> 01:04:52.002
but only if you cannot
work from home.

Stay home.

1965
01:04:53.211 --> 01:04:56.252
Anyone can get it,
and anyone can spread it.

1966
01:04:56.252 --> 01:04:57.961
Stay home.

1967
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:01.669
