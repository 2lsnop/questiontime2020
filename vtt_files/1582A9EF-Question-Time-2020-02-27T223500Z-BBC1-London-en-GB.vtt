00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:06.731
A textbook response from Clive
and Pat, who limited

2
00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:09.690
contact with others even
before symptoms arose.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.565
They self—isolated and earlier
travelled to a specialist

4
00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:16.731
NHS unit for a swab.

5
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:20.856
They’ll discover
the results on Monday.

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:22.898
Luke Hanrahan, BBC London.

7
00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:25.815
Well that’s it from me tonight —
now though here’s the weather

8
00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:27.981
with Sarah Keith Lucas.

9
00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:29.106
Good evening.

10
00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:31.273
We saw something of a respite
on Thursday afternoon

11
00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:33.898
into evening with some weather,
but it won’t last too long

12
00:00:33.898 --> 00:00:36.773
as Storm Jorge is set to bring
increasingly wet and windy weather

13
00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:39.731
through Friday and into
the weekend as well.

14
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:43.065
It is dry and clear out there
at the moment, and it’s cold too.

15
00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:44.981
Expect temperatures a few degrees
below freezing first

16
00:00:45.023 --> 00:00:46.023
thing tomorrow morning.

17
00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:48.940
Certainly a touch of frost,
there could be the odd icy stretch.

18
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.356
After that cold, dry start,
the cloud will increase quite

19
00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:53.731
quickly and the rain will move
in from the west.

20
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.690
It will be patchy rain
on and off through the day,

21
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.815
and although temperatures are up
to about 10—11 degrees,

22
00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:01.815
it’ll feel cooler in the breeze.

23
00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:05.231
Here’s an outlook of the weather now
in London over the next seven days.

24
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:10.398
I’ll pass you to Phil Avery to take
you through the national forecast.

25
00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:22.731

44
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:55.398
have heavy rain at times and that is
part of the concern, the Environment

45
00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:58.273
part of the concern, the Environment
Agency will be all over the

46
00:01:58.273 --> 00:01:59.940
Agency will be all over the
situation. Increasingly mild on the

47
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.148
situation. Increasingly mild on the
south—westerly winds but there will

48

south-westerty winds but there will
be planty of

49
00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:03.981
south—westerly winds but there will
be plenty of wind, so it is a double

Let’s take the first question from
Dawn Galloway. Given to the current

Dawn Galloway. Given to the current
strains on the NHS, is the

120
00:05:18.898 --> 00:05:19.690
strains on the NHS, is the
government for a coronavirus

121
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.481
government for a coronavims
pandemic?

122
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.481
government for a coronavirus
pandemic? Figures are going up and

123
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:24.565
pandemic? Figures are going up and
up. jon

124
00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:29.440
pandemic? Figures are going up and
up. Jon Ashworth? Well, it’s an

125
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.690
up. Jon Ashworth? Well, it’s an
excellent question, and that is what

126
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.981
excellent question, and that is what
we are all asking ourselves, aren’t

127
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:37.856
we are all asking ourselves, aren’t
we? Coronavirus now has turned from

128
00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:38.731
we? Coronavims now has turned from
a serious

129
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:39.898
we? Coronavirus now has turned from
a serious service issue for China to

130
00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:40.940
a serious service issue for China to
potentially massive trauma for the

131
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.731
potentially massive trauma for the
world. It’s going to have huge

132
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:46.898
world. It’s going to have huge
impact on the global economy and

133
00:05:46.898 --> 00:05:49.898
impact on the global economy and
probably slow global growth and

134
00:05:49.898 --> 00:05:50.940
probably slow global growth and
trade but, most significantly, it

135
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.606
trade but, most significantly, it
looks like we are now heading for a

136
00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:56.273
looks like we are now heading for a
health crisis, a pandemic, and the

137
00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:58.898
health crisis, a pandemic, and the
World Health Organisation have

138
00:05:58.898 --> 00:06:00.106
World Health Organisation have
warned countries to prepare for a

139
00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:03.065
warned countries to prepare for a
pandemic. Now, our

140
00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:03.231
warned countries to prepare for a
pandemic. Now, ourthoughts

141
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:03.440
pandemic. Now, our thoughts
obviously

142
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.523
pandemic. Now, ourthoughts
obviously have to be with the

143
00:06:05.523 --> 00:06:07.731
obviously have to be with the
patients who have got the virus at

144
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.898
patients who have got the virus at
the moment here, and all the NHS

145
00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:12.481
the moment here, and all the NHS
staff and Public Health England

146
00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:13.440
staff and Public Health England
staff, who are working exceptionally

147
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.273
staff, who are working exceptionally
hard. As it happens, funnily enough,

148
00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:19.106
hard. As it happens, funnily enough,
despite what I normally come on

149
00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.523
despite what I normally come on
these shows and say, I don’t have

150
00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:23.731
these shows and say, I don’t have
any criticism so far of the

151
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:24.565
any criticism so far of the
government and NHS England’s

152
00:06:24.565 --> 00:06:28.315
government and NHS England’s
handling of this crisis. I have been

153
00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:29.940
handling of this crisis. I have been
broadly supportive of the

154
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.898
broadly supportive of the
government’s approach. But the key

155
00:06:30.898 --> 00:06:35.273
government’s approach. But the key
thing is this. We know, after ten

156
00:06:35.273 --> 00:06:36.523
thing is this. We know, after ten
years of cutbacks and austerity, ten

157
00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:39.273
years of cutbacks and austerity, ten
years of cutting over 15,000 beds in

158
00:06:39.273 --> 00:06:42.065
years of cutting over 15,000 beds in
the NHS, ten years of failing to

159
00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:42.273
the NHS, ten years offailing to
recmit

160
00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:43.523
the NHS, ten years of failing to
recruit the staff we need, we are

161
00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:43.815
recmit the staff we need, we are
short of

short of 40,000 nurses, for example,

163
00:06:47.148 --> 00:06:48.565
short of 40,000 nurses, for example,
and we know our NHS is under

and we know our NHS is under
considerable strain let me give you

165
00:06:50.648 --> 00:06:51.773
considerabla strain let me give you
a quick fact,

166
00:06:51.773 --> 00:06:52.648
considerable strain let me give you
a quick fact, the numbers waiting on

167
00:06:52.648 --> 00:06:55.898
a quick fact, the numbers waiting on
a trolley in a corridor in a

168
00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:57.356
a trolley in a corridor in a
hospital because they can’t get a

169
00:06:57.356 --> 00:06:59.731
hospital because they can’t get a
bed, in the last year of the Labour

170
00:06:59.731 --> 00:06:59.898
bed, in the last year of the labour
government,

171
00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:02.440
bed, in the last year of the Labour
government, that was around 61,000.

172
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.773
government, that was around 61,000.
In the last year of this

173
00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:06.023
In the last year of this
Conservative government, it wasn’t

174
00:07:06.023 --> 00:07:09.940
Conservative government, it wasn’t
61,000, it was 850,000. That’s the

175
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.690
61,000, it was 850,000. That’s the
stale

176
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.523
61,000, it was 850,000. That’s the
scale of the deterioration in the

177
00:07:12.523 --> 00:07:14.523
scale of the deterioration in the
NHS under the Tories. Last week, 80%

178
00:07:14.523 --> 00:07:14.898
NHS under the Tories. Last week, 8096
of critical

179
00:07:14.898 --> 00:07:18.315
NHS under the Tories. Last week, 80%
of critical care beds were occupied.

180
00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:18.856
of critical rare beds were occupied.
It meant

181
00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:21.940
of critical care beds were occupied.
It meant that last week there was

182
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.315
It meant that last week there was
around 700 critical care beds free,

183
00:07:24.315 --> 00:07:24.523
around 700 critical rare beds free,
about

184
00:07:24.523 --> 00:07:25.898
around 700 critical care beds free,
about three or four per hospital, so

185
00:07:25.898 --> 00:07:27.815
about three or four per hospital, so
there are now serious questions for

186
00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:30.023
there are now serious questions for
the government that if, and it is

187
00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:32.106
the government that if, and it is
still a big if, if this coronavirus

188
00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:35.023
still a big if, if this coronavirus
hits us and it becomes a pandemic,

189
00:07:35.023 --> 00:07:35.440
hits us and it becomes a pandemic,
randy NHS

190
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.523
hits us and it becomes a pandemic,
candy NHS cope if they don’t put

191
00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:36.731
randy NHS cope if they don’t put
some

192
00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:41.481
candy NHS cope if they don’t put
some extra emergency funding

193
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:43.481
some extra emergency funding
because, at the moment, the NHS is

194
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:44.731
because, at the moment, the NHS is
under huge strain and pressure after

195
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.065
under huge strain and pressure after
years of Tory cutbacks.

196
00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:49.565
years of Tory cutbacks.

So, Nadhim Zahawi, and we were

don’t know if it will, will be NHS

don’t know if it will, will be NHS
cope? We have now been preparing for

211
00:08:15.898 --> 00:08:17.981
cope? We have now been preparing for
a number of weeks. We have a Cobra

212
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:20.190
a number of weeks. We have a Cobra
meeting every week and I am the lead

213
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.440
meeting every week and I am the lead
minister

214
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.815
meeting every week and I am the lead
ministerfor the

215
00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:22.273
meeting every week and I am the lead
minister for the department of

216
00:08:22.273 --> 00:08:23.273
minister for the department of
business because of the critical

217
00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:26.190
business because of the critical
infrastructure for the UK and

218
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.565
infrastructure for the UK and
businesses like the automotive

219
00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:30.273
businesses like the automotive
sector and retail, but the question

220
00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:34.648
sector and retail, but the question
was about the NHS. We have tested

221
00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:38.440
was about the NHS. We have tested
7000 people to date. The NHS has

222
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.481
7000 people to date. The NHS has
been coping incredibly well, and I

223
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.065
been coping incredibly well, and I
pay tribute to the nurses and

224
00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:46.106
pay tribute to the nurses and
doctors and all the staff that have

225
00:08:46.106 --> 00:08:47.565
doctors and all the staff that have
made this possible, so the NHS has

226
00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:52.023
made this possible, so the NHS has
been coping well. But the question

227
00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:53.773
been coping well. But the question
is, if it should get worse, where

228
00:08:53.773 --> 00:08:55.190
is, if it should get worse, where
will the staff and the beds come

229
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:59.773
will the staff and the beds come
from? The reason we have been having

230
00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:02.606
from? The reason we have been having
a Cobra meeting every week, and the

231
00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:04.273
a Cobra meeting every week, and the
Secretary of State for Health as a

232
00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:05.273
Secretary of State for Health as a
Cabinet update every week, and

233
00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:08.273
Cabinet update every week, and
updates the Prime Minister every

234
00:09:08.273 --> 00:09:09.523
updates the Prime Minister every
day, and for example, in my

235
00:09:09.523 --> 00:09:10.898
day, and for example, in my
department, I have stood up a team

236
00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:16.023
department, I have stood up a team
of doing this in every sector every

237
00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:17.481
of doing this in every sector every
day, that’s because we have to make

238
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.815
day, that’s because we have to make
preparations for the worst case

239
00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:21.940
preparations for the worst rase
scenario, it

240
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.731
preparations for the worst case
scenario, it has to be plentiful

241
00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:25.565
scenario, it has to be plantiful
carefully.

242
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:30.398
carefully.
Have we got enough beds? Well, jon

243
00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:30.815
Have we got enough beds? Well, jon
is wrong,

244
00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:33.481
Have we got enough beds? Well, Jon
is wrong, because we got 100,000

245
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.856
is wrong, because we got 100,000
acute beds, and he should know that

246
00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:37.356
acute beds, and he should know that
as shadow minister. Started well by

247
00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.481
as shadow minister. Started well by
saying he was back in the minister

248
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:41.565
saying he was back in the minister
on this issue. Of course, the NHS be

249
00:09:41.565 --> 00:09:44.731
on this issue. Of course, the NHS be
under more pressure, but the reason

250
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:45.856
under more pressure, but the reason
we have made these preparations,

251
00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:47.231
we have made these preparations,
working across the whole of

252
00:09:47.231 --> 00:09:51.231
working across the whole of
government, every department, we are

253
00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:53.231
government, every department, we are
at Cobra every week to do this,

254
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:55.273
at Cobra every week to do this,
that’s because we have been making

255
00:09:55.273 --> 00:09:56.440
that’s because we have been making
these preparations, because you have

256
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.648
these preparations, because you have
to prepare for the best worst case

257
00:09:59.648 --> 00:09:59.856
to prepare for the best worst rase
scenario

258
00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:01.481
to prepare for the best worst case
scenario so we are ready. We have a

259
00:10:01.481 --> 00:10:02.856
scenario so we are ready. We have a
phenomenal team of people in public

260
00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:04.273
phenomenal team of people in public
of England who are doing this work.

261
00:10:04.273 --> 00:10:06.690
of England who are doing this work.
We have to prepare for the best

262
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.148
We have to prepare for the best
worst case scenario, we will be

263
00:10:08.148 --> 00:10:11.731
worst rase scenario, we will be
ready for it. I’m

264
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:12.981
worst case scenario, we will be
ready for it. I’m not wrong on bed

265
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:15.856
ready for it. I’m not wrong on bed
numbers. We have lost about 17,000

266
00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:17.606
numbers. We have lost about 17,000
beds since 2010, and the key thing

267
00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:20.731
beds since 2010, and the key thing
is the critical care beds. They were

268
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:21.106
is the critical rare beds. They were
at 801:

269
00:10:21.106 --> 00:10:23.148
is the critical care beds. They were
at 80% occupancy last week, which

270
00:10:23.148 --> 00:10:23.315
at 8096 occupancy last week, which
meant

271
00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:24.190
at 80% occupancy last week, which
meant there were about 700

272
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.065
meant there were about 700
available. We also have a more

273
00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:28.606
available. We also have a more
serious level of beds, and we only

274
00:10:28.606 --> 00:10:35.023
serious level of beds, and we only
have about 15 of those, Ecmo. On the

275
00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:36.898
have about 15 of those, Ecmo. On the
acute measure you used, your

276
00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:37.106
have about 15 of those, Ecmo. On the
acute measure you used, yourfigures

277
00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:37.481
acute measure you used, your figures
are broadly

278
00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:38.606
acute measure you used, yourfigures
are broadly correct, but most

279
00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:40.481
are broadly correct, but most
hospitals are running at about 95%

280
00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:40.815
hospitals are mnning at about 9596
occupancy on

281
00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:45.731
hospitals are running at about 95%
occupancy on those beds. You should

282
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:48.106
occupancy on those beds. You should
also recognise, in the last five

283
00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.481
also recognise, in the last five
days, what we did was make it the

284
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:52.106
days, what we did was make it the
law of the land that the additional

285
00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:52.231
law of the land that the additional
34

286
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:56.606
law of the land that the additional
3A billion a year of funding will be

287
00:10:56.606 --> 00:10:57.315
34 billion a year offunding will be
there for

288
00:10:57.315 --> 00:10:58.690
3A billion a year of funding will be
there for the NHS. That’s not

289
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.023
there for the NHS. That’s not
enough. You spent ten years running

290
00:11:00.023 --> 00:11:00.398
enough. You spent ten years mnning
down the

291
00:11:00.398 --> 00:11:01.231

jessira would they be isolated. I’m
going to have a

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.565
Jessica would they be isolated. I’m
going to have a go around the

319
00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:50.815
going to have a go around the
audience for other questions,. The

320
00:11:50.815 --> 00:11:54.940
audience for other questions,. The
man behind you. I think we are still

321
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.856
man behind you. I think we are still
thinking in terms of national or

322
00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:57.190
thinking in terms of national or
[oral issue,

323
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.106
thinking in terms of national or
local issue, when it’s really a

324
00:11:58.106 --> 00:11:59.315
local issue, when it’s really a
global thing.

325
00:11:59.315 --> 00:11:59.731
local issue, when it’s really a
globalthing. I believe

326
00:11:59.731 --> 00:12:00.148
local issue, when it’s really a
global thing. I believe that we

327
00:12:00.148 --> 00:12:02.815
global thing. I believe that we
should forget politics for the

328
00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:05.773
should forget politics for the
moment and consider it as a global

329
00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:10.565
moment and consider it as a global
thing and deal with the countries

330
00:12:10.565 --> 00:12:11.731
thing and deal with the countries
and try to tackle this pressure,

331
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.440
and try to tackle this pressure,
rather than just looking at it in

If the NHS is struggling so much,

If the NHS is stmggling so much,
should

If the NHS is struggling so much,
should we not reduce the struggle by

339
00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:32.648
should we not reduce the struggle by
stopping trouble? I’ll take one

340
00:12:32.648 --> 00:12:32.815
stopping troubla? I’ll take one
more.

341
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:34.690
stopping trouble? I’ll take one
more. Where will the staff come from

342
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.148
more. where will the staff come from
to cover

343
00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:37.481
more. Where will the staff come from
to cover the extra workload that

344
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:41.565
to cover the extra workload that
this pandemic might cause? That’s a

345
00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:43.148
this pandemic might cause? That’s a
lot of questions for you. I will go

346
00:12:43.148 --> 00:12:46.648
lot of questions for you. I will go
round the panel first. I think we

347
00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:48.398
round the panel first. I think we
are now at a point where this is

348
00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:49.648
are now at a point where this is
becoming a really serious concern to

349
00:12:49.648 --> 00:12:54.273
becoming a really serious concern to
many people. Particularly to the

350
00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:54.648
many peopla. Particularty to the
elderty or

351
00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:55.231
many people. Particularly to the
elderly or people with existing

352
00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:56.231
elderly or people with existing
health conditions or people with

353
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:56.606
health conditions or peopla with
very young

354
00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:58.898
health conditions or people with
very young children. Although I

355
00:12:58.898 --> 00:13:00.856
very young children. Although I
think preparedness has seemed good

356
00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:02.731
think preparedness has seemed good
so far, there are still stories we

357
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:04.648
so far, there are still stories we
have heard at the Mirror from GP is

358
00:13:04.648 --> 00:13:06.273
have heard at the Mirror from GP is
still uncertain about information to

359
00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:08.981
still uncertain about information to
give out, but generally the

360
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:11.690
give out, but generally the
containment seems to be going well.

361
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.148
containment seems to be going well.
But we know that there is no slack

362
00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:16.315
But we know that there is no slack
in our NHS now. We have had ten

363
00:13:16.315 --> 00:13:17.731
in our NHS now. We have had ten
years where the funding has not been

364
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.690
years where the funding has not been
there. We know that something like

365
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.440
there. We know that something like
25% of people who go into A&E at the

366
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:23.606
2596 of peopla who go into AaE at the
moment

367
00:13:23.606 --> 00:13:25.023
25% of people who go into A&E at the
moment will be on a trolley for more

368
00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:27.398
moment will be on a trolley for more
than four hours. We heard the story

369
00:13:27.398 --> 00:13:29.565
than four hours. We heard the story
the other day about 93—year—old RAF

370
00:13:29.565 --> 00:13:29.981
the other day about 93-year-old RAF
hero who

371
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:31.606
the other day about 93—year—old RAF
hero who had to wait on a trolley

372
00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:33.273
hero who had to wait on a trolley
for 12 hours, so how will we cope

373
00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:36.231
for 12 hours, so how will we cope
with that plus coronavirus, plus if

374
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:36.606
with that plus coronavims, plus if
then we

375
00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:37.648
with that plus coronavirus, plus if
then we have NHS staff becoming ill

376
00:13:37.648 --> 00:13:40.981
then we have NHS staff becoming ill
or having to go into self isolation?

377
00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:44.231
or having to go into self isolation?
This is a major, major concern, but

378
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:46.023
This is a major, major concern, but
you are quite right that perhaps

379
00:13:46.023 --> 00:13:47.731
you are quite right that perhaps
this isn’t quite the time for

380
00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:48.190
this isn’t quite the time for
politic but

381
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.231
this isn’t quite the time for
politics but ensuring the NHS has

382
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:49.440
politic but ensuring the NHS has
exactly

383
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.690

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.731

A pandemic is where something very,

A pandemic is where something very,
very big happens to the world. In

388
00:14:04.898 --> 00:14:07.398
very big happens to the world. In
1919, more people died of influenza

389
00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:07.565
1919, more peopla died of inﬂuenza

than died in the First World War. 50

391
00:14:10.606 --> 00:14:11.148

we are talking

than died in the First World War. 50
we are talking about

we are talking about enormous social

00:14:13.731 --> 00:14:15.565
we are talking about enormous social
movements. This is not

395
00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:16.148
we are talking about enormous social
movements. This is notjust a health

396
00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:18.065

crisis, it is a

397

all of the private medical

all of the private medical
facilities in this country, and

417
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:04.690

of the existing services that are

420
00:15:08.856 --> 00:15:11.731
of the existing services that are
offered by the NHS. We have to look

421
00:15:11.731 --> 00:15:15.356
offered by the NHS. We have to look
beyond it. What do you think should

422
00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:18.648
beyond it. what do you think should
happen, john?

423
00:15:18.648 --> 00:15:19.773

424
00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:20.065
beyond it. What do you think should
happen,John? I mean, I

425
00:15:20.065 --> 00:15:20.856

come on, let’s not exaggerate, but

429
00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:28.106
come on, let’s not exaggerate, but
let’s be honest, we don’t want to

430
00:15:28.106 --> 00:15:29.440
let’s be honest, we don’t want to
exaggerate, we don’t want to look on

431
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.606
exaggerate, we don’t want to look on
it as a breathless crisis. My

432
00:15:32.606 --> 00:15:35.231
it as a breathless crisis. My
brother won’t stay in a hotel in

433
00:15:35.231 --> 00:15:36.815
brother won’t stay in a hotel in
London now because he doesn’t want

434
00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:38.065
London now because he doesn’t want
to catch coronavirus. I mean, that’s

435
00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:41.981
to catch coronavirus. I mean, that’s
a bit silly. But we do have to

436
00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:45.231
a bit silly. But we do have to
nationalise all those facilities in

437
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:46.356
nationalise all those facilities in
and around health, we have to

438
00:15:46.356 --> 00:15:48.940
and around health, we have to
dragoon them in, and look upon it as

439
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:54.231
dragoon them in, and look upon it as
though it is a war, a war on getting

440
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:55.856
though it is a war, a war on getting
rid of this pandemic, and this is

441
00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:58.856
rid of this pandemic, and this is
exactly what happened in 1919, and

442
00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:00.190
exactly what happened in 1919, and
it caused the death of millions and

443
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.440
it caused the death of millions and
millions of people, but the thing

444
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:02.898
millions of peopla, but the thing
was it

445
00:16:02.898 --> 00:16:04.731
millions of people, but the thing
was it was turned around. It’s worth

446
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:11.023
was it was turned around. It’s worth
saying that the death rate for

447
00:16:11.023 --> 00:16:12.190
saying that the death rate for
Spanish flu was way higher,

448
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.273
Spanish flu was way higher,
exponentially higher than we are

449
00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:18.440
exponentially higher than we are
talking about.

450
00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:22.856
talking about. I think we have to
analyse the situation quite coolly,

451
00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:24.481
analyse the situation quite coolly,
because, of course, everyone is

452
00:16:24.481 --> 00:16:25.856
because, of course, everyone is
afraid of the deadly virus, and

453
00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:26.231
afraid of the deadly virus, and
peopla are

454
00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:26.856
afraid of the deadly virus, and
people are panicking and changing

455
00:16:26.856 --> 00:16:28.606
peopla are panicking and changing
their plans,

456
00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:29.231
people are panicking and changing
their plans, people are locking

457
00:16:29.231 --> 00:16:32.231
their plans, people are locking
themselves in their homes. We have

458
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:34.231
themselves in their homes. We have
to remember that, as best we

459
00:16:34.231 --> 00:16:36.731
to remember that, as best we
understand it at the moment, about

460
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:37.065
understand it at the moment, about
801: of

461
00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:38.731
understand it at the moment, about
80% of people are fine. Many of them

462
00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:39.023
8096 of peopla are fine. Many of them
don’t

463
00:16:39.023 --> 00:16:40.398
80% of people are fine. Many of them
don’t even realise they have it,

464
00:16:40.398 --> 00:16:41.606
don’t even realise they have it,
which is one reason it’s so

465
00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:44.190
which is one reason it’s so
difficult to catch. That 15% of

466
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.356
difficult to ratch. That 1596 of
peopla

467
00:16:44.356 --> 00:16:45.440
difficult to catch. That 15% of
people have moderately severe

468
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.565
people have moderately severe
symptoms are not really at risk, and

469
00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:48.940
symptoms are not really at risk, and
about 596

470
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.981
symptoms are not really at risk, and
about 5% are really at risk and

471
00:16:49.981 --> 00:16:50.148
about 596 are really at risk and
under

472
00:16:50.148 --> 00:16:51.731
about 5% are really at risk and
under threat.

473
00:16:51.731 --> 00:16:51.898
about 5% are really at risk and
underthreat. It’s

474
00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:53.148
about 5% are really at risk and
under threat. It’s that 5% we really

475
00:16:53.148 --> 00:16:53.981
under threat. It’s that 596 we really
have to worry

476
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:55.356
under threat. It’s that 5% we really
have to worry about and look after

477
00:16:55.356 --> 00:16:56.356
have to worry about and look after
"TY

478
00:16:56.356 --> 00:16:57.398
have to worry about and look after
very closely, and that’s what the

479
00:16:57.398 --> 00:17:00.981
very closely, and that’s what the
NHS has to be very ready for. The

480
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:01.981
NHS has to be very ready for. The
question is, is the government

481
00:17:01.981 --> 00:17:05.606
question is, is the government
prepared? Effectively, no one was

482
00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:09.356
prepared? Effectively, no one was
prepared for this. There is

483
00:17:09.356 --> 00:17:09.981
prepared for this. There is
generally, I would

484
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:10.440
prepared for this. There is
generally, Iwould imagine, people

485
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.815
generally, Iwould imagine, people
have contingency plans. We had Sars

486
00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:15.648
have contingency plans. We had Sars
and Mars

487
00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:16.981
have contingency plans. We had Sars
and Mers and swine flu, so there is

488
00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:17.773
and Mers and swine ﬂu, so there is
a sense of

489
00:17:17.773 --> 00:17:18.940
and Mers and swine flu, so there is
a sense of people doing something,

490
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.523
a sense of people doing something,
but we all know that the NHS is

491
00:17:21.523 --> 00:17:22.690
but we all know that the NHS is
underinvested and struggling, and we

492
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.106
underinvested and struggling, and we
need to restructure it. We can’t do

493
00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:24.481
need to restmcture it. We can’t do
that this

494
00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:27.356
need to restructure it. We can’t do
that this week. We have to take a

495
00:17:27.356 --> 00:17:29.815
that this week. We have to take a
few emergency measures. You have to

496
00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:33.773
few emergency measures. You have to
look at things like clearing out

497
00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:33.940
look at things like clearing out
possibla

498
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.731
look at things like clearing out
possible beds. For example,

499
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:36.023
possible beds. For example,
sometimes hospital beds are used as

500
00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:39.523
sometimes hospital beds are used as
an alternative to care because there

501
00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:40.731
an alternative to rare because there
are not

502
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:41.106
an alternative to rare because there
are not proper

503
00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:41.815
an alternative to care because there
are not proper care structures in

504
00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:42.606
are not proper rare structures in
place. We need

505
00:17:42.606 --> 00:17:44.315
are not proper care structures in
place. We need to find quick ways to

506
00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:44.773
place. We need to find quick ways to
get rare

507
00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:45.773
place. We need to find quick ways to
get care structures in place so that

508
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:46.440
get rare structures in place so that
hospital beds

509
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.398
get care structures in place so that
hospital beds can be used for the

510
00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:47.773
hospital beds ran be used for the
people that

511
00:17:47.773 --> 00:17:49.148
hospital beds can be used for the
people that need them for this

512
00:17:49.148 --> 00:17:54.731
people that need them for this
crisis situation. However, what I do

513
00:17:54.731 --> 00:17:56.398
crisis situation. However, what I do
think is that what the government

514
00:17:56.398 --> 00:17:58.606
think is that what the government
has done has been quite amazing, in

515
00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.231
has done has been quite amazing, in
terms of giving people the autonomy

516
00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:01.190
terms of giving peopla the autonomy
and ability to

517
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.315
terms of giving people the autonomy
and ability to look after themselves

518
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.148
and ability to look after themselves
in quite an organised way, the whole

519
00:18:04.148 --> 00:18:07.398
in quite an organised way, the whole
drive through testing schemes, call

520
00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:07.731
drive through testing schemes, all
us and

521
00:18:07.731 --> 00:18:09.981
drive through testing schemes, call
us and we will test you at home,

522
00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:12.231
us and we will test you at home,
those things which enable people to

523
00:18:12.231 --> 00:18:12.648
those things which enabla peopla to
look

524
00:18:12.648 --> 00:18:13.773
those things which enable people to
look after themselves, because I

525
00:18:13.773 --> 00:18:16.398
look after themselves, because I
think people in the UK are quite

526
00:18:16.398 --> 00:18:17.356
think people in the UK are quite
responsible about things. They look

527
00:18:17.356 --> 00:18:18.981
responsible about things. They look
after themselves and their

528
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:19.981
after themselves and their
neighbours and families, so it’s

529
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:21.565
neighbours and families, so it’s
giving them the means to do that,

530
00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:24.565
giving them the means to do that,
and that’s been a game changer

531
00:18:24.565 --> 00:18:25.565
and that’s been a game changer
impaired too, for example, Italy,

532
00:18:25.565 --> 00:18:30.023
impaired too, for example, Italy,
which locked the borders very early

533
00:18:30.023 --> 00:18:30.731
which locked the borders very earty
on. But they

534
00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:31.773
which locked the borders very early
on. But they have a lot more cases.

535
00:18:31.773 --> 00:18:33.565
on. But they have a lot more cases.
Let’s put some of these cases back

536
00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:33.690
Let’s put some of these rases back
to

537
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.690
Let’s put some of these cases back
to Nadhim Zahawi. Where will the

538
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.856
to Nadhim Zahawi. where will the
staff

539
00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:38.773
to Nadhim Zahawi. Where will the
staff come from? You asked about

540
00:18:38.773 --> 00:18:41.023
staff come from? You asked about
isolation units, and we have seen

541
00:18:41.023 --> 00:18:42.273
isolation units, and we have seen
some at the beginning. Where will

542
00:18:42.273 --> 00:18:42.398
some at the beginning. where will
the

543
00:18:42.398 --> 00:18:46.940
some at the beginning. Where will
the staff come from?

544
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.940
One strategy is to contain and delay
the vims.

545
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.773
One strategy is to contain and delay
the virus. Then of course, you do

546
00:18:53.773 --> 00:18:54.106
the vims. Then of course, you do
the

547
00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:56.023
the virus. Then of course, you do
the research and mitigate. But where

548
00:18:56.023 --> 00:18:57.856
the research and mitigate. But where
are the stuff coming from? That was

549
00:18:57.856 --> 00:19:03.023
are the stuff coming from? That was
the question.

550
00:19:06.148 --> 00:19:08.190
the question. —— where are the staff

551
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.565
the question. -- where are the staff
coming from?

552
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:13.148
the question. —— where are the staff
coming from? There are already more

553
00:19:13.148 --> 00:19:14.731
coming from? There are already more
staff in the NHS, but we will work

554
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:16.690
staff in the NHS, but we will work
across the whole of the government.

555
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:16.898
across the whole of the government.
where

556
00:19:16.898 --> 00:19:19.106
across the whole of the government.
Where are the extra staff going to

557
00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:19.190
where are the extra staff going to
come

558
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.023
Where are the extra staff going to
come from? I don’t know about the

559
00:19:21.023 --> 00:19:23.648
come from? I don’t know about the
8000 extra nurses, I don’t know if

560
00:19:23.648 --> 00:19:27.190
8000 extra nurses, I don’t know if
that is fewer nurses that would have

561
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.398
that is fewer nurses that would have
left.

562
00:19:27.398 --> 00:19:28.773
that is fewer nurses that would have
left, or actually more nurses. But

563
00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:31.690
left, or actually more nurses. But
should there be an increase in the

564
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.148
should there be an increase in the
number of coronavirus cases, do you

565
00:19:33.148 --> 00:19:36.148
number of coronavirus cases, do you
accept that there will be a need for

566
00:19:36.148 --> 00:19:39.690
accept that there will be a need for
more staff? We plan across

567
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.398
more staff? We plan across
government at Cobra every week. We

568
00:19:42.398 --> 00:19:45.106
government at Cobra every week. We
know that. You can’t magic up staff

569
00:19:45.106 --> 00:19:49.940
know that. You can’t magic up staff
overnight. And the health service is

570
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.148
overnight. And the health service is
well equipped and is dealing with

571
00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:54.898
well equipped and is dealing with
this crisis in a good way. What I am

572
00:19:54.898 --> 00:19:56.315
this crisis in a good way. what I am
trying to say is, if

573
00:19:56.315 --> 00:19:57.898
this crisis in a good way. What I am
trying to say is, if we do get to

574
00:19:57.898 --> 00:19:59.731
trying to say is, if we do get to
the worst—case scenario, we have

575
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.273
the worst-case scenario, we have
plans in place

576
00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:00.856
the worst—case scenario, we have
plans in place across government to

577
00:20:00.856 --> 00:20:06.648
plans in place across government to
make sure we with it.

578
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.898
make sure we with it. Could we bring
in the private sector? We can do

579
00:20:09.898 --> 00:20:10.523
in the private sector? We ran do
lots of things

580
00:20:10.523 --> 00:20:12.398
in the private sector? We can do
lots of things that are available to

581
00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:17.190
lots of things that are available to
us. The question was about working

582
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:22.148
us. The question was about working
internationally on this. The Cobra

583
00:20:22.148 --> 00:20:23.190
internationally on this. The Cobra
team have already put £16

584
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.648
internationally on this. The Cobra
team have already put £45 million to

585
00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:27.106
team have already put £45 million to
work through

586
00:20:27.106 --> 00:20:29.856
team have already put £16 million to
work through the Dfid team to other

587
00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:31.648
work through the Dfid team to other
countries who are not as

588
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:32.940
countries who are not as
well—prepared as we are. Travel

589
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.106
well-prepared as we are. Travel
advice

590
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.398
well—prepared as we are. Travel
advice has also been important. We

591
00:20:34.398 --> 00:20:37.106
advice has also been important. We
have made sure that all our airports

592
00:20:37.106 --> 00:20:42.690
have made sure that all our airports
and ports have clear advice and are

593
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.190
and ports have clear advice and are
monitoring. We are working across

594
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.940
monitoring. We are working across
the board to make sure we are ready

595
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.315
the board to make sure we are ready
if we get to the worst case

596
00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:50.940
if we get to the worst case
scenario. In Venice to the

597
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.898
scenario. In Venice to the
government, they are following the

598
00:20:51.898 --> 00:20:55.690
government, they are following the
advice of the Chief Medical Officer

599
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.106
advice of the Chief Medical Officer
-- in

600
00:20:57.106 --> 00:20:57.690
advice of the Chief Medical Officer
—— infairness

601
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.231
advice of the Chief Medical Officer
—— in fairness to the government.

602
00:20:58.231 --> 00:20:59.231
-- in fairness to the government.
That is why I said

603
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:03.815
—— in fairness to the government.
That is why I said in my remarks

604
00:21:03.815 --> 00:21:05.606
That is why I said in my remarks
that so far, I don’t have a major

605
00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:08.398
that so far, I don’t have a major
criticism of the approach of the

606
00:21:08.398 --> 00:21:09.315
criticism of the approach of the
government, of NHS England and

607
00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:09.523
government, of NHS England and
Pub“:

608
00:21:09.523 --> 00:21:11.481
government, of NHS England and
Public Health England. But as has

609
00:21:11.481 --> 00:21:15.690
Public Health England. But as has
just been exposed, if this does turn

610
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.690
just been exposed, if this does turn
into a pandemic, the government

611
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.023
into a pandemic, the government
dearty have

612
00:21:17.023 --> 00:21:18.231
into a pandemic, the government
clearly have no idea where they will

613
00:21:18.231 --> 00:21:19.273
dearty have no idea where they will
get the staff

614
00:21:19.273 --> 00:21:21.106
clearly have no idea where they will
get the staff for the NHS. We are

615
00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:22.856
get the staff for the NHS. We are
already short of 40,000 thousand

616
00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:24.565
already short of 40,000 thousand
nurses. We are already short of

617
00:21:24.565 --> 00:21:29.523
nurses. We are already short of
resources. 50

618
00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:31.315
nurses. We are already short of
resources. So far, I have been in

619
00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:34.190
resources. So far, I have been in
support of the government and I pay

620
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.731
support of the government and I pay
tribute to the NHS. But if this

621
00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:37.856
tribute to the NHS. But if this
takes a turn for the worse, as we

622
00:21:37.856 --> 00:21:39.273
takes a turn for the worse, as we
have just heard, they have no idea

623
00:21:39.273 --> 00:21:40.731
have just heard, they have no idea
where they will get the staff from

624
00:21:40.731 --> 00:21:46.565
where they will get the staff from
to deal with this. A lot of you

625
00:21:46.565 --> 00:21:47.690
to deal with this. A lot of you
asked about coronavirus, but a lot

626
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.523
asked about coronavims, but a lot
of you also

627
00:21:48.523 --> 00:21:49.815
asked about coronavirus, but a lot
of you also asked about this next

628
00:21:49.815 --> 00:21:51.898
of you also asked about this next
question. Let’s hear

629
00:21:51.898 --> 00:21:52.356
of you also asked about this next
question. Let’s hearfrom Vaughn

630
00:21:52.356 --> 00:21:56.065
question. Let’s hear from Vaughn
Davies. Is

631
00:21:56.065 --> 00:21:56.981
question. Let’s hearfrom Vaughn
Davies. Is the fall in life

632
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:57.731
Davies. Is the fall in life
expectancy proof that austerity

633
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:03.815
expectancy proof that austerity
kills? 50 I think you are referring

634
00:22:03.815 --> 00:22:04.565
kills? So I think you are referring
to a report

635
00:22:04.565 --> 00:22:05.731
kills? 50 I think you are referring
to a report that came out

636
00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:05.898
kills? So I think you are referring
to a report that came out today,

637
00:22:05.898 --> 00:22:08.648
to a report that came out today,
authored by a professor marmot, who

638
00:22:08.648 --> 00:22:10.356
authored by a professor marmot, who
talks about the decrease in life

639
00:22:10.356 --> 00:22:14.565
talks about the decrease in life
expectancy. He said the damage to

640
00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:15.315
expectancy. He said the damage to
health and well—being is

641
00:22:15.315 --> 00:22:16.815
health and well—being is
unprecedented over the last ten

642
00:22:16.815 --> 00:22:18.481
unprecedented over the last ten
years. He also said the damage need

643
00:22:18.481 --> 00:22:19.690
years. He also said the damage need
not have happened and it is

644
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.565
not have happened and it is
shocking. He laid the blame mostly

645
00:22:22.565 --> 00:22:26.648
shocking. He laid the blame mostly
at the door of austerity. Alison?

646
00:22:26.648 --> 00:22:28.356
at the door of austerity. Alison?
This report is one of the most

647
00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:29.940
This report is one of the most
shocking thing is we have read in

648
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.648
shocking thing is we have read in
many years. One of the most striking

649
00:22:35.648 --> 00:22:37.023
many years. One of the most striking
points in the report was that women

650
00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:38.648
points in the report was that women
in some of the most poor areas in

651
00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:40.523
in some of the most poor areas in
the north—east of England are likely

652
00:22:40.523 --> 00:22:41.106
the north-east of England are likely
to die

653
00:22:41.106 --> 00:22:42.231
the north—east of England are likely
to die sooner than they would have

654
00:22:42.231 --> 00:22:45.815
to die sooner than they would have
done ten years ago. This comes on

655
00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:48.815
done ten years ago. This comes on
the back of historically, we have

656
00:22:48.815 --> 00:22:49.940
the back of historically, we have
always found life expectancy

657
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.065
always found life expectancy
increasing. Across the board, people

658
00:22:52.065 --> 00:22:52.731
increasing. Across the board, peopla
who earn

659
00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:54.731
increasing. Across the board, people
who earn more are going to live

660
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:56.148
who earn more are going to live
longer, is the bottom line in this

661
00:22:56.148 --> 00:22:58.856
longer, is the bottom line in this
report. And it does come down to

662
00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:01.773
report. And it does come down to
austerity. It’s a whole combination

663
00:23:01.773 --> 00:23:04.856
austerity. It’s a whola combination
of things in

664
00:23:04.856 --> 00:23:06.023
austerity. It’s a whole combination
of things in many problems now. It

665
00:23:06.023 --> 00:23:07.065
of things in many problams now. It
is not just one

666
00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:08.190
of things in many problems now. It
is notjust one thing, it is a

667
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.440
is notjust one thing, it is a
selection of things. It is poor

668
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.065
selection of things. It is poor
housing, job insecurity, the

669
00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:15.148
housing, job insecurity, the
breakdown of communities, the

670
00:23:15.148 --> 00:23:16.606
breakdown of communities, the
breakdown of essential services. All

671
00:23:16.606 --> 00:23:19.648
breakdown of essential services. All
these things have added to the sense

672
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:20.815
these things have added to the sense
that the people with less will

673
00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:20.940
that the peopla with lass will
suffer

674
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.565
that the people with less will
suffer more. There is a range of

675
00:23:24.565 --> 00:23:25.773
suffer more. There is a range of
other issues going on in our

676
00:23:25.773 --> 00:23:27.731
other issues going on in our
communities as well. There is a

677
00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:30.231
communities as well. There is a
greater sense of isolation and

678
00:23:30.231 --> 00:23:31.565
greater sense of isolation and
mental health issues, but so many of

679
00:23:31.565 --> 00:23:32.981
mental health issues, but so many of
those come back to the knock—on

680
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:33.190
those come back to the knock-on
effects

681
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.940
those come back to the knock—on
effects of austerity and it is ten

682
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.148
effects of austerity and it is ten
years into this now. Yes, we we have

683
00:23:38.148 --> 00:23:39.565
years into this now. Yes, we we have
a government that is committed to

684
00:23:39.565 --> 00:23:41.065
a government that is committed to
doing all sorts of things to make it

685
00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:43.523
doing all sorts of things to make it
better. But the scale of the

686
00:23:43.523 --> 00:23:48.523
better. But the scale of the
problem, which was created by the

687
00:23:48.523 --> 00:23:49.690
problem, which was created by the
Conservative government, is so great

688
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.065
Conservative government, is so great
now and

689
00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:50.940
Conservative government, is so great
new and the damage is so

690
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.523
Conservative government, is so great
now and the damage is so enormous to

691
00:23:52.523 --> 00:23:54.315
now and the damage is so enormous to
people’s lives that I wonder whether

692
00:23:54.315 --> 00:23:55.898
people’s lives that I wonder whether
they have the ability to turn it

693
00:23:55.898 --> 00:23:58.065
they have the ability to turn it
around in the way they have promised

694
00:23:58.065 --> 00:23:59.356
around in the way they have promised
people such as those in the

695
00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:04.523
people such as those in the
north—east who voted for them.

696
00:24:04.523 --> 00:24:08.065
north-east who voted for them.
Ayesha? I

697
00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:09.106
north—east who voted for them.
Ayesha? I think it’s tricky, because

698
00:24:09.106 --> 00:24:09.231
Ayesha? Ithink it’s tricky, because
as

699
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:09.940
Ayesha? Ithink it’s tricky, because
asl

700
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.773
Ayesha? I think it’s tricky, because
as I understand from that report,

701
00:24:10.773 --> 00:24:15.690
as I understand from that report,
Mel --

702
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.731
as I understand from that report,
Mel —— male life expectancy was

703
00:24:16.731 --> 00:24:17.440
Mel -- male life expectancy was
going up, it

704
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.273
Mel —— male life expectancy was
going up, it was women that was

705
00:24:18.273 --> 00:24:22.773
going up, it was women that was
going down. Women are now working a

706
00:24:22.773 --> 00:24:24.731
going down. Women are now working a
lot more and they are often working

707
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:28.606
lot more and they are often working
without enough support with their

708
00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:30.565
without enough support with their
children and they are trying to do

709
00:24:30.565 --> 00:24:33.440
children and they are trying to do
everything. 50 men are getting

710
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:33.773
everything. So men are getting
better,

711
00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:34.648
everything. 50 men are getting
better, women are getting worse.

712
00:24:34.648 --> 00:24:36.440
better, women are getting worse.
That is something to look at. Of

713
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.356
That is something to look at. Of
course we have to think about the

714
00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:40.190
course we have to think about the
impact of austerity, and I agree

715
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.815
impact of austerity, and I agree
with Alison that we have to look at

716
00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.190
with Alison that we have to look at
what has happened to communities and

717
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.565
what has happened to communities and
the fragmentation and the lack of

718
00:24:45.565 --> 00:24:47.940
the fragmentation and the lack of
connection between people, the

719
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.523
connection between people, the
loneliness and unhappiness. As far

720
00:24:49.523 --> 00:24:52.023
loneliness and unhappiness. As far
as the north—east is concerned, life

721
00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:52.440
as the north-east is concerned, life
expectancy for

722
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.148
as the north—east is concerned, life
expectancy for men has gone down. I

723
00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:57.440
expectancy for men has gone down. I
read that for men in some areas, it

724
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.273
read that for men in some areas, it
had gone up, but I accept what you

725
00:24:59.273 --> 00:25:02.773
had gone up, but I accept what you
are saying. But of course, austerity

726
00:25:02.773 --> 00:25:04.606
are saying. But of course, austerity
does have its impact and I think the

727
00:25:04.606 --> 00:25:08.523
does have its impact and I think the
impact on communities has been

728
00:25:08.523 --> 00:25:10.481
impact on communities has been
grave. It is not

729
00:25:10.481 --> 00:25:11.773
impact on communities has been
grave. It is notjust austerity. It

730
00:25:11.773 --> 00:25:12.231
grave. It is not just austerity. It
does

731
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:13.481
grave. It is notjust austerity. It
does combine with other elements

732
00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:14.773
does combine with other elements
like the general fragmentation, like

733
00:25:14.773 --> 00:25:17.023
like the general fragmentation, like
people living in their own homes,

734
00:25:17.023 --> 00:25:17.523
peopla living in their own homes,
watching TV

735
00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:20.106
people living in their own homes,
watching TV and not connecting with

736
00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:21.190
watching TV and not connecting with
peoplc, and

737
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.190
watching TV and not connecting with
people, and the sense of loneliness

738
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.940
people, and the sense of loneliness
and destabilisation and mental

739
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.065
and destabilisation and mental
health, which leads to alcoholism,

740
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:29.023
health, which leads to alcoholism,
dmg abuse,

741
00:25:29.023 --> 00:25:29.898
health, which leads to alcoholism,
drug abuse, unhealthy living and

742
00:25:29.898 --> 00:25:30.106
dmg abuse, unhealthy living and
depression.

743
00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:31.231
drug abuse, unhealthy living and
depression. All of that combined

744
00:25:31.231 --> 00:25:33.106
depression. All of that combined
together and we have to fight all of

745
00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:36.315
together and we have to fight all of
those things at once. Let’s hear

746
00:25:36.315 --> 00:25:37.731
those things at once. Let’s hear
from some of the people in the

747
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:43.023
from some of the people in the
audience. In the north—east, in the

748
00:25:43.023 --> 00:25:43.440
audience. In the north-east, in the
most deprived

749
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.023
audience. In the north—east, in the
most deprived areas, people are

750
00:25:44.023 --> 00:25:48.940
most deprived areas, people are
living five years less than the same

751
00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.690
living five years less than the same
areas in London. That is a huge

752
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.273
areas in London. That is a huge
health injustice. How is the

753
00:25:53.273 --> 00:25:54.356
health injustice. How is the
government proposing to right the

754
00:25:54.356 --> 00:25:58.273
government proposing to right the
wrongs of the last ten years? I know

755
00:25:58.273 --> 00:25:59.356
wrongs of the last ten years? I know
in the north—east, women’s life

756
00:25:59.356 --> 00:25:59.648
in the north-east, women’s life
expectancy

757
00:25:59.648 --> 00:26:02.023
in the north—east, women’s life
expectancy has decreased by almost a

758
00:26:02.023 --> 00:26:04.106
expectancy has decreased by almost a
year in more or less the last ten

759
00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:05.815
year in more or less the last ten
years. In London, it has increased

760
00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:12.523
years. In London, it has increased
by about a year. Yes?

761
00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:18.731
by about a year. Yes? My father was
born in 1920. He died in October

762
00:26:18.731 --> 00:26:22.315
born in 1920. He died in October
last year. He was 99 and three

763
00:26:22.315 --> 00:26:23.690
last year. He was 99 and three
quarters. His brothers and sisters

764
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:29.815
quarters. His brothers and sisters
all lived to a great age. He ate to

765
00:26:29.815 --> 00:26:31.398
all lived to a great age. He ate to
live, he didn’t live to eat. He rode

766
00:26:31.398 --> 00:26:36.398
live, he didn’t live to eat. He rode
a bike. It is people now you don’t

767
00:26:36.398 --> 00:26:40.731
a bike. It is peopla now you don’t
do these things.

768
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:41.065
a bike. It is people now you don’t
do these things. The professor’s

769
00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:42.648
do these things. The professor’s
report blamed mostly austerity, but

770
00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:44.773
report blamed mostly austerity, but
you think it is lifestyles,

771
00:26:44.773 --> 00:26:46.731
you think it is lifestyles,
unconnected to austerity? My father

772
00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:51.065
unconnected to austerity? My father
was born in the 19205, which had

773
00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:53.023
was born in the 19205, which had
austerity and the general strike. He

774
00:26:53.023 --> 00:26:54.981
austerity and the general strike. He
fought in World War II. My

775
00:26:54.981 --> 00:26:55.731
fought in World War II. My

grandfather fought in World War I.
He lived till he was 87. My dad live

779
00:26:59.231 --> 00:27:01.148
He lived till he was 87. My dad live
till. 99. I

780
00:27:01.148 --> 00:27:04.981
He lived till he was 87. My dad live
till 99. I am still here. Sounds

781
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:06.398
till 99. I am still here. Sounds
like you have a very strong gene

782
00:27:06.398 --> 00:27:11.065
like you have a very strong gene
pool there. Yes? The lady behind me

783
00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:12.606
pool there. Yes? The lady behind me
in the white was referring to a

784
00:27:12.606 --> 00:27:13.356
in the white was referring to a
report that came out

785
00:27:13.356 --> 00:27:13.565
in the white was referring to a
report that came outlast

786
00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:13.981
in the white was referring to a
report that came out last year where

787
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:15.273
report that came out last year where
it said that people in the

788
00:27:15.273 --> 00:27:18.481
it said that people in the
north—east actually had lower than

789
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:18.856
north-east actually had lower than
average life

790
00:27:18.856 --> 00:27:19.898
north—east actually had lower than
average life expectancy than in the

791
00:27:19.898 --> 00:27:21.606
average life expectancy than in the
rest of the country. And now on top

792
00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:24.190
rest of the country. And now on top
of that, it is dropping. We are in

793
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.398
of that, it is dropping. We are in
Middlesbrough. I think this city

794
00:27:27.398 --> 00:27:29.981
Middlesbrough. I think this city
scores in the top three worst areas

795
00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:33.356
scores in the top three worst areas
of the country in a number of areas

796
00:27:33.356 --> 00:27:36.856
of the country in a number of areas
of social deprivation. Austerity is

797
00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:39.731
of social deprivation. Austerity is
killing people here. And it’s about

798
00:27:39.731 --> 00:27:42.065
killing people here. And it’s about
time that that was seen,

799
00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:43.523
time that that was seen,
particularly by the Conservative

800
00:27:43.523 --> 00:27:46.106
particularly by the Conservative
government who has been doing this

801
00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:47.898
government who has been doing this
for the last ten years and they take

802
00:27:47.898 --> 00:27:49.981
for the last ten years and they take
action to undo that damage.

803
00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:51.648
action to undo that damage.
Considering the drop in life

804
00:27:51.648 --> 00:27:53.898
Considering the drop in life
expectancy, we can’t take much more.

805
00:27:53.898 --> 00:27:57.356
expectancy, we can’t take much more.
Is this a stain on the record of the

806
00:27:57.356 --> 00:27:59.231
Is this a stain on the record of the
Conservative government, Nadhim? If

807
00:27:59.231 --> 00:28:02.273
Conservative government, Nadhim? If
we are to have a sustainable debate

808
00:28:02.273 --> 00:28:04.190
we are to have a sustainable debate
about this, it’s worth looking at

809
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.481
about this, it’s worth looking at
the evidence us sensibly. Do you

810
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:09.773
the evidence us sensibly. Do you
think these comments have not been

811
00:28:09.773 --> 00:28:13.398
think these comments have not been
sensible? No, on the country. We

812
00:28:13.398 --> 00:28:18.690
sensible? No, on the country. We
have to do much more. But in 2010,

813
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.565
have to do much more. But in 2010,
the Professor’s review then found

814
00:28:21.565 --> 00:28:23.356
the Professor’s review then found
that poorer people in poorer places

815
00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:24.773
that poorer people in poorer places
would die seven years earlier than

816
00:28:24.773 --> 00:28:25.856
would die seven years eartier than
those living in

817
00:28:25.856 --> 00:28:26.481
would die seven years earlier than
those living in the richest places.

818
00:28:26.481 --> 00:28:29.523
those living in the richest places.
He described inequality in health as

819
00:28:29.523 --> 00:28:35.481
He described inequality in health as
unfair. He said there were huge

820
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:37.106
unfair. He said there were huge
discrepancies in life expectancy

821
00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:39.690
discrepancies in life expectancy
between rich and poor. But what is

822
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.648
between rich and poor. But what is
new today is that life expectancy

823
00:28:42.648 --> 00:28:44.981
new today is that life expectancy
overall, which has been increasing

824
00:28:44.981 --> 00:28:48.690
overall, which has been increasing
for hundreds of years, now is

825
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.731
for hundreds of years, now is
showing a decrease and he is blaming

826
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:54.065
showing a decrease and he is blaming
austerity from the last ten years

827
00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.523
austerity from the last ten years
while we had a Conservative

828
00:28:55.523 --> 00:28:56.731
while we had a Conservative
government. Let’s look at the whole

829
00:28:56.731 --> 00:29:01.690
government. Let’s look at the whole
evidence.

830
00:29:03.148 --> 00:29:07.940
evidence. He said it didn’t happen
by chance. I did a bit of research

831
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.315
by chance. I did a bit of research
on this, knowing it would probably

832
00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:11.231
on this, knowing it would probably
come up tonight. And I am not

833
00:29:11.231 --> 00:29:11.565
come up tonight. And I am not
mnning away

834
00:29:11.565 --> 00:29:14.315
come up tonight. And I am not
running away from it. Part of the

835
00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:14.856
mnning away from it. Part of the
reason why we

836
00:29:14.856 --> 00:29:15.898
running away from it. Part of the
reason why we have made it the law

837
00:29:15.898 --> 00:29:17.731
reason why we have made it the law
of the land that we put £35 billion

838
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:17.856
of the land that we put 55 billion
more

839
00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:19.356
of the land that we put £35 billion
more into the NHS is because we have

840
00:29:19.356 --> 00:29:22.398
more into the NHS is because we have
to deal with some of these

841
00:29:22.398 --> 00:29:24.148
to deal with some of these
inequalities. 1A billion more into

842
00:29:24.148 --> 00:29:26.815
inequalities. 1A billion more into
education. The least well off local

843
00:29:26.815 --> 00:29:27.481
education. The least well off local
authorities, we have

844
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:27.815
education. The least well off local
authorities, we havejust announced

845
00:29:27.815 --> 00:29:28.231
authorities, we have just announced
a massive

846
00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:30.940
authorities, we havejust announced
a massive boost for local

847
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.731
a massive boost for local
government, 2.9 billion of

848
00:29:31.731 --> 00:29:33.940
government, 2.9 billion of
additional spending. The least well

849
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.731
additional spending. The least well
off will get 15% more than the more

850
00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:38.315
off will get 1596 more than the more
well off

851
00:29:38.315 --> 00:29:40.106
off will get 15% more than the more
well off local authorities. So yes,

852
00:29:40.106 --> 00:29:40.690
well off [oral authorities. So yes,
there is a

853
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.898
well off local authorities. So yes,
there is a challenge. People in

854
00:29:42.898 --> 00:29:44.690
there is a challenge. People in
Middlesbrough deserved for us to be

855
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.815
Middlesbrough deserved for us to be
better

856
00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:45.023
Middlesbrough deserved for us to be
betterfor

857
00:29:45.023 --> 00:29:45.731
Middlesbrough deserved for us to be
better for them.

858
00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:45.898
Middlesbrough deserved for us to be
betterfor them. Many

859
00:29:45.898 --> 00:29:46.898
Middlesbrough deserved for us to be
better for them. Many people trusted

860
00:29:46.898 --> 00:29:47.231
better for them. Many people tmsted
us with

861
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:48.523
better for them. Many people trusted
us with their vote across the UK and

862
00:29:48.523 --> 00:29:54.606
us with their vote across the UK and
we have to do better. Was the

863
00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:55.606
we have to do better. Was the
austerity policy mistake, then? No.

864
00:29:55.606 --> 00:29:59.523
austerity policy mistake, then? No.
We had to balance the books. Then

865
00:29:59.523 --> 00:30:02.148
We had to balance the books. Then
why are you spending the money now?

866
00:30:02.148 --> 00:30:04.106
why are you spending the money now?
Because there is nothing decent

867
00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:06.356
Because there is nothing decent
about crashing the economy. When

868
00:30:06.356 --> 00:30:09.898
about crashing the economy. When
Venezuela was floating on a lake of

869
00:30:09.898 --> 00:30:10.398
Venezuela was ﬂoating on a lake of
oil, no

870
00:30:10.398 --> 00:30:12.856
Venezuela was floating on a lake of
oil, no Venezuelan should be poor.

871
00:30:12.856 --> 00:30:15.190
oil, no Venezuelan should be poor.
Please don’t make a comparison

872
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.023
Please don’t make a comparison
between Great Britain and Venezuela.

873
00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:22.606
between Great Britain and Venezuela.
That is absolutely ridiculous.

874
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:27.065
That is absolutely ridiculous. Let’s
get the history lesson right. It

875
00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:27.273
get the history lasson right. It
wasn’t

876
00:30:27.273 --> 00:30:29.356
get the history lesson right. It
wasn’t the Conservatives who did

877
00:30:29.356 --> 00:30:30.856
wasn’t the Conservatives who did
this, it was the coalition

878
00:30:30.856 --> 00:30:35.898
this, it was the coalition
government. It was. Our make Nick

879
00:30:35.898 --> 00:30:36.190
government. It was. Our make Nick
Gees

880
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.898
government. It was. Our make Nick
Clegg getting in bed with Cameron.

881
00:30:38.898 --> 00:30:41.398
Clegg getting in bed with Cameron.
And what they did was, they didn’t

882
00:30:41.398 --> 00:30:43.148
And what they did was, they didn’t
realise that the cost of austerity

883
00:30:43.148 --> 00:30:46.690
realise that the cost of austerity
is too much. Austerity is so

884
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.106
is too much. Austerity is so
expensive because not only does it

885
00:30:49.106 --> 00:30:51.731
expensive because not only does it
destroy the lives of people in a

886
00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:53.356
destroy the lives of people in a
community, it affects their minds.

887
00:30:53.356 --> 00:30:56.523
community, it affects their minds.
It affects their well—being. The

888
00:30:56.523 --> 00:30:56.898
It affects their well-being. The
lack of

889
00:30:56.898 --> 00:30:58.731
It affects their well—being. The
lack of libraries, the lack of

890
00:30:58.731 --> 00:31:01.440
lack of libraries, the lack of
schooling, closing down of our high

891
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:07.231
schooling, closing down of our high
streets. All of these things

892
00:31:07.231 --> 00:31:09.648
streets. All of these things
happened, and as a person who has

893
00:31:09.648 --> 00:31:12.565
happened, and as a person who has
worked in this area for more than

894
00:31:12.565 --> 00:31:15.565
worked in this area for more than
the last ten years, on and off over

895
00:31:15.565 --> 00:31:18.856
the last ten years, on and off over
the last 30 years, I can tell you

896
00:31:18.856 --> 00:31:19.565
the last 30 years, I ran tell you
that the

897
00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:20.356
the last 30 years, I can tell you
that the cost of austerity has

898
00:31:20.356 --> 00:31:23.356
that the cost of austerity has
destroyed the community and made

899
00:31:23.356 --> 00:31:24.731
destroyed the community and made
people feel as though there is no

900
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:29.731
peopla feel as though there is no
future.

901
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:38.023
future. If you can’t feel you have
got a future, then it doesn’t matter

902
00:31:38.023 --> 00:31:43.440
got a future, then it doesn’t matter
what a Conservative minister says.

903
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.690
what a Conservative minister says.
The woman in the black headscarf?

The woman in the black headscarf?
Hello, I

Hello, Ijust wanted to also ask, in

906
00:31:50.648 --> 00:31:53.523
Hello, Ijust wanted to also ask, in
your opinion, how much does the

907

Hello, Ijust wanted to also ask, in
your opinion, how much does thejob

908
00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:56.231
your opinion, how much does the job
market at

909
00:31:56.231 --> 00:31:57.815
your opinion, how much does thejob
market at present influence that

910
00:31:57.815 --> 00:32:01.940
market at present influence that
statistic? Which statistic? Life

911
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:07.231
statistic? Which statistic? Life
expectancy going down. To what

912
00:32:07.231 --> 00:32:08.690
expectancy going down. To what
extent does the gig economy, zero

913
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.690
extent does the gig economy, zero
hours, the lack of stability, to

914
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.606
hours, the lack of stability, to
what extent does that affect it as

915
00:32:12.606 --> 00:32:15.023
what extent does that affect it as
well? In my opinion, it is not

916
00:32:15.023 --> 00:32:15.315
what extent does that affect it as
well? In my opinion, it is notjust

917
00:32:15.315 --> 00:32:16.773
well? In my opinion, it is not just
the NHS

918
00:32:16.773 --> 00:32:18.023
well? In my opinion, it is notjust
the NHS and public services, it is

919
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:21.315
the NHS and public services, it is
also the lack of family security,

920
00:32:21.315 --> 00:32:22.815
also the lack of family security,
the knowing how much you are going

921
00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:26.981
the knowing how much you are going
to earn in any given month, being

922
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:27.398
to earn in any given month, being
unabla to

923
00:32:27.398 --> 00:32:29.648
to earn in any given month, being
unable to call in sick because you

924
00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:29.898
unabla to all in sick because you
are

925
00:32:29.898 --> 00:32:33.315
unable to call in sick because you
are technically self—employed. That

926
00:32:33.315 --> 00:32:34.690
are technically self-employed. That
is affecting

927
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.481
are technically self—employed. That
is affecting people as well. The job

928
00:32:36.481 --> 00:32:37.606
is affecting people as well. The job
market today is markedly different

929
00:32:37.606 --> 00:32:41.398
market today is markedly different
to what it was ten years ago and

930
00:32:41.398 --> 00:32:43.065
to what it was ten years ago and
that is affecting people’s health

931
00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:49.565
that is affecting people’s health
and mental health as well.

932
00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:53.731
Why has the Prime Minister gone
exceptionally quiet about issues in

933
00:32:53.731 --> 00:32:56.565
exceptionally quiet about issues in
the north—east? I believe that some

934
00:32:56.565 --> 00:32:57.148
the north-east? I believe that some
of these key

935
00:32:57.148 --> 00:32:57.773
the north—east? I believe that some
of these key issues we are

936
00:32:57.773 --> 00:33:00.398
of these key issues we are
discussing today, he has his vote on

937
00:33:00.398 --> 00:33:04.398
discussing today, he has his vote on
the north—east, but he hasn’t really

938
00:33:04.398 --> 00:33:05.065
the north-east, but he hasn’t really
lived up to

939
00:33:05.065 --> 00:33:05.731
the north—east, but he hasn’t really
lived up to honouring his promise to

940
00:33:05.731 --> 00:33:12.773
lived up to honouring his promise to
us. The man in the checked shirt.

941
00:33:12.773 --> 00:33:13.773
us. The man in the checked shirt.
Surely austerity has had something

942
00:33:13.773 --> 00:33:17.606
Surely austerity has had something
to do with this because, if there

943
00:33:17.606 --> 00:33:19.065
to do with this because, if there
are cuts to children and adults’

944
00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:21.190
are cuts to children and adults’
mental health services, and male

945
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.523
mental health services, and male
suicide is one of the biggest

946
00:33:24.523 --> 00:33:25.731
suicide is one of the biggest
killers for men. Clearly that has

947
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:25.856
killers for men. Cleariy that has
dragged

948
00:33:25.856 --> 00:33:33.148
killers for men. Clearly that has
dragged down the figure. Jon? That

949
00:33:33.148 --> 00:33:33.731
dragged down the figure. jon? That
final point is

950
00:33:33.731 --> 00:33:34.731
dragged down the figure. Jon? That
final point is so important. One

951
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:40.731
final point is so important. One
thing this report found is that what

952
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:42.731
thing this report found is that what
the academics called the mortality

953

original question, the simple answer
to your question is, yes, this

964
00:33:57.231 --> 00:34:00.815
to your question is, yes, this
report is a devastating verdict on

965
00:34:00.815 --> 00:34:02.023
report is a devastating verdict on
ten years of Tory austerity. And

966
00:34:02.023 --> 00:34:09.940
ten years of Tory austerity. And
what this report says... Coalition.

967
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.731
what this report says... Coalition.
There were a lot of toys in there!

There were a lot of toys in there!
what this

There were a lot of toys in there!
What this report says is that life

971
00:34:14.773 --> 00:34:15.065
what this report says is that life
expectancy,

972
00:34:15.065 --> 00:34:16.523
What this report says is that life

are right to say that ten years ago

are right to say that ten years ago
he did a report highlighting health

he did a report highlighting health
inequalities, but in the last ten

years life expectancy has virtually

run backwards the very poorest
women. One part of the country where

984
00:34:37.398 --> 00:34:41.773
women. One part of the country where
it is going backwards, where it is

985

it is going backwards, where it is
most prevalent, is here in the

most prevalent, is here in the
north—east. That is what is going on

987
00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:46.940
north-east. That is what is going on
after ten years

988
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.356
north—east. That is what is going on
after ten years of austerity, and

989
00:34:48.356 --> 00:34:49.065
after ten years of austerity, and
it’s not just

990
00:34:49.065 --> 00:34:49.648
after ten years of austerity, and
it’s notjust about NHS funding,

991
00:34:49.648 --> 00:34:49.815
it’s not just about NHS funding,
it’s

992
00:34:49.815 --> 00:34:51.440
it’s notjust about NHS funding,
it’s about the fact that you have

993
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.815
it’s about the fact that you have
cut liens from children’s and young

994

cut liens from children’s and young
people’sservices, the steepest cuts

995
00:34:56.648 --> 00:34:59.731
people’sservices, the steepest cuts
in the north—east. You have close

in the north-east. You have close
sure start

997
00:35:00.148 --> 00:35:01.398
in the north—east. You have close
sure start centres. It’s about the

998
00:35:01.398 --> 00:35:03.023
sure start centres. It’s about the
fact you have cut benefits so we

999
00:35:03.023 --> 00:35:06.356
fact you have cut benefits so we
have charities reporting of children

1000
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:08.190
have charities reporting of children
scavenging in bins at school, and

1001
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.481
scavenging in bins at school, and
child poverty has gone up to 4

1002
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:12.023
child poverty has gone up to 4
million. You know what? It’s going

1003
00:35:12.023 --> 00:35:14.523
million. You know what? It’s going
to get worse because more cuts are

1004
00:35:14.523 --> 00:35:16.898
to get worse because more cuts are
coming that will push child poverty

1005
00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:17.065
coming that will push child poverty
“P

1006
00:35:17.065 --> 00:35:18.565
coming that will push child poverty
up to a higher level than it was

generations to getting ill quicker

generations to getting ill quicker
in life and dying sooner. That is

1014
00:35:31.398 --> 00:35:32.481
in life and dying sooner. That is
Tory austerity, and I’m afraid you

1015
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:38.023
Tory austerity, and I’m afraid you
should be ashamed. Jon, given all

1016
00:35:38.023 --> 00:35:38.648
should be ashamed. jon, given all
that, why do

1017
00:35:38.648 --> 00:35:41.565
should be ashamed. Jon, given all
that, why do you think you persuaded

00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:42.898
that, why do you think you persuaded
peopla, not in

1019
00:35:42.898 --> 00:35:44.815
that, why do you think you persuaded
people, not in Middlesbrough, but

1020
00:35:44.815 --> 00:35:45.106
peopla, not in Middlasbrough, but
around

1021
00:35:45.106 --> 00:35:48.940
people, not in Middlesbrough, but
around the area to vote? at that

around the area to vote? at that
elaction

1023
00:35:49.106 --> 00:35:50.731
around the area to vote? at that
election was devastating for the

elaction was devastating for the
labour

1025
00:35:50.856 --> 00:35:51.856
election was devastating for the
Labour Party. We got hammered, and

1026
00:35:51.856 --> 00:35:52.523
labour Party. We got hammered, and
there were

1027
00:35:52.523 --> 00:35:54.398
Labour Party. We got hammered, and
there were seats like north—west

there were seats like north-west

of the constituencies that went from

of the constituencies that went from
Labour to Tory are the

1042
00:36:15.356 --> 00:36:16.148
Labour to Tory are the
constituencies where these health

1043
00:36:16.148 --> 00:36:17.190
constituencies where these health
inequalities are getting wider and

1044
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.023
inequalities are getting wider and
wider. I used to come on your

1045
00:36:21.023 --> 00:36:23.231
wider. I used to come on your
programme and speak with great

1046
00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:24.856
programme and speak with great
eloquence, I hope, about the state

1047
00:36:24.856 --> 00:36:26.606
eloquence, I hope, about the state
of things, but we didn’t convince

1048
00:36:26.606 --> 00:36:27.106
of things, but we didn’t convince
peopla.

1049
00:36:27.106 --> 00:36:28.940
of things, but we didn’t convince
people. We are having a leadership

1050
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.190
people. We are having a leadership
election, as you know, and hopefully

1051
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.731
election, as you know, and hopefully
with a new leader in place we will

1052
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:33.398
with a new leader in place we will
be able to get out there and can

daim again

1055
00:36:33.731 --> 00:36:36.773
be able to get out there and can
claim again and rebuild. We have a

1056
00:36:36.773 --> 00:36:38.190
claim again and rebuild. We have a
big challenge on our hands and I

1057
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.398
big challenge on our hands and I
have to accept that, and we have to

1058
00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:42.190
have to accept that, and we have to
understand why we felt people so

1059
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.606
understand why we felt people so
badly, because we did in this part

1060
00:36:43.606 --> 00:36:45.356
badly, because we did in this part
of the world, and we cannot allow

of the world, and we cannot allow
that

of the world, and we rannot allow
that again,

1063
00:36:46.023 --> 00:36:47.148
of the world, and we cannot allow
that again, because I want a Labour

1064
00:36:47.148 --> 00:36:47.606
that again, because I want a labour
government to

1065
00:36:47.606 --> 00:36:49.606
that again, because I want a Labour
government to deal with child

1066
00:36:49.606 --> 00:36:50.190
government to deal with child
poverty.

1067
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.481

1071
00:36:56.148 --> 00:36:58.898
my party cannot continue failing to

do that. Is an example of a labour
government in

do that. Is an example of a Labour
government in Wales, and life

1074
00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:01.106
government in Wales, and life
expectancy has increased much more

1075
00:37:01.106 --> 00:37:03.565
expectancy has increased much more
quickly in England than in Wales.

Labour run Wales have risen, despite

Scotland. This is not a party
political point. Scotland is doing

1084

political point. Scotland is doing

there are more children in poverty

1108
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:58.273
there are more children in poverty
because of your policies. Hang on, I

1109
00:37:58.273 --> 00:38:00.731
because of your policies. Hang on, I
am getting deafened. The one thing I

1110
00:38:00.731 --> 00:38:03.356
am getting deafened. The one thing I
don’t think you did, and Hamza

1111

don’t think you did, and Hamu
Howie, was

1112
00:38:03.731 --> 00:38:04.940
don’t think you did, and Hamza
Howie, was answer the question. Is

1113
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.315
Howie, was answer the question. Is
the fall in life expectancy proof

1114
00:38:09.315 --> 00:38:10.940
the fall in life expectancy proof
that austerity kills, is the author

1115
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.773
that austerity kills, is the author
of the report suggests? Is it proof?

1116
00:38:15.773 --> 00:38:18.190
of the report suggests? Is it proof?
I don’t agree with Lord bird’s

1117
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:23.940
I don’t agree with Lord bird’s
point... Is it proof or isn’t it? We

1118
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.981
point... Is it proof or isn’t it? We
had to balance the books. You didn’t

1119
00:38:27.981 --> 00:38:30.606
had to balance the books. You didn’t
have to balance the books. If you

1120
00:38:30.606 --> 00:38:31.815
have to balance the books. If you
crash the economy, you hurt the

1121
00:38:31.815 --> 00:38:36.065
crash the economy, you hurt the
weakness. This is rubbish! There are

1122
00:38:36.065 --> 00:38:37.690
weakness. This is rubbish! There are
a whole group of people who say that

1123
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.231
a whola group of peopla who say that
you ran trade

1124
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:39.981
a whole group of people who say that
you can trade out of austerity. We

1125
00:38:39.981 --> 00:38:40.356
you ran trade out of austerity. We
went into

1126
00:38:40.356 --> 00:38:41.398
you can trade out of austerity. We
went into the Second World War with

1127
00:38:41.398 --> 00:38:43.440
went into the Second World War with
not a penny in our pockets and, by

1128
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.773
not a penny in our pockets and, by
the end of it, we created an economy

1129
00:38:48.773 --> 00:38:52.648
the end of it, we created an economy
where, if you borrow, spend to save.

1130
00:38:52.648 --> 00:38:54.398
where, if you borrow, spend to save.
That is the answer. And you, for

1131
00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.940
That is the answer. And you, for
ideological reasons, went down the

1132
00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.773
ideological reasons, went down the
road of what we are going to do is

1133
00:38:58.773 --> 00:39:00.731
road of what we are going to do is
live within our Thatcherite means,

1134
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:03.190
live within our Thatcherite means,
and that helped to destroy the

1135
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:08.606
and that helped to destroy the
prosperity of Britain. We borrowed

1136
00:39:08.606 --> 00:39:10.106
prosperity of Britain. We borrowed
our way out of it in the Second

1137
00:39:10.106 --> 00:39:13.023
our way out of it in the Second
World War. For every £4 we were

1138
00:39:13.023 --> 00:39:17.690
World War. For every £4 we were
spending, we were borrowing a plan.

1139
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.606
spending, we were borrowing a plan.
Today, for every £22 we spent, we

1140
00:39:19.606 --> 00:39:24.023
Today, for every £22 we spent, we
borrow a pound. That is responsible.

1141
00:39:24.023 --> 00:39:29.856
borrow a pound. That is responsible.
THEY SPEAK OVER EACH OTHER.

1142
00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:32.898
THEY SPEAK OVER EACH OTHER.
Austerity is not the answer to every

1143
00:39:32.898 --> 00:39:35.940
Austerity is not the answer to every
problem in the world. Our society

1144
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.065
problem in the world. Our society
has become more decadent and

1145
00:39:37.065 --> 00:39:38.898
has become more decadent and
developed, and you seem again and

1146
00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:39.898
developed, and you seem again and
again people become more secondary

1147
00:39:39.898 --> 00:39:40.731
again peopla become more secondary
and

1148
00:39:40.731 --> 00:39:41.523
again people become more secondary
and depressed, communities become

1149
00:39:41.523 --> 00:39:46.315
and depressed, communities become
more fragmented, they would turn

1150
00:39:46.315 --> 00:39:48.731
more fragmented, they would turn
more to abusive substances that make

1151
00:39:48.731 --> 00:39:51.356
more to abusive substances that make
them ill. As the lady over there was

1152
00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:51.940
them ill. As the lady over there was
saying, her

1153
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.315
them ill. As the lady over there was
saying, herfamily went

1154
00:39:52.315 --> 00:39:52.648
them ill. As the lady over there was
saying, her family went through all

1155
00:39:52.648 --> 00:39:55.273
saying, her family went through all
kinds of probation and suffering,

1156
00:39:55.273 --> 00:39:56.856
kinds of probation and suffering,
they are as strong as Oxis. It’s a

1157
00:39:56.856 --> 00:39:59.940
they are as strong as Oxis. It’s a
far more complex question. The world

1158
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.273
far more complex question. The world
is changing, and austerity is not a

1159
00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:06.231
is changing, and austerity is not a
silver bullet. That is what the

1160
00:40:06.231 --> 00:40:06.648
silver bullet. That is what the
author of

1161
00:40:06.648 --> 00:40:07.731
silver bullet. That is what the
author of the report said, and he

1162
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:11.273
author of the report said, and he
blamed austerity. Next week, we will

1163
00:40:11.273 --> 00:40:12.898
blamed austerity. Next week, we will
be in Tunbridge Wells, and the

1164
00:40:12.898 --> 00:40:14.940
be in Tunbridge Wells, and the
following week is Budget weak and we

1165
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.273
following week is Budget weak and we
will be in West Bromwich. If you

1166
00:40:16.273 --> 00:40:18.481
will be in West Bromwich. If you
want to come and be in the audience,

1167
00:40:18.481 --> 00:40:19.148
want to come and be in the audience,
all us on

1168
00:40:19.148 --> 00:40:20.315
want to come and be in the audience,
callus on this number or go to the

1170
00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:26.690
ﬂ

1171
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.106
I think we can talk about that

1172
00:40:28.106 --> 00:40:28.731
I think we ran talk about that
report in the

1173
00:40:28.731 --> 00:40:30.148
I think we can talk about that
report in the north probably for the

1174
00:40:30.148 --> 00:40:31.940
report in the north probably for the
whole hour, but there are a lot of

1175
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.315
whole hour, but there are a lot of
other questions, so in fairness I am

1176
00:40:33.315 --> 00:40:38.231
other questions, so in fairness I am
going to move on and take a question

1177
00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:40.606
going to move on and take a question
from Raymond Latus. After today’s

1178
00:40:40.606 --> 00:40:40.981
from Raymond latus. After todars
court ruling,

1179
00:40:40.981 --> 00:40:41.398
from Raymond Latus. After today’s
court ruling, should Heathrow

1180
00:40:41.398 --> 00:40:42.231
court ruling, should Heathrow
expansion go—ahead for trade

1181
00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:44.565
expansion go—ahead for trade
benefits or be stopped for

1182
00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:47.773
benefits or be stopped for
environmental reasons? Right, you

1183
00:40:47.773 --> 00:40:50.856
environmental reasons? Right, you
supported a third runway? So should

1184
00:40:50.856 --> 00:40:54.315
supported a third runway? So should
it go ahead?

1185
00:40:54.315 --> 00:40:55.815
supported a third runway? 50 should
it go ahead? Well, I think we need

1186
00:40:55.815 --> 00:40:56.815
it go ahead? Well, I think we need
to aviation investment in this

1187
00:40:56.815 --> 00:40:59.815
to aviation investment in this
country. The same time, we need to

1188
00:40:59.815 --> 00:41:01.106
country. The same time, we need to
make sure we meet our climate

1189
00:41:01.106 --> 00:41:04.315
make sure we meet our climate
challenge of net zero by 2050. I am

1190
00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:07.231
challenge of net zero by 2050. I am
the Business Minister, so a couple

1191
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:12.856
the Business Minister, so a couple
of weeks ago I had a roundtable with

1192
00:41:12.856 --> 00:41:14.065
of weeks ago I had a roundtable with
the Prince of Wales, the whole

1193
00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:15.315
the Prince of Wales, the whole
aviation industry, and we are

1194
00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:16.940
aviation industry, and we are
looking to target to produce an

1195
00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:21.315
looking to target to produce an
aircraft that can carry 180 people

1196
00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:22.023
aircraft that ran rarry180 peopla
to a 500

1197
00:41:22.023 --> 00:41:23.315
aircraft that can carry 180 people
to a 500 mile radius, so it covers

1198
00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:24.731
to a 500 mile radius, so it covers
most of Europe, which will be fully

1199
00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:27.356
most of Europe, which will be fully
elactric.

1200
00:41:27.356 --> 00:41:28.398
most of Europe, which will be fully
electric. So will a third runway

1201
00:41:28.398 --> 00:41:31.690
elactric. So will a third runway
go-ahead?

1202
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:32.523
electric. So will a third runway
go—ahead? Heathrow is a private

1203
00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:32.898
go-ahead? Heathrow is a private
country, and

1204
00:41:32.898 --> 00:41:35.523
go—ahead? Heathrow is a private
country, and that investment is

1205
00:41:35.523 --> 00:41:39.315
country, and that investment is
being made by a private company. ——

private company. The legal challenge

1208
00:41:41.731 --> 00:41:43.106
private company. The legal challenge
today was successful, so I would not

1209
00:41:43.106 --> 00:41:44.315
today was successful, so I would not
want to comment on the legal

1210
00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:47.773
want to comment on the legal
situation. The view of the

1211
00:41:47.773 --> 00:41:49.440
situation. The view of the
government is that aviation is

1212
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.565
government is that aviation is
incredibly important. In our

1213
00:41:51.565 --> 00:41:53.523
incredibly important. In our
levelling up, the question is, is it

1214
00:41:53.523 --> 00:41:55.648
levelling up, the question is, is it
important for trade? And it is. Nick

1215
00:41:55.648 --> 00:42:02.023
important for trade? And it is. Nick
should it go ahead? After today’s

1216
00:42:02.023 --> 00:42:03.398
should it go ahead? After todars
court ruling,

1217
00:42:03.398 --> 00:42:03.856
should it go ahead? After today’s
court ruling, should Heathrow

1218
00:42:03.856 --> 00:42:05.898
court ruling, should Heathrow
expansion go—ahead for trade

1219
00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:08.440
expansion go—ahead for trade
benefits. For environmental reasons?

1220
00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:08.856
benefits. For environmental reasons?
with

1221
00:42:08.856 --> 00:42:09.731
benefits. For environmental reasons?
With Heathrow and the legal

1222
00:42:09.731 --> 00:42:14.356
With Heathrow and the legal
challenge, I can’t comment on that.

1223
00:42:14.356 --> 00:42:14.606
challange, I can’t comment on that.
For

1224
00:42:14.606 --> 00:42:15.440
challenge, I can’t comment on that.
For aviation across the UK,

1225
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.856
For aviation across the UK,
absolutely, we need to invest in it

1226
00:42:16.856 --> 00:42:19.898
absolutely, we need to invest in it
as well as to meet our very, very

1227
00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:21.106
as well as to meet our very, very
ambitious targets for net zero by

1228
00:42:21.106 --> 00:42:24.898
ambitious targets for net zero by
2050. We will be co—chairing COP26,

1229
00:42:24.898 --> 00:42:25.106
2050. We will be co-chairing (ions,
the

1230
00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:28.731
2050. We will be co—chairing COP26,
the climate summit, in Glasgow this

1231
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:30.315
the climate summit, in Glasgow this
year, the end of the year, and we

1232

have to make sure we do both of

have to make sure we do both of
those things and do them well. A lot

1234
00:42:34.106 --> 00:42:35.523
those things and do them well. A lot
of the innovation is happening

1235
00:42:35.523 --> 00:42:37.440
of the innovation is happening
within my department, and we are

1236
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.398
within my department, and we are
investing to make sure we have

1237
00:42:39.398 --> 00:42:42.856
investing to make sure we have
sustainable, clean aviation. I hear

1238
00:42:42.856 --> 00:42:43.523
sustainable, dean aviation. I hear
that, but

1239
00:42:43.523 --> 00:42:43.731
sustainable, dean aviation. I hear
that, butl

1240
00:42:43.731 --> 00:42:44.731
sustainable, clean aviation. I hear
that, but I also hear you are not

1241
00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:46.940
that, but I also hear you are not
answering the question. I said

1242
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.690
answering the question. I said
aviation has to grow. You are saying

1243
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.106
aviation has to grow. You are saying
you don’t have a view on Heathrow

1244
00:42:52.106 --> 00:42:56.523
you don’t have a view on Heathrow
expanding! I think the environment

1245
00:42:56.523 --> 00:42:58.023
expanding! I think the environment
or site is extremely important and

1246
00:42:58.023 --> 00:42:58.481
or site is extremely important and
dearty we

1247
00:42:58.481 --> 00:42:59.065
or site is extremely important and
clearly we need do something

1248
00:42:59.065 --> 00:43:03.106
dearty we need do something
regarding

1249
00:43:03.106 --> 00:43:04.106
clearly we need do something
regarding that, and we shouldn’t

1250
00:43:04.106 --> 00:43:05.523
regarding that, and we shouldn’t
underplay how serious that

1251
00:43:05.523 --> 00:43:06.940
underplay how serious that
challenges for the globe, but

1252
00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.523
challenges for the globe, but
personally I think it should go

1253
00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:10.398
personally I think it should go
ahead because, without a strong

1254
00:43:10.398 --> 00:43:11.523
ahead because, without a strong
economy, without the investment

1255
00:43:11.523 --> 00:43:15.273
economy, without the investment
needed to sustain that future, we

1256
00:43:15.273 --> 00:43:18.023
needed to sustain that future, we
won’t have that environment. The

1257
00:43:18.023 --> 00:43:23.523
won’t have that environment. The
woman in the middle. Does Gatwick

1258
00:43:23.523 --> 00:43:25.731
woman in the middle. Does Gatwick
Airport not reduce the emissions if

1259
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:27.690
Airport not reduce the emissions if
you move it there? Did I read that

1260
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:32.315
you move it there? Did I read that
today? We are checking that. If

1261
00:43:32.315 --> 00:43:36.023
today? We are checking that. If
there is to be any investment,

1262
00:43:36.023 --> 00:43:37.690
there is to be any investment,
should not be in the north—east, one

1263
00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:38.273
should not be in the north-east, one
of the most

1264
00:43:38.273 --> 00:43:39.023
should not be in the north—east, one
of the most deprived areas of the

1265
00:43:39.023 --> 00:43:40.106
of the most deprived areas of the
country? --

1266
00:43:40.106 --> 00:43:43.023
of the most deprived areas of the
country? —— should it not be.

1267
00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:46.190
country? -- should it not be.
Alison? I

1268
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.315
country? —— should it not be.
Alison? I think today might go down

1269
00:43:47.315 --> 00:43:48.940
Alison? I think today might go down
as a really key date in this

1270
00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.481
as a really key date in this
country, in its fightback for our

1271
00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:55.731
country, in its fightback for our
planet, really. What this legal

1272
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:56.190
planet, really. what this legal
mling has

1273
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:57.315
planet, really. What this legal
ruling has meant is that any big

1274
00:43:57.315 --> 00:43:57.690
mling has meant is that any big
project now

1275
00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.565
ruling has meant is that any big
project now is going to have to have

1276
00:44:00.565 --> 00:44:01.356
project now is going to have to have
some consideration about the

1277
00:44:01.356 --> 00:44:02.690
some consideration about the
environmental impact, and we cannot

1278
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.481
environmental impact, and we rannot
just pretend this

1279
00:44:05.481 --> 00:44:05.773
environmental impact, and we cannot
just pretend this stuff isn’t

1280
00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:07.106
just pretend this stuff isn’t
happening now. We have seen the

1281
00:44:07.106 --> 00:44:07.273
happening now. We have seen the
ﬂoods

1282
00:44:07.273 --> 00:44:10.065
happening now. We have seen the
floods of the last few weeks.

1283
00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:11.273
floods of the last few weeks.
Elsewhere in the world, they have

1284
00:44:11.273 --> 00:44:13.065
Elsewhere in the world, they have
seen this kind of thing for years,

1285
00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:15.106
seen this kind of thing for years,
and now it’s on our own front door,

1286
00:44:15.106 --> 00:44:17.898
and now it’s on our own front door,
we cannot ignore it. We also have to

1287
00:44:17.898 --> 00:44:18.065
we cannot ignore it. We also have to
think

1288
00:44:18.065 --> 00:44:19.898
we rannot ignore it. We also have to
think that

1289
00:44:19.898 --> 00:44:22.606
we cannot ignore it. We also have to
think that sometimes, yes, we need a

1290
00:44:22.606 --> 00:44:24.565
think that sometimes, yes, we need a
strong economy, yes, we need jobs,

1291
00:44:24.565 --> 00:44:25.565
strong economy, yes, we need jobs,
and there are lots of

1292
00:44:25.565 --> 00:44:26.731
strong economy, yes, we need jobs,
and there are lots ofjobs to be had

1293
00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:28.148
and there are lots ofjobs to be had
in the green industries, and lots of

1294
00:44:28.148 --> 00:44:29.940
in the green industries, and lots of
money to be made, but the people who

1295
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.106
money to be made, but the peopla who
mn this country

1296
00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:32.648
money to be made, but the people who
run this country have got to say,

1297
00:44:32.648 --> 00:44:33.273
mn this country have got to say,
you know

1298
00:44:33.273 --> 00:44:34.731
run this country have got to say,
you know what, sometimes things are

1299
00:44:34.731 --> 00:44:37.148
you know what, sometimes things are
more important than money, like our

1300
00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:38.731
more important than money, like our
children’s futures, our communities,

1301
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:39.898
children’s futures, our communities,
there are things that matter more

1302
00:44:39.898 --> 00:44:42.565
there are things that matter more
than making money, and I think it

1303
00:44:42.565 --> 00:44:43.315
than making money, and Ithink it
leaves us

1304
00:44:43.315 --> 00:44:44.148
than making money, and I think it
leaves us in a difficult position,

1305
00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:46.148
leaves us in a difficult position,
because we know the Prime Minister

1306
00:44:46.148 --> 00:44:47.731
because we know the Prime Minister
must review on Heathrow was that he

1307
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:47.815
must review on Heathrow was that he
would

1308
00:44:47.815 --> 00:44:48.315
must review on Heatth was that he
would lay down

1309
00:44:48.315 --> 00:44:48.898
must review on Heathrow was that he
would lay down in front of

1310
00:44:48.898 --> 00:44:55.106
would lay down in front of
bulldozers. This is a really big

1311
00:44:55.106 --> 00:44:56.898
bulldozers. This is a really big
step forward for this country, as we

1312
00:44:56.898 --> 00:44:58.356
step forward for this country, as we
finally make a stand about what is

1313
00:44:58.356 --> 00:44:59.565
finally make a stand about what is
right for our future and our

1314
00:44:59.565 --> 00:45:04.981
right for our future and our
children’s futures. John Bird. Are

1315
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:05.523
children’s futures. john Bird. Are
used to

1316
00:45:05.523 --> 00:45:06.523
children’s futures. John Bird. Are
used to live under the flight path,

1317
00:45:06.523 --> 00:45:07.231
used to live under the ﬂight path,
so I

1318
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:11.440
used to live under the flight path,
so I suffered. It’s a terrible place

1319
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.023
so I suffered. It’s a terrible place
to live if you live down on the

1320
00:45:13.023 --> 00:45:15.523
to live if you live down on the
Thames Valley there, with all the

1321
00:45:15.523 --> 00:45:17.940
Thames Valley there, with all the
aeroplanes coming in and even more,

1322
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.690
aeroplanes coming in and even more,
but I think the real issue to me,

1323
00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.440
but I think the real issue to me,
and it’s why I’ve got a bill going

1324
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.523
and it’s why I’ve got a bill going
through

1325
00:45:24.523 --> 00:45:24.731
and it’s why I’ve got a hill going
through the

1326
00:45:24.731 --> 00:45:25.356
and it’s why I’ve got a bill going
through the house called the

1327
00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:26.065
through the house called the
wellbeing of future generations

1328
00:45:26.065 --> 00:45:28.523
wellbeing of future generations
bill, and this is to try and get

1329
00:45:28.523 --> 00:45:31.648
bill, and this is to try and get
governments to grow up about not

1330
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:36.315
governments to grow up about not
doing short—term things. It’s a

1331
00:45:36.315 --> 00:45:36.481
doing short-term things. It’s a
really

1332
00:45:36.481 --> 00:45:39.065
doing short—term things. It’s a
really interesting and exciting idea

1333
00:45:39.065 --> 00:45:43.106
really interesting and exciting idea
to have runway number three, because

1334
00:45:43.106 --> 00:45:45.606
to have runway number three, because
it’s short—term real boost to the

1335
00:45:45.606 --> 00:45:46.023
it’s short-term real boost to the
economy, very

1336
00:45:46.023 --> 00:45:46.565
it’s short—term real boost to the
economy, very quickly, but the

1337
00:45:46.565 --> 00:45:47.856
economy, very quickly, but the
long-term

1338
00:45:47.856 --> 00:45:48.481
economy, very quickly, but the
long—term effects are just

1339
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:53.690
long—term effects are just
devastating. You don’t want to be

1340
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:54.690
devastating. You don’t want to be
enlarging Heathrow. You don’t want

1341
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.481
enlarging Heathrow. You don’t want
to be enlarging all of the other

1342
00:45:56.481 --> 00:46:00.273
to be enlarging all of the other
airports around the country with the

1343
00:46:00.273 --> 00:46:01.856
airports around the country with the
present technology. You need to be

1344
00:46:01.856 --> 00:46:05.898
present technology. You need to be
putting your money and your effort,

1345
00:46:05.898 --> 00:46:06.856
putting your money and your effort,
like the American government are

1346
00:46:06.856 --> 00:46:09.190
like the American government are
doing, putting an enormous amount of

1347
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.273
doing, putting an enormous amount of
effort, especially in the military,

1348
00:46:10.273 --> 00:46:14.315
effort, especially in the military,
around how to produce clean planes.

1349
00:46:14.315 --> 00:46:14.690
around how to produce dean planes.
That kind

1350
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.940
around how to produce clean planes.
That kind of money is not being put

1351
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.731
That kind of money is not being put
in by their majesties government and

1352
00:46:18.731 --> 00:46:19.898
in by their majesties government and
has never really been seriously put

1353
00:46:19.898 --> 00:46:22.690
has never really been seriously put
in. If we want to do something

1354
00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.981
in. If we want to do something
sensible, we need to stop this

1355
00:46:24.981 --> 00:46:28.106
sensible, we need to stop this
generation destroying the next

1356
00:46:28.106 --> 00:46:30.731
generation destroying the next
generation, so that the next

1357
00:46:30.731 --> 00:46:32.148
generation, so that the next
generation has a poorer quality of

1358
00:46:32.148 --> 00:46:33.981
generation has a poorer quality of
life, and I think that is the real

1359
00:46:33.981 --> 00:46:37.690
life, and I think that is the real
issue around whether we vote for a

1360
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:41.731
issue around whether we vote for a
third runway. I would not go for a

1361
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:43.106
third runway. I would not go for a
third runway. I’d spent the money on

1362
00:46:43.106 --> 00:46:46.231
third runway. I’d spent the money on
our schools and on our libraries and

1363
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:48.148
our schools and on our libraries and
on our community in the north—east

1364
00:46:48.148 --> 00:46:48.731
on our community in the north-east
of England, and

1365
00:46:48.731 --> 00:46:50.356
on our community in the north—east
of England, and give our children

1366
00:46:50.356 --> 00:46:54.356
of England, and give our children
the opportunity of having jobs which

1367
00:46:54.356 --> 00:46:56.731
the opportunity of having jobs which
are not 5p, £10 an hour, but £50 an

1368
00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:57.148
are not 5p, £10 an hour, but 50 an
hour. If

1369
00:46:57.148 --> 00:46:58.315
are not So, £10 an hour, but 50 an
hour. If you are

1370
00:46:58.315 --> 00:46:59.731
are not 5p, £10 an hour, but £50 an
hour. If you are going to get

1371
00:46:59.731 --> 00:47:01.190
hour. If you are going to get
somebody out of poverty, give them a

1372
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.731
somebody out of poverty, give them a
bloody good job.

1373
00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:04.731
bloody good job.

Yes. I am

Yes. lam really concerned

APPLAUSE
Yes. I am really concerned about

1377
00:47:11.898 --> 00:47:12.356
Yes. I am really concerned about
[oral transport

1378
00:47:12.356 --> 00:47:13.523
Yes. I am really concerned about
local transport with Teesside

1379
00:47:13.523 --> 00:47:13.731
[oral transport with Teesside
airport,

1380
00:47:13.731 --> 00:47:18.440
local transport with Teesside
airport, and what the council has

1381
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.023
airport, and what the council has
done, with business coming back to

1382
00:47:20.023 --> 00:47:22.773
done, with business coming back to
Teesside, and hopefully then

1383
00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.815
Teesside, and hopefully then
bringing transport links back to the

1384
00:47:24.815 --> 00:47:25.065
bringing transport links back to the
north-east,

1385
00:47:25.065 --> 00:47:26.106
bringing transport links back to the
north—east, where we haven’t had any

1386
00:47:26.106 --> 00:47:28.065
north-east, where we haven’t had any
for years. HSZ

00:47:28.065 --> 00:47:28.648
north—east, where we haven’t had any
for years. HS2 totally bypassing the

1388
00:47:28.648 --> 00:47:32.273
for years. HS2 totally bypassing the
north—east. All that money that is

1389
00:47:32.273 --> 00:47:32.898
north-east. All that money that is
being piled

1390
00:47:32.898 --> 00:47:33.940
north—east. All that money that is
being piled into it, we are not

1391
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.731
being piled into it, we are not
going to benefit at all, so it

1392
00:47:35.731 --> 00:47:40.315
going to benefit at all, so it
should be invested into Teesside. So

1393
00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:41.565
should be invested into Teesside. So
the third runway is an irrelevance,

1394
00:47:41.565 --> 00:47:43.231
the third runway is an irrelevance,
as far as you are concerned. The man

1395
00:47:43.231 --> 00:47:47.856
as far as you are concerned. The man
in the white shirt with the glasses.

1396
00:47:47.856 --> 00:47:48.356
in the white shirt with the glasses.
Most peopla

1397
00:47:48.356 --> 00:47:48.898
in the white shirt with the glasses.
Most people in Middlesbrough don’t

1398
00:47:48.898 --> 00:47:49.731
Most peopla in Middlesbrough don’t
really rare or

1399
00:47:49.731 --> 00:47:50.565
Most people in Middlesbrough don’t
really care or know that much about

1400
00:47:50.565 --> 00:47:51.523
really rare or know that much about
what happens

1401
00:47:51.523 --> 00:47:52.481
really care or know that much about
what happens at Heathrow, but I

1402
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:53.523
what happens at Heathrow, but I
think it’s wonderful that Teesside

1403
00:47:53.523 --> 00:47:57.356
think it’s wonderful that Teesside
airport is being reclaimed,

1404
00:47:57.356 --> 00:47:58.231
airport is being reclaimed,
rejuvenated, and more services are

1405
00:47:58.231 --> 00:48:01.190
rejuvenated, and more services are
being provided every week. You are

1406
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.940
being provided every week. You are
baking it up for Teesside. Yes, the

1407
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:09.148
baking it up for Teesside. Yes, the
man at the front in the dark shirt.

1408
00:48:09.148 --> 00:48:09.731
ﬂ

1409
00:48:09.731 --> 00:48:13.356
I think technology is the way
forward. As we have seen with cars

1410
00:48:13.356 --> 00:48:14.356
forward. As we have seen with cars
developing batteries and other

1411
00:48:14.356 --> 00:48:15.981
developing batteries and other
means, by the time this third runway

1412
00:48:15.981 --> 00:48:19.315
means, by the time this third runway
is built, we will have cleaner

1413
00:48:19.315 --> 00:48:20.440
is built, we will have cleaner
planes, electric planes, and that

1414
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.023
planes, electric planes, and that
will be the way forward. I don’t

1415
00:48:22.023 --> 00:48:23.940
will be the way forward. I don’t
think you have to worry so much

1416
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.690
think you have to worry so much
about the emissions because by the

1417
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.815
about the emissions because by the
time it happens, technology will

1418
00:48:26.815 --> 00:48:27.190
time it happens, technology will
have taught

1419
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:28.856
time it happens, technology will
have caught up and we will be in a

1420
00:48:28.856 --> 00:48:30.481
have caught up and we will be in a
better place. So I think it should

1421
00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:35.273
better place. So I think it should
go ahead. Ayesha? I think we should

1422
00:48:35.273 --> 00:48:37.731
go ahead. Ayesha? I think we should
try to use what we have, upgrade it

1423
00:48:37.731 --> 00:48:39.148
try to use what we have, upgrade it
and make it more efficient, not

1424
00:48:39.148 --> 00:48:39.356
try to use what we have, upgrade it
and make it more efficient, notjust

1425
00:48:39.356 --> 00:48:40.440
and make it more efficient, not just
build more

1426
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.648
and make it more efficient, notjust
build more and more things. But I am

1427
00:48:41.648 --> 00:48:46.190
build more and more things. But I am
in favour of trying to spread out

1428
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.023
in favour of trying to spread out
the centres for hubs of transport,

1429
00:48:48.023 --> 00:48:49.190
the centres for hubs of transport,
like the lady was saying about

1430
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.398
like the lady was saying about
Teesside airport. That is fantastic.

1431
00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:52.940
Teesside airport. That is fantastic.
I ﬂaw in

1432
00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.481
Teesside airport. That is fantastic.
I flew in from Dubai to Newcastle

1433
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:56.606
Iﬂew in from Dubai to Nemsﬂa
this morning.

1434
00:48:56.606 --> 00:48:57.731
I flew in from Dubai to Newcastle
this morning. Fantastic airport,

1435
00:48:57.731 --> 00:48:58.606
this morning. Fantastic airport,
superefficient, great flight. The

1436
00:48:58.606 --> 00:48:58.731
superefficient, great ﬂight. The
whola

1437
00:48:58.731 --> 00:49:01.981
superefficient, great flight. The
whole thing works perfectly. And it

1438
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:02.231
whola thing works perfectly. And it
is

1439
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:04.398
whole thing works perfectly. And it
is because emirates is good and it

1440
00:49:04.398 --> 00:49:04.565
is because emirates is good and it
ﬂies

1441
00:49:04.565 --> 00:49:05.815
is because emirates is good and it
flies there. What two other airlines

1442
00:49:05.815 --> 00:49:06.065
ﬂies there. what two other airtines
are of

1443
00:49:06.065 --> 00:49:09.023
flies there. What two other airlines
are of course available! Why aren’t

1444
00:49:09.023 --> 00:49:09.190
are of course available! why aren’t
more

1445
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.773
are of course available! Why aren’t
more airlines doing that? Why are we

1446
00:49:11.773 --> 00:49:12.148
more aidines doing that? why are we
not make

1447
00:49:12.148 --> 00:49:15.606
more airlines doing that? Why are we
not make it more attractive so that

1448
00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:16.398
not make it more attractive so that
peopla go to

1449
00:49:16.398 --> 00:49:18.315
not make it more attractive so that
people go to different hubs? They

1450
00:49:18.315 --> 00:49:20.773
people go to different hubs? They
are not always going to London. That

1451
00:49:20.773 --> 00:49:23.231
are not always going to London. That
is why we want to make it more

1452
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:25.148
is why we want to make it more
attractive for people to go to

1453
00:49:25.148 --> 00:49:27.231
attractive for people to go to
different places around the country.

1454
00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:29.148
different places around the country.
And what about the environment? The

1455
00:49:29.148 --> 00:49:30.940
And what about the environment? The
question was about trade benefits

1456
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.106
question was about trade benefits
versus the environmental impact.

1457
00:49:34.106 --> 00:49:34.731
versus the environmental impact.
where

1458
00:49:34.731 --> 00:49:38.523
versus the environmental impact.
Where does that stand in relation to

1459
00:49:38.523 --> 00:49:38.856
where does that stand in relation to
increasing

1460
00:49:38.856 --> 00:49:39.523
Where does that stand in relation to
increasing flights to other

1461
00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:40.523
increasing ﬂights to other
airports?

1462
00:49:40.523 --> 00:49:42.106
increasing flights to other
airports? It is not about increasing

1463
00:49:42.106 --> 00:49:44.231
airports? It is not about increasing
so much as redistributing flights.

1464
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:45.565
so much as redistributing ﬂights.
Having

1465
00:49:45.565 --> 00:49:46.606
so much as redistributing flights.
Having fewer to London. And more

1466
00:49:46.606 --> 00:49:47.148
Having fewer to London. And more
going to [oral

1467
00:49:47.148 --> 00:49:51.106
Having fewer to London. And more
going to local hubs. I don’t think

1468
00:49:51.106 --> 00:49:52.106
going to [oral hubs. I don’t think
this is going to

1469
00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:52.898
going to local hubs. I don’t think
this is going to happen now. If the

1470
00:49:52.898 --> 00:49:54.565
this is going to happen now. If the
government wanted it to happen, it

1471
00:49:54.565 --> 00:49:55.940
government wanted it to happen, it
would be part of the appeal. There

1472
00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.565
would be part of the appeal. There
is an irony that the courts have

1473
00:49:57.565 --> 00:49:59.315
is an irony that the courts have
come to a judgment that suits Boris

1474
00:49:59.315 --> 00:50:00.940
come to a judgment that suits Boris
johnson, for a

1475
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.231
come to a judgment that suits Boris
Johnson, for a change. But I have

1476
00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:02.731
johnson, for a change. But I have
suddenly

1477
00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:04.148
Johnson, for a change. But I have
suddenly enough change my mind on

1478
00:50:04.148 --> 00:50:06.023
suddenly enough change my mind on
Heathrow. I originally was persuaded

1479
00:50:06.023 --> 00:50:09.273
Heathrow. I originally was persuaded
of the arguments around trade and

1480
00:50:09.273 --> 00:50:10.065
of the arguments around trade and
investment and the economic

1481
00:50:10.065 --> 00:50:11.231
investment and the economic
argument. I remember meeting some of

1482
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:13.440
argument. I remember meeting some of
the trade unions who represented the

1483
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.148
the trade unions who represented the
Heathrow workforce. But the more I

1484
00:50:17.148 --> 00:50:18.731
Heathrow workforce. But the more I
have looked into it and the more I

1485
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:21.898
have looked into it and the more I
have researched it, I cannot see how

1486
00:50:21.898 --> 00:50:23.398
have researched it, I cannot see how
it is compatible with our commitment

1487
00:50:23.398 --> 00:50:26.023
it is compatible with our commitment
to climate change. We cannot deny

1488
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:30.106
to climate change. We cannot deny
the challenge. With the flooding at

1489
00:50:30.106 --> 00:50:30.315
the challenge. with the ﬂooding at
the

1490
00:50:30.315 --> 00:50:31.731
the challenge. With the flooding at
the moment, we are seeing more and

1491
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.773
the moment, we are seeing more and
more extreme weather events. We have

1492
00:50:33.773 --> 00:50:35.731
more extreme weather events. We have
to get serious about the challenge

1493
00:50:35.731 --> 00:50:36.940
to get serious about the challenge
of climate change and what that

1494
00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.398
of climate change and what that
means for the future of humanity and

1495
00:50:38.398 --> 00:50:41.398
means for the future of humanity and
the future of the planet. On those

1496
00:50:41.398 --> 00:50:43.148
the future of the planet. On those
grounds, I hold my hands up and I am

1497
00:50:43.148 --> 00:50:45.273
grounds, I hold my hands up and I am
saying that a few years ago when I

1498
00:50:45.273 --> 00:50:46.856
saying that a few years ago when I
supported Heathrow, I

1499
00:50:46.856 --> 00:50:47.106
saying that a few years ago when I
supported Heathrow, Iwas

1500
00:50:47.106 --> 00:50:47.273
saying that a few years ago when I
supported Heathrow, I was wrong.

1501
00:50:47.273 --> 00:50:47.440
saying that a few years ago when I
supported Heathrow, Iwas wrong. Now

1502
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:53.690
supported Heathrow, Iwas wrong. Now
I don’t think it should go ahead.

1503
00:50:53.731 --> 00:50:56.023
I don’t think it should go ahead.
jon, we are

1504
00:50:56.023 --> 00:50:57.023
I don’t think it should go ahead.
Jon, we are putting £2 billion into

1505
00:50:57.023 --> 00:50:57.273
jon, we are putting £2 billion into
aviation

1506
00:50:57.273 --> 00:50:58.356
Jon, we are putting £2 billion into
aviation research. I would love to

1507
00:50:58.356 --> 00:51:00.231
aviation research. I would love to
invite you to show you what we are

1508
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:06.731
invite you to show you what we are
doing. You probably need 4 billion.

1509
00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:08.648
doing. You probably need 4 billion.
I am so glad to hear people talking

1510
00:51:08.648 --> 00:51:08.773
I am so glad to hear peopla talking
about

1511
00:51:08.773 --> 00:51:11.981
I am so glad to hear people talking
about Teesside airport and what is

1512
00:51:11.981 --> 00:51:15.315
about Teesside airport and what is
being done in terms of offshore wind

1513
00:51:15.315 --> 00:51:16.940
being done in terms of offshore wind
and the supply chain, but also our

1514
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.731
and the supply chain, but also our
traditional industries like the

1515
00:51:18.731 --> 00:51:20.481
traditional industries like the
steel industry. We have a big plan

1516
00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:22.356
steel industry. We have a big plan
to decarbonise not

1517
00:51:22.356 --> 00:51:22.731
steel industry. We have a big plan
to decarbonise notjust transport,

1518
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:23.398
to dearbonise not just transport,
but also

1519
00:51:23.398 --> 00:51:25.190
to decarbonise notjust transport,
but also steel to make the greenest

1520
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.690
but also steel to make the greenest
steel in Europe. One more question

1521
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:30.731
steel in Europe. One more question
from Chris Kelly. The government

1522
00:51:30.731 --> 00:51:32.940
from Chris Kelly. The government
have promised to tackle the number

1523
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.356
have promised to tackle the number
of rough sleepers. As a Salvation

1524
00:51:34.356 --> 00:51:35.356
of rough sleepers. As a Salvation
Army officer in Middlesbrough, I

1525
00:51:35.356 --> 00:51:36.981
Army officer in Middlasbrough, I
have

1526
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:38.231
Army officer in Middlesbrough, I
have seen an increase. When will we

1527
00:51:38.231 --> 00:51:38.690
have seen an increase. when will we
see that

1528
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.606
have seen an increase. When will we
see that change? Chris, tell us

1529
00:51:42.606 --> 00:51:43.606
see that change? Chris, tell us
about your experience of seeing

1530
00:51:43.606 --> 00:51:48.648
about your experience of seeing
rough sleeping in Middlesbrough. We

1531
00:51:48.648 --> 00:51:52.315
rough sleeping in Middlesbrough. We
operate out of Southfield Road. We

1532

operate out of Southfield Road. We
are regularty

00:51:56.856 --> 00:51:57.148
are regularty inundated with peopla
who

1535
00:51:57.148 --> 00:51:59.148
are regularly inundated with people
who have to use our services to get

support, drug addicts. And you have
seen an increase? We have seen an

1540
00:52:08.731 --> 00:52:10.273
seen an increase? We have seen an
increase. There are people trying to

1541
00:52:10.273 --> 00:52:14.148
increase. There are people trying to
sleep around the back of our church

1542
00:52:14.148 --> 00:52:15.606
sleep around the back of our church
buildings, anywhere to get out of

1543
00:52:15.606 --> 00:52:19.773
buildings, anywhere to get out of
the cold and the elements. And it

1544
00:52:19.773 --> 00:52:19.940
the cold and the elaments. And it
has

1545
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.148
the cold and the elements. And it
has increased, yet we are being told

1546
00:52:21.148 --> 00:52:23.690
has increased, yet we are being told
it is a decrease. Well, it has

1547
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:27.773
it is a decrease. Well, it has
decreased this year by 9%. But it

1548
00:52:27.773 --> 00:52:28.148
decreased this year by 996. But it
has nearty

1549
00:52:28.148 --> 00:52:31.148
decreased this year by 9%. But it
has nearly tripled since the

1550
00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:32.190
has nearly tripled since the
Conservatives, or since 2010, which

1551
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.315
Conservatives, or since 2010, which
was a coalition with the

1552
00:52:34.315 --> 00:52:36.481
was a coalition with the
Conservatives, and then a

1553
00:52:36.481 --> 00:52:37.731
Conservatives, and then a
Conservative government. John Bird,

1554
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:38.106
Conservative government. john Bird,
you’re the

1555
00:52:38.106 --> 00:52:39.565
Conservative government. John Bird,
you’re the obvious person to talk to

1556
00:52:39.565 --> 00:52:41.190
you’re the obvious person to talk to
about this. In terms of the impact

1557
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:47.940
about this. In terms of the impact
of rough sleeping on someone... I am

1558
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.315
of rough shaping on someone... I am
an ex-rough

1559
00:52:48.315 --> 00:52:49.106
of rough sleeping on someone... I am
an ex—rough sleeper, and I can

1560
00:52:49.106 --> 00:52:50.731
an ex-rough sleeper, and I ran
honestly tell

1561
00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:51.731
an ex—rough sleeper, and I can
honestly tell you that it’s one of

1562
00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:56.190
honestly tell you that it’s one of
the worst things you can be doing.

1563
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.148
the worst things you ran be doing.
If you are a

1564
00:52:57.148 --> 00:52:58.940
the worst things you can be doing.
If you are a rough sleeper for a

1565
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.398
If you are a rough sleeper for a
couple of months, it takes years to

1566
00:53:00.398 --> 00:53:03.190
couple of months, it takes years to
get it out of you. Even a couple of

1567
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:04.148
get it out of you. Even a couple of
weeks will disenfranchise you in

1568
00:53:04.148 --> 00:53:10.606
weeks will disenfranchise you in
many ways and confusing.

up on the streets,

1575
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:17.356

up on the streets, hiding from the

1576
00:53:17.356 --> 00:53:19.481
up on the streets, hiding from the
police and hiding from my family, so

1577
00:53:19.481 --> 00:53:21.523
police and hiding from my family, so
I wasn’t like a lot of the young

1578
00:53:21.523 --> 00:53:22.940
I wasn’t like a lot of the young
peopla now.

1579
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.940
I wasn’t like a lot of the young
people now. But I can honestly tell

1580
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.565
peopla now. But I ran honestly tell
you that in

1581
00:53:25.565 --> 00:53:26.731
people now. But I can honestly tell
you that in those days, no one was

1582
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:28.190
you that in those days, no one was
allowed to sleep rough, because you

1583
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:29.898
allowed to sleep rough, because you
got nicked. And if you got nicked,

1584
00:53:29.898 --> 00:53:33.940
got nicked. And if you got nicked,
you went into prisons. And then

1585
00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.273
you went into prisons. And then
after a few months, you were let

1586
00:53:36.273 --> 00:53:37.273
after a few months, you were let
out. That was a ridiculous

1587
00:53:37.273 --> 00:53:41.398
out. That was a ridiculous
situation, but the ridiculous

1588
00:53:41.398 --> 00:53:43.023
situation, but the ridiculous
situation we have now, where we have

1589
00:53:43.023 --> 00:53:46.273
situation we have now, where we have
an overspill of the A&E department,

1590
00:53:46.273 --> 00:53:48.731
an overspill of the A&E department,
we have an overspill of the social

1591
00:53:48.731 --> 00:53:50.315
we have an overspill of the social
security office, we have an

1592
00:53:50.315 --> 00:53:54.273
security office, we have an
overspill of all the help that

1593
00:53:54.273 --> 00:53:57.106
overspill of all the help that
charities can give. 50 you have got

1594
00:53:57.106 --> 00:53:59.356
charities ran give. So you have got
this compound

1595
00:53:59.356 --> 00:54:03.731
charities can give. 50 you have got
this compound that is terrible. It

1596
00:54:03.731 --> 00:54:05.731
this compound that is terrible. It
is a human rights abuse, in my

1597
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:07.523
is a human rights abuse, in my
opinion, to let anybody sleep on the

1598
00:54:07.523 --> 00:54:10.440
opinion, to let anybody sleep on the
streets. I would not let one person

1599
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.356
streets. I would not let one person
sleep on the streets. I would create

1600
00:54:14.356 --> 00:54:15.731
sleep on the streets. I would create
therapeutic communities, and I would

1601
00:54:15.731 --> 00:54:18.731
therapeutic communities, and I would
give people places of safety where

give P P
Peo
ty "h
[e laces 01 sale are

1603
00:54:18.898 --> 00:54:21.065
give people places of safety where
you then sort out the problems. I

1604
00:54:21.065 --> 00:54:23.315
you then sort out the problams. I
would

1605
00:54:23.315 --> 00:54:24.231
you then sort out the problems. I
would transfer the whole argument to

1606
00:54:24.231 --> 00:54:27.690
would transfer the whole argument to
the idea that this is about social

1607
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:32.315
the idea that this is about social
health and social well—being. But it

1608
00:54:32.315 --> 00:54:32.523
health and social well-being. But it
comes

1609
00:54:32.523 --> 00:54:33.773
health and social well—being. But it
comes out of austerity. We know it

1610
00:54:33.773 --> 00:54:35.481
comes out of austerity. We know it
comes out of all the problems that

1611
00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:36.481
comes out of all the problams that
peopla have

1612
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:37.731
comes out of all the problems that
people have had around Universal

1613
00:54:37.731 --> 00:54:37.856
peopla have had around Universal
Credit.

1614
00:54:37.856 --> 00:54:39.731
people have had around Universal
Credit. We know it comes out of the

1615
00:54:39.731 --> 00:54:41.815
Credit. We know it comes out of the
fact that the A&E departments are

1616
00:54:41.815 --> 00:54:44.856
fact that the A&E departments are
overfull. We know these things. The

1617
00:54:44.856 --> 00:54:46.481
overfull. We know these things. The
answer in my opinion is that we have

1618
00:54:46.481 --> 00:54:50.273
answer in my opinion is that we have
to stop allowing people on the

1619
00:54:50.273 --> 00:54:53.315
to stop allowing people on the
streets, and we have to give them an

1620
00:54:53.315 --> 00:54:54.231
streets, and we have to give them an
alternative, irrespective of whether

1621
00:54:54.231 --> 00:54:56.940
alternative, irrespective of whether
they want to take it or not. They

1622
00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.856
they want to take it or not. They
are in a health problem. They have

1623
00:54:58.856 --> 00:55:01.231
are in a health problem. They have
mental and physical health problems

1624
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:04.315
mental and physical health problams
and it is

1625
00:55:04.315 --> 00:55:04.940
mental and physical health problems
and it is an absolute abhorrence

1626
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.523
and it is an absolute abhorrence
that we love people to live and die

1627
00:55:07.523 --> 00:55:07.690
that we love peopla to live and die
on

1628
00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:12.856
that we love people to live and die
on the streets.

1629
00:55:13.481 --> 00:55:19.565
on the streets. The young woman with
blonde hair?

1630
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:22.023
blonde hair? Personally, I have had
experts with mental health and

1631
00:55:22.023 --> 00:55:23.481
experts with mental health and
hearing this today, I think some of

1632
00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:25.440
hearing this today, I think some of
you are in a different world, saying

1633
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.731
you are in a different world, saying
you have come in from Dubai to

1634
00:55:27.731 --> 00:55:29.898
you have come in from Dubai to
Newcastle. In Middlesbrough, the

1635
00:55:29.898 --> 00:55:30.398
Nemsﬂa. In Middlasbrough, the
lack of

1636
00:55:30.398 --> 00:55:31.940
Newcastle. In Middlesbrough, the
lack of funding for mental health is

1637
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.773
lack of funding for mental health is
destroying our communities. Even

1638
00:55:32.773 --> 00:55:36.690
destroying our communities. Even
when you do seek help, I read

1639
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.731
when you do seek help, I read
somewhere that there have been three

1640
00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:41.190
somewhere that there have been three
deaths recently in our mental health

1641
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.731
deaths recently in our mental health
hospitals. So

1642
00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:42.731
deaths recently in our mental health
hospitals. 50 when people are

1643
00:55:42.731 --> 00:55:42.898
hospitals. So when peopla are
receiving

1644
00:55:42.898 --> 00:55:44.481
hospitals. 50 when people are
receiving help, they are being let

1645
00:55:44.481 --> 00:55:46.481
receiving help, they are being let
down. It has destroyed our

1646
00:55:46.481 --> 00:55:48.731
down. It has destroyed our
community. Addiction is on the rise.

1647
00:55:48.731 --> 00:55:50.190
community. Addiction is on the rise.
Mental health crises are on the rise

1648
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:52.356
Mental health crises are on the rise
in rough sleeping is on the rise. We

1649
00:55:52.356 --> 00:55:53.773
in rough sleeping is on the rise. We
need funding, and when are we going

1650
00:55:53.773 --> 00:55:59.856
need funding, and when are we going
to get it? Alison?

1651
00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:03.315
to get it? Alison? Again, it is the
second time we have come back to the

1652
00:56:03.315 --> 00:56:07.356
second time we have come back to the
austerity issue today. Homelessness

1653
00:56:07.356 --> 00:56:09.315
austerity issue today. Homelessness
is a tragedy. Today was bitterly

1654
00:56:09.315 --> 00:56:09.523
is a tragedy. Today was hitherty
cold

1655
00:56:09.523 --> 00:56:11.565
is a tragedy. Today was bitterly
cold and I saw this young girl and

1656
00:56:11.565 --> 00:56:11.856
cold and I saw this young girt and
she was

1657
00:56:11.856 --> 00:56:12.065
cold and I saw this young girl and
she was set

1658
00:56:12.065 --> 00:56:13.356
cold and I saw this young girl and
she was satin a sleeping bag, which

1659
00:56:13.356 --> 00:56:13.731
she was sat in a shaping bag, which
was wet

1660
00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:14.731
she was satin a sleeping bag, which
was wet from the ground and she

1661
00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:14.898
she was sat in a sleeping bag, which
was wet from the ground and she was

1662
00:56:14.898 --> 00:56:18.106
was wet from the ground and she was
frozen. This should not be something

1663
00:56:18.106 --> 00:56:19.898
frozen. This should not be something
we are seeing on our streets in one

1664
00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:22.440
we are seeing on our streets in one
of the richest nations on earth. How

1665
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.315
of the richest nations on earth. How
is this happening? The work that the

1666
00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:25.648
is this happening? The work that the
Salvation Army and those great

1667
00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:27.690
Salvation Army and those great
charities do is fantastic, but it

1668
00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:30.856
charities do is fantastic, but it
has to be more than that. There are

1669
00:56:30.856 --> 00:56:33.523
has to be more than that. There are
so many issues coming into this. We

1670
00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:37.898
so many issues coming into this. We
have got abuse of drugs, we have

1671
00:56:37.898 --> 00:56:39.856
have got abuse of drugs, we have
lack of organisations that care for

1672
00:56:39.856 --> 00:56:40.148
lack of organisations that rare for
peopla and

1673
00:56:40.148 --> 00:56:42.356
lack of organisations that care for
people and we also have a massive

1674
00:56:42.356 --> 00:56:42.731
peopla and we also have a massive
housing crisis.

1675
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:43.481
people and we also have a massive
housing crisis. Rough sleeping is

1676
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:44.148
housing crisis. Rough slaeping is
the tip of

1677
00:56:44.148 --> 00:56:45.148
housing crisis. Rough sleeping is
the tip of the iceberg. That is what

1678
00:56:45.148 --> 00:56:47.440
the tip of the iceberg. That is what
we see when we see people in

1679
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.356
we see when we see peopla in
shaping

1680
00:56:48.356 --> 00:56:49.440
we see when we see people in
sleeping bags in doorways. Beneath

1681
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:49.856
shaping bags in doorways. Beneath
that,

1682
00:56:49.856 --> 00:56:51.731
sleeping bags in doorways. Beneath
that, we have thousands of children

1683
00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:53.231
that, we have thousands of children
living in temporary accommodation,

1684
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:55.148
living in temporary accommodation,
sofa surfing. They have no

1685
00:56:55.148 --> 00:56:56.981
sofa surfing. They have no
stability, and all the mental health

1686
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:59.440
stability, and all the mental health
issues that go along that. This is

1687
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.315
issues that go along that. This is
going to cost billions of pounds to

1688
00:57:02.315 --> 00:57:03.940
going to cost billions of pounds to
fix and a major overhaul of our

1689
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.315
fix and a major overhaul of our
housing system. We need homes for

1690
00:57:05.315 --> 00:57:11.523
housing system. We need homes for
families to live in. Ayesha. Some of

1691
00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:13.440
families to live in. Ayesha. Some of
the audience think you are on a

1692
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.731
the audience think you are on a
different planet. 5’ I can assure

1693
00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:15.315
different planet. 5’ I ran assure
you I am

1694
00:57:15.315 --> 00:57:15.523
different planet. 5’ I ran assure
you lam not,

1695
00:57:15.523 --> 00:57:16.398
different planet. 5’ I can assure
you I am not, though I do sometimes

1696
00:57:16.398 --> 00:57:16.940
you lam not, though I do sometimes
work in Dubai,

1697
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:17.981
you I am not, though I do sometimes
work in Dubai, which means I do fly

1698
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:20.981
work in Dubai, which means I do ﬂy
from Dubai.

1699
00:57:20.981 --> 00:57:21.731
work in Dubai, which means I do fly
from Dubai. But for

1700
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:21.898
work in Dubai, which means I do fly
from Dubai. But fora

1701
00:57:21.898 --> 00:57:22.481
work in Dubai, which means I do fly
from Dubai. But for a long time, I

1702
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:22.731
from Dubai. But fora long time, I
had

1703
00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:24.315
from Dubai. But for a long time, I
had a relationship with someone who

1704
00:57:24.315 --> 00:57:25.940
had a relationship with someone who
had been made homeless when he was a

1705
00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.815
had been made homeless when he was a
child. So

1706
00:57:28.815 --> 00:57:28.981
had been made homeless when he was a
child. Sol

1707
00:57:28.981 --> 00:57:30.315
had been made homeless when he was a
child. 50 I was very aware of the

1708
00:57:30.315 --> 00:57:30.481
child. So I was very aware of the
destabilising

1709
00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:31.356
child. 50 I was very aware of the
destabilising effect that that can

1710
00:57:31.356 --> 00:57:31.440
destabilising effect that that ran
have

1711
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.065
destabilising effect that that can
have on someone. I have been close

1712
00:57:36.065 --> 00:57:37.731
have on someone. I have been close
to people who have been through that

1713
00:57:37.731 --> 00:57:39.523
to peopla who have been through that
sort of

1714
00:57:39.523 --> 00:57:41.231
to people who have been through that
sort of privation, and I couldn’t

1715
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:45.731
sort of privation, and I couldn’t
agree more that this is a disgrace

1716
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:47.273
agree more that this is a disgrace
within our highly developed,

1717
00:57:47.273 --> 00:57:48.356
within our highly developed,
affluent society, to walk past

1718
00:57:48.356 --> 00:57:49.648
afﬂuent society, to walk past
peopla in

1719
00:57:49.648 --> 00:57:52.690
affluent society, to walk past
people in doorways, shivering. It is

1720
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.690
people in doorways, shivering. It is
unbelievable. Something has to be

1721
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:57.023
unbelievable. Something has to be
done. We need to open up town halls.

1722
00:57:57.023 --> 00:57:59.315
done. We need to open up town halls.
There just shouldn’t be another

1723
00:57:59.315 --> 00:58:00.315
There just shouldn’t be another
night that people don’t have

1724
00:58:00.315 --> 00:58:03.190
night that people don’t have
somewhere to go at all times. I am

1725
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.315
somewhere to go at all times. I am
1001:

1726
00:58:03.315 --> 00:58:03.565
somewhere to go at all times. I am
100% with

1727
00:58:03.565 --> 00:58:03.731
somewhere to go at all times. I am
10096 with you

1728
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:06.523
somewhere to go at all times. I am
100% with you on that. Should

1729
00:58:06.523 --> 00:58:06.731
10096 with you on that. Should
politicians

1730
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:09.773
100% with you on that. Should
politicians be ashamed about the

1731
00:58:09.773 --> 00:58:10.690
politicians be ashamed about the
destruction of the youth services

1732
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.398
destruction of the youth services
that will exacerbate this problem?

1733
00:58:13.398 --> 00:58:15.481
that will exacerbate this problem?
You think the lack of youth services

1734
00:58:15.481 --> 00:58:21.398
You think the lack of youth services
is partly to blame. Jon? This is

1735
00:58:21.398 --> 00:58:22.856
is partly to blame. Jon? This is
heartbreaking. Thank you, Chris, for

1736
00:58:22.856 --> 00:58:24.523
heartbreaking. Thank you, Chris, for
the work you do with the Salvation

1737
00:58:24.523 --> 00:58:26.106
the work you do with the Salvation
Army. I know you will be out there

1738
00:58:26.106 --> 00:58:28.106
Army. I know you will be out there
in the cold at night time, looking

1739
00:58:28.106 --> 00:58:31.106
in the cold at night time, looking
after and supporting people in the

1740
00:58:31.106 --> 00:58:31.356
after and supporting peopla in the
most

1741
00:58:31.356 --> 00:58:32.231
after and supporting people in the
most desperate circumstances. There

1742
00:58:32.231 --> 00:58:35.356
most desperate circumstances. There
is a disagreement about the exact

1743
00:58:35.356 --> 00:58:36.981
is a disagreement about the exact
number, but I think we all know that

1744
00:58:36.981 --> 00:58:39.815
number, but I think we all know that
the numbers of people sleeping rough

1745
00:58:39.815 --> 00:58:40.315
the numbers of peopla shaping rough
on our

1746
00:58:40.315 --> 00:58:41.523
the numbers of people sleeping rough
on our streets has gone sky high in

1747
00:58:41.523 --> 00:58:46.356
on our streets has gone sky high in
the last ten years. We know local

1748
00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:47.940
the last ten years. We know local
authorities have had their budgets

1749
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.065
authorities have had their budgets
dosed

1750
00:58:48.065 --> 00:58:50.273
authorities have had their budgets
closed and have often had to close

1751
00:58:50.273 --> 00:58:50.731
closed and have often had to dose
beds in

1752
00:58:50.731 --> 00:58:53.065
closed and have often had to close
beds in hospitals. We all know there

1753
00:58:53.065 --> 00:58:53.981
beds in hospitals. We all know there
are over 100,000 children pushed

1754
00:58:53.981 --> 00:58:56.523
are over 100,000 children pushed
from pillar to post in temporary

1755
00:58:56.523 --> 00:58:59.148
from pillar to post in temporary
accommodation, not given a permanent

1756
00:58:59.148 --> 00:59:00.481
accommodation, not given a permanent
home, not knowing where their next

1757
00:59:00.481 --> 00:59:03.565
home, not knowing where their next
meal is coming from. This is surely

1758
00:59:03.565 --> 00:59:07.898
meal is coming from. This is surely
a shameful stain on the soul of this

1759
00:59:07.898 --> 00:59:09.523
a shameful stain on the soul of this
country, when we are one of the

1760
00:59:09.523 --> 00:59:11.731
country, when we are one of the
wealthiest countries in the world.

1761
00:59:11.731 --> 00:59:13.940
wealthiest countries in the world.
We should be getting a grip of this

1762
00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.356
We should be getting a grip of this
problem and putting more money in.

1763
00:59:15.356 --> 00:59:16.940
problem and putting more money in.
The point that was made by someone

1764
00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.356
The point that was made by someone
in the audience about mental health

1765
00:59:19.356 --> 00:59:20.773
in the audience about mental health
services, we know that many of the

1766
00:59:20.773 --> 00:59:23.190
services, we know that many of the
people who are sleeping rough do

1767
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.523
peopla who are shaping rough do
have a

1768
00:59:23.523 --> 00:59:24.356
people who are sleeping rough do
have a desperate need for proper

1769
00:59:24.356 --> 00:59:27.648
have a desperate need for proper
mental health care. They are often

1770
00:59:27.648 --> 00:59:28.565
mental health rare. They are often
grappling

1771
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:29.356
mental health care. They are often
grappling with a serious addiction

1772
00:59:29.356 --> 00:59:30.273
grappling with a serious addiction
problam,

1773
00:59:30.273 --> 00:59:31.106
grappling with a serious addiction
problem, whether it be substance

1774
00:59:31.106 --> 00:59:33.856
problam, whether it be substance
misuse

1775
00:59:33.856 --> 00:59:35.773
problem, whether it be substance
misuse or alcohol, and yet there

1776
00:59:35.773 --> 00:59:37.440
misuse or alcohol, and yet there
health budgets for drug and alcohol

1777
00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:37.565
health budgets for dmg and alcohol
have

1778
00:59:37.565 --> 00:59:40.148
health budgets for drug and alcohol
have been decimated under the

1779
00:59:40.148 --> 00:59:42.065
have been decimated under the
Tories. Indeed, every local

1780
00:59:42.065 --> 00:59:43.148
Tories. Indeed, every [oral
authority in

1781
00:59:43.148 --> 00:59:43.731
Tories. Indeed, every local
authority in the country still

1782
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:45.440
authority in the country still
doesn’t know what its budget will be

1783
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.523
doesn’t know what its budget will be
this April because the government

1784
00:59:46.523 --> 00:59:50.690
this April because the government
have not got around to telling them.

1785
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:51.856
have not got around to telling them.
It is a disgrace. The government

1786
00:59:51.856 --> 00:59:56.065
It is a disgrace. The government
have to do something. Nadhim, you

1787
00:59:56.065 --> 00:59:57.315
have to do something. Nadhim, you
can’t be happy that rough sleeping

1788
00:59:57.315 --> 00:59:58.565
can’t be happy that rough shaping
has hearty

1789
00:59:58.565 --> 01:00:00.148
can’t be happy that rough sleeping
has nearly tripled since 2010. It is

1790
01:00:00.148 --> 01:00:00.315
has nearty tripled since 2010. It is
unacceptable

1791
01:00:00.315 --> 01:00:01.148
has nearly tripled since 2010. It is
unacceptable that anyone should be

1792
01:00:01.148 --> 01:00:03.273
unacceptable that anyone should be
sleeping rough in our country. Do

1793
01:00:03.273 --> 01:00:04.690
shaping rough in our country. Do
you take

1794
01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:05.523
sleeping rough in our country. Do
you take responsibility for it? We

1795
01:00:05.523 --> 01:00:10.148
you take responsibility for it? We
do, and today we announced an

1796
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.898
do, and today we announced an
additional £236 million to deliver

1797
01:00:11.898 --> 01:00:14.106
additional £236 million to deliver
another 6000 places in accommodation

1798
01:00:14.106 --> 01:00:14.690
another 6000 places in accommodation
for peoplc who

1799
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:17.815
another 6000 places in accommodation
for people who are sleeping rough,

1800
01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.106
for peopla who are shaping rough,
bringing the

1801
01:00:19.106 --> 01:00:20.106
for people who are sleeping rough,
bringing the total to 1.2 billion

1802
01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:22.481
bringing the total to 1.2 billion
now. The lady asked about mental

1803
01:00:22.481 --> 01:00:24.315
now. The lady asked about mental
health. You are right. I have seen

1804
01:00:24.315 --> 01:00:26.481
health. You are right. I have seen
it when I was children’s minister.

1805
01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:28.065
it when I was children’s minister.
There is some excellent work being

1806
01:00:28.065 --> 01:00:31.106
There is some excellent work being
done. I went to Leeds council, who

1807
01:00:31.106 --> 01:00:32.815
done. I went to Leeds council, who
put wraparound services around

1808
01:00:32.815 --> 01:00:34.356
put wraparound services around
anyone before they even become

1809
01:00:34.356 --> 01:00:37.648
anyone before they even become
homeless and a rough sleeper,

1810
01:00:37.648 --> 01:00:39.023
homeless and a rough sleeper,
because there are signs. One of them

1811
01:00:39.023 --> 01:00:42.565
because there are signs. One of them
is obviously mental health. And they

1812
01:00:42.565 --> 01:00:46.023
is obviously mental health. And they
put a team around them to keep them

1813
01:00:46.023 --> 01:00:47.148
put a team around them to keep them
in their accommodation. So there are

1814
01:00:47.148 --> 01:00:48.898
in their accommodation. So there are
good examples and we are learning

1815
01:00:48.898 --> 01:00:50.815
good examples and we are learning
from that and putting more money

1816
01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:52.856
from that and putting more money
into it. The prime minister is

1817
01:00:52.856 --> 01:00:54.148
into it. The prime minister is
committed to this. I want every

1818
01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:55.731
committed to this. I want every
child to wake up in their own home

1819
01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:57.940
child to wake up in their own home
and have a healthy meal I go to

1820
01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.773
and have a healthy meal I go to
school and do all the things that we

1821
01:00:59.773 --> 01:01:02.315
school and do all the things that we
want for our own children. The

1822
01:01:02.315 --> 01:01:04.148
want for our own children. The
Salvation Army do phenomenal work,

1823
01:01:04.148 --> 01:01:10.315
Salvation Army do phenomenal work,
but we have got to tackle this.

1824
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.606
but we have got to tackle this. We

1825
01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:12.731
but we have got to tackla this. We
have put

1826
01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:13.440
but we have got to tackle this. We
have put another £34 billion of

1827
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.606
have put another £34 billion of
additional spending to the NHS.

1828
01:01:15.606 --> 01:01:16.773
additional spending to the NHS.
Mental health budgets are going up

1829
01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:20.898
Mental health budgets are going up
as well. And the largest increase in

1830
01:01:20.898 --> 01:01:23.106
as well. And the largest increase in
a decade into local government that

1831
01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:23.690
a decade into [oral government that
we have just

1832
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.898
a decade into local government that
we have just announced.

1833
01:01:23.898 --> 01:01:24.065
a decade into local government that
we havejust announced. But

1834
01:01:24.065 --> 01:01:24.523
a decade into local government that
we have just announced. But it is

1835
01:01:24.523 --> 01:01:25.731
we have just announced. But it is
not just about money,

1836
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:26.690
we have just announced. But it is
notjust about money, it is learning

1837
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.065
not just about money, it is learning
from the

1838
01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:27.856
notjust about money, it is learning
from the best examples, learning

1839
01:01:27.856 --> 01:01:34.690
from the best examples, learning
what works and then putting in that

1840
01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.440
what works and then putting in that
wraparound service. You see it in

1841
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:37.731
wraparound service. You see it in

wraparound service. You see it in

their

1844

local authorities. Leeds cut down
their homelessness by a third

1845
01:01:41.023 --> 01:01:42.523
their homelessness by a third
because of the level of work they

1846
01:01:42.523 --> 01:01:45.731
because of the level of work they
have put in. That is what we need to

1847
01:01:45.731 --> 01:01:47.731
have put in. That is what we need to
invest in and we are making that

1848

From Middlesbrough, bye—bye.

1872
01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:08.065
You have never met a man
likeJimJones.

1873
01:03:08.065 --> 01:03:10.523
My father was building
a new kingdom for himself.

1874
01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:14.440
The more power he got,
the darker the story got.

1875
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.356
910 died...

1876
01:03:22.856 --> 01:03:24.856
Family means new arrivals

1877
01:03:24.856 --> 01:03:26.648
and starting again.

1878
01:03:26.648 --> 01:03:29.315
Burying the past

1879
01:03:29.315 --> 01:03:32.523
and living with the consequences.

1880
01:03:32.523 --> 01:03:34.398
Because whatever life
throws at you...

1881
01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:36.023
SIREN BLARES

1882
01:03:36.023 --> 01:03:37.856
..family...

1883
01:04:01.148 --> 01:04:04.898
Right, take that, Friends reunion —
it’s a Brexitcast reunion,

1884
01:04:04.898 --> 01:04:06.231
right here, right now.

1885
01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:08.148
You don’t even have to wait for it.

1886
01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:10.065
Except we will be
narking about who’s who.

1887
01:04:10.065 --> 01:04:12.856
Like every Friends conversation
within about 30 seconds!

1888
01:04:12.856 --> 01:04:13.981
What did you conclude?

1889
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:15.898
You are the Monica.

1890
01:04:15.898 --> 01:04:18.148
You decided I’m not even
remotely obsessive, I don’t

1891
01:04:18.148 --> 01:04:20.315
know what you’re talking
about and I’m completely calm.

1892
01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:23.148
I really don’t see why
that would be the case.

1893
01:04:23.148 --> 01:04:24.356
Laura, you are the Rachel.

1894
01:04:24.356 --> 01:04:28.856
I tried to have her haircut in 1999,
which didn’t make me look like her.

1895
01:04:28.856 --> 01:04:30.898
Didn’t we all!

1896
01:04:30.898 --> 01:04:34.231
Friends completely passed me
by the first time out, entirely,

1897
01:04:34.231 --> 01:04:35.565
so I’ve never actually seen...

1898
01:04:35.565 --> 01:04:36.815
What?

1899
01:04:36.815 --> 01:04:39.690
I have to admit it, I’ve never seen
an episode of Friends.

1900
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.606
Do you even know what
we’re talking about?

1901
01:04:41.606 --> 01:04:45.481
I am aware of said TV
programme of some years ago,

1902
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:48.565
and I am aware of how popular it is,
and this whole business

1903
01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:50.731
of it coming back.

1904
01:04:50.731 --> 01:04:52.148
That’s amazing!

1905
01:04:52.148 --> 01:04:56.440
Chris, you are to Friends
as a normal person is to the Brexit

1906
01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.606
process, aware of it but...

1907
01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:03.356
I think Chris should be the ditzy
one with the guitar.

1908
01:05:03.356 --> 01:05:04.481
Phoebe.

1909
01:05:04.481 --> 01:05:05.815
Yeah.

1910
01:05:05.815 --> 01:05:09.731
Everyone agreed I was the Ross,
and I said I’d rather be Gunther.

1911
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:12.815
